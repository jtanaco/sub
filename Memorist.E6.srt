11

What did she tell you to do...

12
00:01:56,733 --> 00:01:59,825
- whenever you missed her? - Pray.

13
00:02:00,003 --> 00:02:02,965
She's your guardian angel,

14
00:02:02,973 --> 00:02:04,970
so when you're scared or in pain...

15
00:02:04,975 --> 00:02:06,565
I should pray.

16
00:02:09,613 --> 00:02:12,005

Because your unit told me.

57

And you beat the dispatched officers here?

58

It's as if you were waiting for me.

59

probably changed her name to Han Sun Mi.

66
00:08:31,294 --> 00:08:33,155
You scanned my memories.

67
00:08:34,564 --> 00:08:36,830
That's how you were able to reenact the murder.

68
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,495
Unbelievable.

69
00:08:40,003 --> 00:08:41,470
Explain yourself.

70
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,970
Calm down for a second.

71
00:08:42,972 --> 00:08:45,970
Memory scans don't work like vacuum cleaners.

72
00:08:45,975 --> 00:08:47,940
I don't suddenly suck in all your memories.

73
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,610
When you grabbed me,

74
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:52,410
I was too busy reading Park Ki Dan to know what was happening.

75
00:08:52,415 --> 00:08:53,975
Says you.

76
00:08:54,584 --> 00:08:57,280
Okay, fine. I did see a faint scene.

77
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:59,845
Traumatized memories usually strike first.

78
00:09:03,493 --> 00:09:05,255
All I saw was a drawing in black.

79
00:09:05,595 --> 00:09:08,625
I guessed it was a vase. That's how clueless I was.

80
00:09:08,865 --> 00:09:11,355
- So? - But while scanning Dr. Nam,

81
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:14,100
I saw So Mi coloring the same drawing.

82
00:09:14,103 --> 00:09:17,570
She saw the killer through the keyhole of her closet.

83
00:09:17,574 --> 00:09:19,065
That's when I knew...

84
00:09:19,576 --> 00:09:21,635
that you were her.

85
00:09:24,113 --> 00:09:26,880
Your logic is all over the place.

86
00:09:26,883 --> 00:09:28,550
Well, I'm known for my hunches.

87
00:09:28,551 --> 00:09:31,245
The killer is playing a sick game...

88
00:09:31,254 --> 00:09:32,945
and he's using my memories.

89
00:09:33,556 --> 00:09:35,415
Who else could do that?

90
00:09:35,525 --> 00:09:38,790
You're right. He's challenging us by messing with us all.

91
00:09:38,795 --> 00:09:43,055
But it isn't just you he's toying with.

92
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:46,425
He also insulted...

93
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,395
my past too.

94
00:09:49,205 --> 00:09:50,270
What past?

95
00:09:50,273 --> 00:09:52,565
The killer's after us both.

96
00:09:54,744 --> 00:09:56,935
Tell me about this past of yours. If not,

97
00:09:57,914 --> 00:09:59,505
I'll shoot.

98
00:10:16,265 --> 00:10:18,925
This is the hammer painting delivered to Park Ki Dan.

99

What about it?

100
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,565
I don't know if you heard,

101
00:10:24,741 --> 00:10:27,340
but I don't remember anything from my childhood.

102

Get to the point.

103
00:10:28,845 --> 00:10:30,935
But there's one thing I remember.

104
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:34,875
A woman.

105
00:10:36,285 --> 00:10:38,075
A woman dying.

106
00:10:39,956 --> 00:10:41,685
That's what I saw in the painting.

107
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,915
How the victim was laid, crushed beneath an angel.

108
00:10:44,127 --> 00:10:45,685
The face.

109
00:10:47,163 --> 00:10:49,055
Even the sad expression.

110
00:10:50,033 --> 00:10:53,295
She was probably my mother.

111
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:00,635
The killer mocked the only childhood memory I had.

112

Me?

118
00:12:07,243 --> 00:12:08,835
Move it.

119
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,775
- It's locked. - Step aside.

120
00:12:23,593 --> 00:12:25,285
Captain.

121
00:12:32,435 --> 00:12:34,725
Why didn't you let us in?

122
00:12:35,404 --> 00:12:38,195
Get out. We have to preserve the crime scene.

123
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:40,365
Are they bodies?

124
00:12:41,244 --> 00:12:42,410
Are they people?

125
00:12:42,411 --> 00:12:44,310
It's a work of art created by the killer.

126
00:12:44,313 --> 00:12:45,410
Work of art?

127
00:12:45,414 --> 00:12:49,175
Seeing there are numerous scratches, they attacked each other.

128
00:12:53,256 --> 00:12:55,720
Each other? Why?

129
00:12:55,725 --> 00:12:57,490
The killer probably made them do it,

130
00:12:57,493 --> 00:12:59,785
saying he'll let them live if they killed the other.

00:15:49,732 --> 00:15:52,125
You leave important decisions to luck.

172
00:15:52,401 --> 00:15:55,195
It's what blockheads like you enjoy.

173
00:15:55,404 --> 00:15:58,635
Didn't that blockhead save your life?

174
00:15:59,842 --> 00:16:01,940
- What... - Han Man Pyeong.

175
00:16:01,944 --> 00:16:05,505
- Oh, that? - "Oh, that"?

176
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:08,475
I would've taken care of him even without your help.

177
00:16:10,486 --> 00:16:13,650
And here I was, a little grateful that you removed me as a suspect.

178
00:16:13,656 --> 00:16:15,315
Who removed you?

179
00:16:15,324 --> 00:16:17,390
- Didn't you? - Definitely not.

180
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,985
You're still a usual suspect.

181
00:16:20,463 --> 00:16:23,260
Then what? Are you saying you want to work...

182
00:16:23,265 --> 00:16:24,560
with a prime suspect?

183
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:27,425
"Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer."

184
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,565
Words I swear by.

185
00:16:31,774 --> 00:16:33,240
Remember this.

186
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,535
You must keep all of this a secret...

187
00:16:35,611 --> 00:16:37,135
between us.

188
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:02,365
What are you doing? Is this your first time in a woman's apartment?

189
00:17:03,806 --> 00:17:05,700
What do you mean?

190
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:08,670
I go to women's homes...

191
00:17:08,677 --> 00:17:10,465
all the time.

192
00:17:31,233 --> 00:17:32,755
Come in here.

193
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,985
What is all of this?

194
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:00,555
My case.

195
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:03,085
I've been updating it for 20 years.

196
00:18:13,576 --> 00:18:15,210
(Safety and Happiness, Gyeonggi Metropolitan Police Agency)

197
00:18:15,211 --> 00:18:17,035
Do you know how much I blew?

198
00:18:18,214 --> 00:18:20,575
You said to buy. You said it was a sure thing.

199
00:18:22,151 --> 00:18:24,345
That means to buy.

200
00:18:25,054 --> 00:18:27,275
You're a piece of work.

201
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:30,150
You think the deputy chief of Violent Crimes...

202
00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:31,660
only goes after murderers,

203
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:32,990
don't you?

204
00:18:32,995 --> 00:18:35,990
Fine. Okay. You'll see first-hand how I deal...

205
00:18:35,998 --> 00:18:38,725
with jerks like you who commit securities fraud.

206
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:42,765
If you don't return my money, you won't get your life back either.

207
00:18:52,781 --> 00:18:54,305
Leave already.

208
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:55,880
What about the investigation?

209
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:57,110
Shouldn't you be in school?

210
00:18:57,119 --> 00:18:59,575
I got into Seoul University's Grad School for Public Administration.

211
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,245
Good for you.

212
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:03,850
Did you check the suspects?

213
00:19:03,859 --> 00:19:05,820
Enough!

214
00:19:05,828 --> 00:19:07,630
Do you know how many cases I have?

215
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:09,590
I have piles of perps to catch!

216
00:19:09,598 --> 00:19:12,160
Stop making excuses! What is more important than murder?

217
00:19:12,168 --> 00:19:14,060
Why you little...

218
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:16,895
Just put one officer on it, and I'll...

219
00:19:31,053 --> 00:19:32,675
Get out.

220
00:19:43,832 --> 00:19:45,455
I'll do it myself.

221
00:19:45,834 --> 00:19:49,065
I'll find the killer and bring him here myself!

222
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:52,440
Why that... That brat.

223
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:55,040
Why do you think our parents' killer came back?

224
00:19:55,044 --> 00:19:58,240
Jumping to conclusions is what happens when you follow instincts.

225
00:19:58,247 --> 00:20:00,140
What I'm focusing on is the killer's motive.

226
00:20:00,149 --> 00:20:01,250
What motive?

227
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:04,080
Serial killing is very risky.

228
00:20:04,086 --> 00:20:06,820
But he used the corpses to bait us,

229
00:20:06,822 --> 00:20:08,745
taunting us with our pasts.

230
00:20:09,491 --> 00:20:11,045
What could it be?

231
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:14,415
What is he trying to gain using murder and taunting?

232
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:18,925
Is he bragging about the perfect murder from 20 years ago?

233
00:20:20,402 --> 00:20:22,325
It's not cost-effective.

234
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:25,370
Hold on. Your starting position is wrong.

235
00:20:25,374 --> 00:20:26,670
You can't expect logic from a lunatic.

236
00:20:26,675 --> 00:20:28,440
We'll never catch him with an attitude like that.

237
00:20:28,444 --> 00:20:31,810
We have to accept the fact that he's way above us,

238
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:34,880
so we can stay under him and find his weakness.

239
00:20:34,883 --> 00:20:36,945
Profilers are always like that.

240
00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:38,920
They use too much of their imagination...

241
00:20:38,921 --> 00:20:41,275
and lead the case to the wrong direction.

242
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:44,445
He brought back the murder he committed 20 years ago.

243
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,625
So we should play along and try to find his weakness...

244
00:20:50,032 --> 00:20:51,695
Make sure you don't come out on camera.

245
00:20:52,101 --> 00:20:55,230
Ms. Han, we've identified the victims.

246
00:20:55,237 --> 00:20:56,800
They're both 20-year-old women.

247
00:20:56,805 --> 00:20:59,340
Do you know the juvenile double jeopardy case?

248
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:00,770
The juvenile double jeopardy case?

249
00:21:00,776 --> 00:21:02,470
- Those witches... - Well,

250
00:21:02,478 --> 00:21:05,210
six years ago, a little girl who was an orphan died.

251
00:21:05,214 --> 00:21:07,750
And the culprits turned out to be middle school girls.

252
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,650
They were doing volunteer work at the orphanage for school,

253
00:21:09,652 --> 00:21:11,350
and that's when they killed her.

254
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:13,050
One of them had a crush on this guy, and he was nice to her.

255
00:21:13,055 --> 00:21:14,220
That's why they killed her.

256
00:21:14,223 --> 00:21:16,190
The problem occurred after they got arrested.

257
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:17,960
They were both 13 years old.

258
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,960
They were underage, so they didn't get punished at all.

259
00:21:20,963 --> 00:21:22,030
Those scums.

260
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:24,330
But something was revealed after five years.

261
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:27,395
A screen capture of their text got leaked.

262
00:21:29,138 --> 00:21:32,035
They were mocking the girl who died.

263
00:21:32,841 --> 00:21:35,040
"It felt so great when she died"? My gosh.

264
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:37,640
The public wanted another trial.

265
00:21:37,646 --> 00:21:39,440
But that wasn't possible because of the double jeopardy clause.

266
00:21:39,448 --> 00:21:41,280
And in the end, they hired a lawyer...

267
00:21:41,283 --> 00:21:43,210
and sued the people who badmouthed them online.

268
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:44,875
That's completely...

269
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:51,190
Who's next to you?

270
00:21:51,193 --> 00:21:52,755
How did the autopsy come out?

271
00:21:52,828 --> 00:21:55,960
Are you with a guy? At this hour?

272
00:21:55,964 --> 00:21:58,830
You were right. They seem to have attacked each other.

273
00:21:58,834 --> 00:22:00,500
That was a guy's voice.

274
00:22:00,502 --> 00:22:02,000
Keep me updated.

275
00:22:02,004 --> 00:22:03,400
Okay, I got it.

276
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:05,540
- It's a guy, right? - What if it is?

277
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:08,470
It's dangerous. What if he tries to do something?

278
00:22:08,477 --> 00:22:10,110
Why wouldn't he when they're all alone?

279
00:22:10,112 --> 00:22:12,080
- It'd be worse if he didn't. - What?

280
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:13,910
Ms. Han isn't like that.

281
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:16,850
Will you wake up already? She won't be teaching anymore.

282
00:22:16,852 --> 00:22:20,550
How long are you going to keep liking her?

283
00:22:20,556 --> 00:22:22,920
I don't like her. I respect her.

284
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:25,815
Is that so?

285
00:22:26,962 --> 00:22:30,060
Winter break is almost over, so get ready to go back to school.

286
00:22:30,065 --> 00:22:32,195
Don't bother getting your hopes up.

287
00:22:33,235 --> 00:22:34,825
I'm sure it was a guy.

288
00:22:35,037 --> 00:22:36,925
I bet it was a celebrity.

289
00:22:37,373 --> 00:22:39,870
You mean it came from the TV? It must've been the TV.

290
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:41,140
No, I mean an actual celebrity.

291
00:22:41,143 --> 00:22:43,510
Ms. Han is pretty enough...

292
00:22:43,512 --> 00:22:46,435
to have celebrities lining up to date her.

293
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:51,180
He had a nice voice, right?

294
00:22:51,186 --> 00:22:53,380
It was really sexy.

295
00:22:53,389 --> 00:22:55,615
I bet he's handsome.

296
00:23:02,664 --> 00:23:06,795
Punishing evil by becoming evil themselves.

297
00:23:07,269 --> 00:23:09,295
This guy is a psycho.

298
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,525
It's not the first time.

299
00:23:11,774 --> 00:23:14,135
This also happened 20 years ago.

300
00:23:14,543 --> 00:23:16,205
An execution-style murder.

301
00:23:17,946 --> 00:23:19,535
Execution?

302
00:23:29,258 --> 00:23:32,685
- Where is Reporter Jo Sung Dong? - Over there.

303

(Reporter Jo Sung Dong, Taebook News)

304
00:23:53,615 --> 00:23:56,075
- What do you want? - Can...

305
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:58,920
Can you check a few things for me?

306
00:23:58,921 --> 00:24:01,950
It'll help me identify the culprit.

307
00:24:01,957 --> 00:24:04,720
I'm a reporter, not a detective.

308
00:24:04,726 --> 00:24:06,285
I know.

309
00:24:06,929 --> 00:24:09,655
You wrote about my dad's case.

310
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,330
Mr. Jo, there are other victims other than my dad.

311
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:17,325
- The murders you wrote about... - Hey!

312
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:19,470
You should go see a counselor.

313
00:24:19,475 --> 00:24:22,235
Stop imagining things, and go see a psychiatrist.

314
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:26,935
All these murders lead to the same culprit.

315
00:24:28,183 --> 00:24:30,805
Bother me again and see what happens.

316
00:24:34,189 --> 00:24:37,020
Why don't you just help her out?

317
00:24:37,025 --> 00:24:39,415
Why would I help her? She doesn't even know anything.

318
00:24:39,428 --> 00:24:41,185
She's just a kid.

319
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:43,725
Don't you know who her dad was?

320
00:24:43,932 --> 00:24:46,560
She should be embarrassed of herself.

321
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,070
She'll hear you.

322
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,725
I want her to hear me.

323
00:24:49,838 --> 00:24:53,235
If she knew what her dad did, she wouldn't be able to do this.

324
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:06,015
What? The culprit is whom?

325
00:25:10,359 --> 00:25:11,820
(Personal Details Report)

326
00:25:11,827 --> 00:25:14,685
(Name: Jo Sung Dong)

327
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:17,885
This is absurd. This guy is a famous reporter.

328
00:25:23,005 --> 00:25:25,695
There are five more murders that are very similar.

329
00:25:25,707 --> 00:25:28,335
They were all people who were condemned.

330
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:35,775
"The amputee murder at South Jeolla Province."

331
00:25:35,918 --> 00:25:37,675
Look at this.

332
00:25:37,686 --> 00:25:39,350
The composite is different.

333
00:25:39,354 --> 00:25:40,950
It was a middle-aged lady.

334
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:43,420
The only common thing is that the culprit didn't get caught.

335
00:25:43,425 --> 00:25:45,390
My gosh, you know nothing.

336
00:25:45,394 --> 00:25:46,890
There is something in common.

337
00:25:46,895 --> 00:25:48,725
The scoop went to the same person.

338
00:25:49,998 --> 00:25:51,625
Jo Sung Dong?

339
00:25:54,136 --> 00:25:56,500
What about that?

340
00:25:56,505 --> 00:25:58,140
He's a reporter, so that's his job.

341
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,940
He was always the quickest reporter to get there.

342
00:26:00,943 --> 00:26:03,510
He's a famous reporter. He probably has connections...

343
00:26:03,512 --> 00:26:06,310
No, he was a lot faster.

344
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:07,875
Dad.

345
00:26:08,617 --> 00:26:10,245
Dad!

346
00:26:10,886 --> 00:26:13,615
Dad! Dad!

347
00:27:36,471 --> 00:27:38,765
He definitely got there very fast.

348
00:27:40,042 --> 00:27:42,205
He got there quicker than the cops.

349
00:27:44,346 --> 00:27:46,840
Are you okay? Hurry!

350
00:27:46,848 --> 00:27:49,275
I was too young to catch him back then.

351
00:27:49,518 --> 00:27:51,345
You're still young.

352
00:27:53,221 --> 00:27:55,250
He couldn't have gotten there so quickly if he wasn't the culprit.

353
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:58,220
My gosh, it's like I'm getting fooled by a kid.

354
00:27:58,226 --> 00:28:01,555
That's why you should've referred to my profiling.

355
00:28:04,066 --> 00:28:07,055
You were suspicious of him from the start?

356
00:28:07,069 --> 00:28:08,625
I checked.

357
00:28:09,071 --> 00:28:10,130
Checked what?

358
00:28:10,138 --> 00:28:12,965
He asked me to drink with him and even wanted to go for karaoke.

359
00:28:13,341 --> 00:28:16,505
- I had to run away from him. - He's always like that.

360
00:28:16,878 --> 00:28:19,380
- He has a problem. - It's really exhausting.

361
00:28:19,381 --> 00:28:22,445
It wouldn't be as bad if he didn't get so drunk.

362
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,375
The Executioner.

363
00:28:27,923 --> 00:28:29,645
Who came up with this name?

364
00:28:30,158 --> 00:28:31,745
I did.

365
00:28:33,528 --> 00:28:35,925
You came up with a pretty good title.

366
00:28:36,331 --> 00:28:39,455
He executes people who deserve to...

367
00:28:43,071 --> 00:28:47,565
Well, apart from your dad.

368
00:28:50,378 --> 00:28:54,275
You're right. All the victims were condemned.

369
00:28:55,517 --> 00:28:58,445
The first murder occurred in 1999 at a mountain trail.

370
00:29:00,122 --> 00:29:02,045
"Jamae Welfare Center"?

371
00:29:02,724 --> 00:29:06,620
They kidnapped and killed people to receive a support fund.

372
00:29:06,628 --> 00:29:08,190
They were like the devil.

373
00:29:08,196 --> 00:29:11,830
1999? Isn't that after they were found guilty?

374
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,825
They didn't get punished.

375
00:29:13,969 --> 00:29:15,570
They got released in two years.

376
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:19,365
They killed hundreds of people and only went to jail for two years?

377
00:29:19,441 --> 00:29:21,235
It was during the military regime.

378
00:29:21,276 --> 00:29:24,405
I can't believe they didn't hang people like that.

379
00:29:29,284 --> 00:29:31,575
The body was severely harmed.

380
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:32,950
Why would he harm the corpse?

381
00:29:32,954 --> 00:29:35,745
No, the person was still alive.

382
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:41,585
I didn't bind these cases together because of the motive.

383
00:29:41,763 --> 00:29:43,325
It had to do with how they were murdered.

384
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:45,425
"How"?

385
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:47,560
They were punished while they were alive.

386
00:29:47,569 --> 00:29:50,495
They were tortured for a long time until they finally died.

387
00:29:51,573 --> 00:29:52,640
The statute of limitations had expired,

388
00:29:52,641 --> 00:29:54,165
so he didn't go to jail.

389
00:29:54,276 --> 00:29:56,340
But instead, he was amputated while he was still alive.

390
00:29:56,344 --> 00:29:59,435
Exactly 13 times which was the number of victims.

391
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:02,475
How meticulous.

392
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:05,545
The same happened to the others.

393
00:30:05,687 --> 00:30:08,745
They were brutally tortured until they died.

394
00:30:09,324 --> 00:30:11,390
Why didn't they think of this as a serial murder?

395
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:13,515
Because the suspects all looked different.

396
00:30:14,796 --> 00:30:16,260
There were witnesses?

397
00:30:16,264 --> 00:30:18,225
3 out of the 6 murders.

398
00:30:39,955 --> 00:30:41,715
That witness saw an old man.

399
00:30:43,325 --> 00:30:46,815
In South Jeolla Province, a woman in her 50s was caught on camera.

400
00:30:47,529 --> 00:30:49,025
And the third witness?

401
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:52,255
That was me.

402
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:08,945
May I ask how your father died?

403
00:31:10,318 --> 00:31:12,415
He was stabbed 17 times...

404
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:14,875
in non-lethal areas.

405
00:31:16,758 --> 00:31:18,445
17 times?

406
00:31:19,261 --> 00:31:21,415
The number of deaths...

407
00:31:21,997 --> 00:31:24,485
he was directly or indirectly responsible for.

408
00:31:28,436 --> 00:31:30,165
So what was the conclusion...

409
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:33,135
of your chase of 20 years?

410
00:31:34,376 --> 00:31:36,840
Satisfied? You can go now.

411
00:31:36,845 --> 00:31:38,240
No, I'll stay.

412
00:31:38,246 --> 00:31:41,140
Unbelievable. This isn't some fun game, you know.

413
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:43,550
I can tell if he's lying. I mastered psychology too.

414
00:31:43,551 --> 00:31:46,280
Wait for me out there. It'll soon be over anyway.

415
00:31:46,288 --> 00:31:50,715
People like him crumble once you start hurting their pride.

416
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:16,445
You're a cheeky one, aren't you?

417
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:20,415
I was thoroughly entertained.

418
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:30,130
I only have myself to blame.

419
00:32:30,131 --> 00:32:32,160
- What happened? - Isn't it obvious?

420
00:32:32,167 --> 00:32:34,100
I humiliated myself by believing a kid.

421
00:32:34,102 --> 00:32:36,400
- Why? - He has an alibi.

422
00:32:36,404 --> 00:32:39,395
When your father was murdered, he was with other people.

423
00:32:40,942 --> 00:32:42,735
It doesn't matter.

424
00:32:42,777 --> 00:32:44,610
An accomplice could've helped him get a story.

425
00:32:44,612 --> 00:32:47,140
Who on earth would kill for an exclusive in the news?

426
00:32:47,148 --> 00:32:50,050
- I know you're a kid, but... - That's why he's a killer!

427
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:51,980
At least check for an accomplice.

428
00:32:51,987 --> 00:32:53,020
I already did.

429
00:32:53,021 --> 00:32:55,945
I checked his call logs and traced his whereabouts.

430
00:32:56,124 --> 00:33:00,085
All you did was make me work on a useless case.

431
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:02,355
It doesn't make sense.

432
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:04,925
What about the scar near his ear?

433
00:33:05,533 --> 00:33:07,195
It's from when he served in the military.

434
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:12,295
- That's a lie. - I checked his medical records!

435
00:33:13,174 --> 00:33:14,735
And then what happened?

436
00:33:15,377 --> 00:33:18,665
You're not the type of person who would've let this go.

437
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:21,910
I believed that there was a trick,

438
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:23,545
but nothing panned out.

439
00:33:24,219 --> 00:33:26,445
I followed every lead...

440
00:33:26,721 --> 00:33:28,345
only to hit dead-ends.

441
00:33:33,328 --> 00:33:37,285
What if that trick was a telepathic ability?

442
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,900
What if Jo Sung Dong or whoever it is...

443
00:33:40,902 --> 00:33:43,065
can manipulate other people's memories?

444
00:33:43,738 --> 00:33:45,895
Just like those of the witnesses at the prayer house.

445
00:33:47,642 --> 00:33:50,735
- Sleeping gas was used. - That sounds more of a trick to me.

446
00:33:51,012 --> 00:33:54,035
Even the guards outside had their memories erased.

447
00:33:55,417 --> 00:33:59,080
But what if this wasn't a crime committed...

448
00:33:59,087 --> 00:34:00,615
by someone with superpowers?

449
00:34:04,025 --> 00:34:06,115
Then it's someone who knows everything.

450
00:34:06,161 --> 00:34:08,055
Someone who has vast knowledge.

451
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:09,955
It could be...

452
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:13,695
a member of the police force.

453
00:34:16,905 --> 00:34:18,935
Why did the Executioner...

454
00:34:20,708 --> 00:34:22,465
disappear 20 years ago?

455
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:24,365
Why did he stop killing?

456
00:34:25,814 --> 00:34:28,035
Well, he's back now.

457
00:34:28,716 --> 00:34:30,205
Is he?

458
00:34:30,752 --> 00:34:33,745
I thought you told me not to be biased.

459
00:34:33,855 --> 00:34:35,550
My ideas are based on the facts...

460
00:34:35,557 --> 00:34:37,785
while yours are based on your hunches.

461
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:45,955
Isn't this near Yeom Hwa Ran's vacation home?

462
00:34:46,634 --> 00:34:48,455
This is a recent footage.

463
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:54,140
Perps circle back to the scene of their crimes.

464
00:34:54,142 --> 00:34:56,405
It's why I've been filming these.

465
00:34:56,678 --> 00:34:58,165
Would he have come by?

466
00:34:58,646 --> 00:35:00,205
No.

467
00:35:00,381 --> 00:35:02,705
There weren't many spectators anyway.

468
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:06,115
- Then what? - An uninvited guest.

469
00:35:06,321 --> 00:35:07,845
An uninvited guest?

470
00:35:20,902 --> 00:35:22,465
The broadcast van.

471
00:35:22,937 --> 00:35:25,240
The broadcast van drove up before the police line went up.

472
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,100
The pattern is repeating.

473
00:35:27,108 --> 00:35:29,265
The pattern from 20 years ago.

474
00:35:32,247 --> 00:35:34,935
(Honest and impartial, TVC)

475
00:35:36,651 --> 00:35:38,080
I don't quite follow.

476
00:35:38,086 --> 00:35:40,980
I want to know how your broadcast van...

477
00:35:40,989 --> 00:35:42,545
was at the scene.

478
00:35:43,591 --> 00:35:46,190
We never violate an embargo order.

479
00:35:46,194 --> 00:35:49,160
The van was only there just in case.

480
00:35:49,164 --> 00:35:50,460
Are you really this awful at your job...

481
00:35:50,465 --> 00:35:52,000
or just pretending to be?

482
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,325
What? You...

483
00:35:54,702 --> 00:35:58,395
The media is supposed to deliver news to the people.

484
00:36:00,175 --> 00:36:02,035
How did you know...

485
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:03,935
that there was a case?

486
00:36:07,348 --> 00:36:09,675
There's nothing weird about reporters sniffing stories.

487
00:36:09,717 --> 00:36:12,380
It is if you arrived before the police.

488
00:36:12,387 --> 00:36:14,645
And if it happened on multiple occasions.

489
00:36:21,696 --> 00:36:24,785
You were there before the police arrived.

490
00:36:33,541 --> 00:36:35,165
Who tipped you off?

491
00:36:35,877 --> 00:36:37,605
An anonymous source.

492
00:36:37,712 --> 00:36:39,010
Even if we knew who it was,

493
00:36:39,013 --> 00:36:41,175
we have an obligation to protect our source.

494
00:36:41,783 --> 00:36:43,050
An anonymous source?

495
00:36:43,051 --> 00:36:44,510
Didn't it occur to you...

496
00:36:44,519 --> 00:36:48,575
that this anonymous source could be the killer?

497
00:36:51,025 --> 00:36:52,920
We were cross-checking facts.

498
00:36:52,927 --> 00:36:55,120
The tip could've been a hoax, so...

499
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:58,455
And yet you rolled out a broadcast van to the scene?

500
00:37:03,204 --> 00:37:04,725
What do you want?

501
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:07,270
- Tell me who your source is. - We have an obligation...

502
00:37:07,275 --> 00:37:08,965
to protect our sources.

503
00:37:11,579 --> 00:37:13,275
I bet it came from the inside.

504
00:37:21,422 --> 00:37:23,150
Someone from above.

505
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:24,815
Someone of high status.

506
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,755
The boss?

507
00:38:07,502 --> 00:38:09,995
Only the police officers have been asked to enter.

508
00:38:10,271 --> 00:38:13,365
- What about me? - You are to wait out here too.

509
00:38:13,641 --> 00:38:16,140
His lawyer should be present though.

510
00:38:16,144 --> 00:38:18,565
No, he will only talk to the officers.

511
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:51,135
I was thoroughly entertained.

512
00:38:56,451 --> 00:38:59,915
Goodness, it's so nice to meet you.

513
00:38:59,987 --> 00:39:02,550
As a fan, I've made numerous requests, you know.

514
00:39:02,557 --> 00:39:05,420
I've been suggesting we do a special featured series with you.

515
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:07,515
One of at least 20 episodes.

516
00:39:07,862 --> 00:39:09,785
I'd love that too.

517
00:39:14,936 --> 00:39:16,465
Shall we?

518
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:21,470
I'm too low on the totem pole to do anything freely.

519
00:39:21,476 --> 00:39:25,165
That includes being on TV and even arresting bad guys.

520
00:39:38,993 --> 00:39:40,785
It's Superintendent Han, right?

521
00:39:41,162 --> 00:39:42,530
I'm Han Sun Mi.

522
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:44,255
I know you quite well.

523
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:48,055
Almost everyone wants you in charge of their office.

524
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:51,525
- Are you interested in politics? - I'm happy where I am.

525
00:39:52,106 --> 00:39:53,670
Of course it's satisfying.

526
00:39:53,674 --> 00:39:56,410
But those who are gifted should take the reins...

527
00:39:56,411 --> 00:39:58,040
regardless of what their calling is.

528
00:39:58,045 --> 00:39:59,875
I'm sure you're aware that Park Ki Dan died.

529
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:02,135
Yes, but the embargo hasn't been lifted.

530
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:05,075
This country loves embargoes too much.

531
00:40:05,086 --> 00:40:06,650
When will they learn that...

532
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:08,520
a leading country begins with the transparency of information.

533
00:40:08,523 --> 00:40:11,290
And that is the responsibility of the media.

534
00:40:11,292 --> 00:40:14,285
So where did the information of the murder come from?

535
00:40:14,862 --> 00:40:17,385
Sorry? I don't follow.

536
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:19,395
Let's be honest here.

537
00:40:19,934 --> 00:40:23,265
Be a member of a leading nation and be transparent with information.

538
00:40:26,574 --> 00:40:29,765
You can't just simply ask for trade secrets, you know.

539
00:40:29,777 --> 00:40:31,265
Why don't I guess?

540
00:40:31,879 --> 00:40:35,605
It's probably tips on murders received from a serial killer.

541
00:40:36,717 --> 00:40:40,580
It wasn't the first time. The exclusives from 20 years ago...

542
00:40:40,588 --> 00:40:43,245
were also thanks to your collusion with the killer.

543
00:40:44,425 --> 00:40:47,355
Collusion.

544
00:40:47,395 --> 00:40:50,025
Either that, or you sent an accomplice to commit the murders.

545
00:40:50,231 --> 00:40:51,955
All for exclusive stories.

546
00:40:52,633 --> 00:40:54,895
Your imagination is way too wild.

547
00:40:56,437 --> 00:40:58,125
Spill it.

548
00:40:58,673 --> 00:41:01,765
If you don't tell the truth, we'll arrest you for murder.

549
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:07,780
Even if I did receive information, why is that a problem?

550
00:41:07,782 --> 00:41:10,310
It wasn't before the murders. We went afterward.

551
00:41:10,318 --> 00:41:11,980
Are you kidding me?

552
00:41:11,986 --> 00:41:13,620
If you had reported the serial murder,

553
00:41:13,621 --> 00:41:16,145
we would've reduced the number of victims 20 years ago.

554
00:41:18,926 --> 00:41:21,715
The police knew already.

555
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:26,500
You must be threatening me with the past to get something from me,

556
00:41:26,501 --> 00:41:27,930
but you came to the wrong guy.

557
00:41:27,935 --> 00:41:31,925
You people are the ones who will get hurt if it gets out, not me.

558
00:41:32,206 --> 00:41:35,040
Did you say the police knew?

559
00:41:35,042 --> 00:41:37,610
Are you assuming that the cops back then were all idiots?

560
00:41:37,612 --> 00:41:39,165
They knew.

561
00:41:40,381 --> 00:41:43,750
- That's nonsense. - They buried it.

562
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:45,550
What cop would admit there is a serial killer on the loose...

563
00:41:45,553 --> 00:41:47,650
that they couldn't catch?

564
00:41:47,655 --> 00:41:49,275
It would kill their career.

565
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:53,755
Then and now, the cops are the same.

566
00:41:54,061 --> 00:41:57,290
You shouldn't talk. You colluded with a killer for exclusives!

567
00:41:57,298 --> 00:42:00,055
Who colluded with a killer? I did not.

568
00:42:00,334 --> 00:42:03,300
The killer wanted the world to know...

569
00:42:03,304 --> 00:42:05,865
that people who deserved to die were dying at his hands.

570
00:42:05,873 --> 00:42:07,570
But I didn't do it.

571
00:42:07,575 --> 00:42:09,670
Sure,

572
00:42:09,677 --> 00:42:12,170
it would've been a bigger exclusive if I had uncovered a serial murder.

573
00:42:12,179 --> 00:42:15,440
But I had the conviction of a journalist,

574
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:17,250
in contrast to you people who buried it...

575
00:42:17,251 --> 00:42:19,515
out of fear of missing a promotion.

576
00:42:20,288 --> 00:42:21,915
The conviction of a journalist?

577
00:42:22,223 --> 00:42:26,385
No. You were waiting for the right time to say it was a serial killer.

578
00:42:26,694 --> 00:42:31,285
But it fell through because the police figured it out.

579
00:42:31,432 --> 00:42:33,160
It must be nice being a cop.

580
00:42:33,167 --> 00:42:34,700
You can say any garbage you want.

581
00:42:34,702 --> 00:42:37,525
That's an exclusive right held by journos like you.

582
00:42:42,543 --> 00:42:44,235
They're leaving.

583
00:42:44,545 --> 00:42:46,680
Tell me who the informant is.

584
00:42:46,681 --> 00:42:48,740
How dare you ask for information on a source?

585
00:42:48,749 --> 00:42:51,180
If you're so curious, dig through the records.

586
00:42:51,185 --> 00:42:55,375
They were much smarter than you people now.

587
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:02,415
I always wondered...

588
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:06,355
whether the media was garbage because of society,

589
00:43:06,567 --> 00:43:10,525
or if society is what it is because of the media.

590
00:43:11,639 --> 00:43:13,765
Thanks for enlightening me.

591
00:43:30,091 --> 00:43:33,915
(Documents)

592
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:46,800
- Hey. - There's nothing...

593
00:43:46,807 --> 00:43:48,895
on Kim So Mi's case from year 2000.

594
00:43:48,943 --> 00:43:51,740
I don't need the content. Who was the detective on point?

595
00:43:51,746 --> 00:43:52,880
(Old man)

596
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,310
The deputy chief of Metropolitan Investigation at Gyeonggi...

597
00:43:55,316 --> 00:43:58,180
at the time was Chun Ki Soo. I know him.

598
00:43:58,185 --> 00:44:00,050
He's a section chief at HQ now. Why?

599
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:01,615
It's not him.

600
00:44:01,989 --> 00:44:04,290
Get me the names of everyone who was on that case.

601
00:44:04,291 --> 00:44:05,350
Why?

602
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:08,390
- Just do it! - I'm your supervisor, you punk.

603
00:44:08,396 --> 00:44:10,490
I have a higher rank than you.

604
00:44:10,498 --> 00:44:13,460
But you order this old man around without explaining anything.

605
00:44:13,467 --> 00:44:16,525
There you go again. Is this a lover's quarrel?

606
00:44:16,804 --> 00:44:20,735
I need to ask the lead detective something, that's why.

607
00:44:21,475 --> 00:44:24,335
It went to Special Investigations afterward. Do you want that too?

608
00:44:25,379 --> 00:44:27,310
- Special Investigations? - That's right.

609
00:44:27,314 --> 00:44:31,145
They reinvestigated that case and a few other cold cases.

610
00:44:34,055 --> 00:44:35,320
Really?

611
00:44:35,322 --> 00:44:37,090
I called Chun Ki Soo...

612
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:38,650
because the file was so empty,

613
00:44:38,659 --> 00:44:41,190
and he blamed Special Investigations.

614
00:44:41,195 --> 00:44:43,255
He said they handed everything over so he knew nothing.

615
00:44:43,364 --> 00:44:44,630
What about Special Investigations' files?

616
00:44:44,632 --> 00:44:45,730
There's nothing left.

617
00:44:45,733 --> 00:44:47,500
They dissolved the unit...

618
00:44:47,501 --> 00:44:50,270
and sent them all back to where they were before.

619
00:44:50,271 --> 00:44:53,700
They say what they gathered for this archive is everything.

620
00:44:53,708 --> 00:44:55,910
They were either sloppy from the get-go,

621
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:58,210
or they lost the entire box.

622
00:44:58,212 --> 00:44:59,905
It was a long time ago.

623
00:45:00,681 --> 00:45:03,380
There are no records from Special Investigations?

624
00:45:03,384 --> 00:45:05,650
There's only one batch of documents.

625
00:45:05,653 --> 00:45:07,345
The lead detective was...

626
00:45:09,457 --> 00:45:11,015
What?

627
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:13,555
It was Deputy Chief Lee.

628
00:45:14,195 --> 00:45:15,785
Lee Shin Woong?

629
00:45:15,830 --> 00:45:18,030
That's right. The National Police Agency's second in command.

630
00:45:18,032 --> 00:45:19,030
(Special Investigations Unit for Cold Cases)

631
00:45:19,033 --> 00:45:20,725
(Lead Detective Lee Shin Woong)

00:45:35,049 --> 00:45:42,945
(Deputy Chief Lee Shin Woong)

634
00:45:48,929 --> 00:45:52,585
Captain? You borrowed money from Baek, didn't you?

635
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:57,825
Either that, or he read your memory and knows...

636
00:45:57,872 --> 00:45:59,465
your deep dark secrets.

637
00:46:00,341 --> 00:46:02,535
What are you babbling about?

638
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:05,270
It's suspicious how you serve him.

639
00:46:05,279 --> 00:46:06,905
I don't serve him.

640
00:46:06,981 --> 00:46:10,010
"Old man, go get the file for a cold case."

641
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:13,315
And you run right over like a dog chasing a ball.

642
00:46:13,821 --> 00:46:16,390
That's what a true leader does.

643
00:46:16,390 --> 00:46:18,985
Like Admiral Yi Sun Sin.

644
00:46:20,427 --> 00:46:24,025
I doubt Admiral Yi Sun Sin would've run copy errands.

645
00:46:25,733 --> 00:46:28,155
If they had copiers back then,

646
00:46:28,502 --> 00:46:30,765
he would've done hundreds.

647
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,035
That must be it.

648
00:46:35,242 --> 00:46:36,805
What?

649
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:40,935
What is it?

650
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:48,120
"I've made the copies, my lord."

651
00:46:48,122 --> 00:46:50,085
Shut it before I kick you out.

652
00:46:59,133 --> 00:47:01,355
(Special Investigations Unit for Cold Cases)

653
00:47:02,770 --> 00:47:04,565
Do you think Deputy Chief Lee...

654
00:47:04,572 --> 00:47:06,225
is the man you described?

655
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:09,395
Someone with vast information.

656
00:47:10,311 --> 00:47:12,205
It's very possible.

657
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:16,775
What if they buried it because they failed to figure it out?

658
00:47:17,618 --> 00:47:19,245
That's also possible...

659
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:22,180
since the investigation was up against a brick wall...

660
00:47:22,189 --> 00:47:23,785
and the murders stopped.

661
00:47:24,391 --> 00:47:26,555
Then let's go after him first.

662
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:29,120
- How? - Either attack head-on...

663
00:47:29,129 --> 00:47:30,725
or tail him.

664
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:33,100
He uses the Intelligence Bureau like his personal agency.

665
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,800
The Intelligence Bureau?

666
00:47:34,802 --> 00:47:37,570
The NPA's Intelligence Bureau has a wider reach than the NIS.

667
00:47:37,571 --> 00:47:39,125
At least domestically.

668
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:42,595
We'll be caught before we can catch him.

669
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:44,305
What are our other options?

670
00:47:44,411 --> 00:47:46,105
We have to find a way.

671
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:49,080
We're back to square one, but we have a target now.

672
00:47:49,083 --> 00:47:51,650
- Lee Shin Woong. - You're being too relaxed again.

673
00:47:51,652 --> 00:47:53,350
The serial killer is out killing people.

674
00:47:53,354 --> 00:47:56,585
When will we find a way, investigate him, and catch the killer?

675
00:48:09,003 --> 00:48:10,565
Square one.

676
00:48:12,373 --> 00:48:13,935
Square one.

677
00:48:15,042 --> 00:48:16,835
We had forgotten square one.

678
00:48:17,411 --> 00:48:19,775
The first moment they began hunting the Executioner.

679
00:48:21,081 --> 00:48:22,750
We have a witness.

680
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:25,045
Someone who clearly saw the Executioner.

681
00:48:27,521 --> 00:48:29,075
As in...

682
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:31,685
That's right.

683
00:48:33,193 --> 00:48:34,815
You.

684
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,195
My memory.

685
00:48:47,207 --> 00:48:50,205
My memory is already recorded in the documents,

686
00:48:51,712 --> 00:48:53,575
so there's no need to scan it.

687
00:49:01,422 --> 00:49:04,085
Do you know why I didn't close my eyes when my dad was dying?

688
00:49:04,291 --> 00:49:05,590
To remember.

689
00:49:05,592 --> 00:49:08,460
To see every little detail of that horrendous sight...

690
00:49:08,462 --> 00:49:10,225
and remember it clearly.

691
00:49:10,497 --> 00:49:12,185
What happened to that indomitable spirit?

692
00:49:13,801 --> 00:49:16,055
You reached out to shake my hand first.

693
00:49:19,473 --> 00:49:21,295
Let's check and see...

694
00:49:22,009 --> 00:49:23,605
if you missed anything.

695
00:49:27,781 --> 00:49:29,375
Ma'am.

696
00:49:30,317 --> 00:49:33,415
You're wary of investigations using telepathy, right?

697
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:36,075
You only trust logic and reason.

698
00:49:37,891 --> 00:49:39,385
But you see,

699
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,660
intuition is needed sometimes.

700
00:49:42,663 --> 00:49:45,425
When a person experiences something big,

701
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,695
it mostly happens by coincidence, not reason.

702
00:49:49,470 --> 00:49:53,335
Just like how you witnessed that horrible incident.

703
00:50:03,851 --> 00:50:06,045
What do I need to do?

704
00:50:08,322 --> 00:50:09,915
Nothing.

705
00:51:44,118 --> 00:51:45,645
The mask.

706
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:47,715
The silicon mask.

707
00:51:50,491 --> 00:51:52,085
Prosthetic makeup.

708
00:52:15,349 --> 00:52:17,410
He purposely made sure there were witnesses.

709
00:52:17,417 --> 00:52:19,050
But he also made sure he looked different every time.

710
00:52:19,052 --> 00:52:21,620
Let's check all the prosthetic makeup artists from back then.

711
00:52:21,622 --> 00:52:22,680
That will take too long.

712
00:52:22,689 --> 00:52:24,845
No, I'm sure we'll find someone.

713
00:52:27,661 --> 00:52:29,255
Wait.

714
00:52:30,430 --> 00:52:32,685
Why Jo Sung Dong?

715
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:38,465
Why did he only tip-off Jo Sung Dong?

716
00:52:40,274 --> 00:52:43,505
As an executioner who needed to inform his murders,

717
00:52:43,810 --> 00:52:46,365
it would've been better to contact different reporters.

718
00:52:47,548 --> 00:52:49,275
But why...

719
00:52:52,452 --> 00:52:54,045
Why?

720
00:52:56,023 --> 00:52:58,145
Why did it have to be Jo Sung Dong?

721
00:53:03,997 --> 00:53:06,585
Wait. Wait.

722
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:12,630
(Reporter Jo Sung Dong)

723
00:53:12,639 --> 00:53:14,335
These scoops...

724
00:53:15,042 --> 00:53:16,635
He wasn't alone.

725
00:54:55,042 --> 00:54:56,595
It's him.

726
00:55:01,181 --> 00:55:03,235
The cameraman...

727
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:06,045
who got there second.

728
00:55:06,853 --> 00:55:08,415
Yes.

729
00:55:20,801 --> 00:55:23,700
He worked with Jo Sung Dong for two years as his cameraman...

730
00:55:23,704 --> 00:55:25,670
exactly during the serial murders.

731
00:55:25,672 --> 00:55:28,640
Before that, he used to work in the prosthetic makeup team.

732
00:55:28,642 --> 00:55:30,670
After he quit, he emigrated to China.

733
00:55:30,677 --> 00:55:32,410
But he came back two months ago.

734
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:34,080
He's currently living at a place...

735
00:55:34,081 --> 00:55:36,175
that's only 20 minutes away by foot from Yeom Hwa Ran's place.

736
00:58:51,378 --> 00:58:54,440
(Memorist)

737
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:56,850
We will be carrying out a search and seizure...

738
00:58:56,850 --> 00:58:58,810
at Jin Jae Gyu's house.

739
00:58:58,818 --> 00:59:01,315
Three more people will die.

740
00:59:01,321 --> 00:59:03,390
We need to keep our eyes on everyone.

741
00:59:03,390 --> 00:59:05,585
Ms. Han, HR just called.

742
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:07,620
Why did you do that?

743
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:10,430
Are you close with Mr. Jo Sung Dong?

744
00:59:10,430 --> 00:59:13,330
These are the people I touched. You can choose from there.

745
00:59:13,333 --> 00:59:17,370
Thy will die once the moon rises.

746
00:59:17,370 --> 00:59:19,025
It will be a gruesome death.

747
00:59:19,139 --> 00:59:21,935
I found out Jin Jae Gyu's trick.
