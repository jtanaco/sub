00:00:10.297 --> 00:00:12.026
(All characters, places, companies,)

00:00:12.026 --> 00:00:13.872
(and incidents in this drama are fictitious.)

00:00:28.717 --> 00:00:30.751
I know a warm person.

00:00:34.417 --> 00:00:35.961
When I'm next to him,

00:00:37.187 --> 00:00:39.702
I feel warm, like a kettle on top of a stove.

00:00:42.526 --> 00:00:45.627
The lights-out ceremony with Hyecheon City will begin soon.

00:00:45.627 --> 00:00:47.097
Please gather in the school grounds...

00:00:47.097 --> 00:00:50.036
to watch the lights-out ceremony.

00:00:50.036 --> 00:00:51.907
And like I told you earlier,

00:00:51.907 --> 00:00:53.942
if you make a wish when the lights are out...

00:00:55.536 --> 00:00:57.106
Who knows? When the lights come back on,

00:00:57.106 --> 00:00:59.022
your wish may really come true.

00:01:12.726 --> 00:01:13.801
Hae Won.

00:01:29.937 --> 00:01:32.005
We have 10 seconds left until the lights-out ceremony.

00:01:32.006 --> 00:01:33.221
I'll begin the countdown.

00:01:33.446 --> 00:01:34.521
Ten,

00:01:36.816 --> 00:01:37.891
nine,

00:01:40.116 --> 00:01:41.191
eight,

00:01:43.756 --> 00:01:44.831
seven,

00:01:47.157 --> 00:01:48.232
six,

00:01:50.657 --> 00:01:51.741
five,

00:01:53.997 --> 00:01:55.072
four,

00:01:57.836 --> 00:01:58.982
three,

00:02:00.907 --> 00:02:01.982
two,

00:02:03.706 --> 00:02:05.281
- Is... - one.

00:02:05.577 --> 00:02:06.881
something...

00:02:07.206 --> 00:02:08.292
Lights out.

00:02:22.826 --> 00:02:24.002
I like you.

00:02:30.666 --> 00:02:32.382
I like you, Eun Seop.

00:02:48.416 --> 00:02:51.532
Well, have you all made a wish?

00:02:52.326 --> 00:02:53.961
It's time to turn the lights back on.

00:02:55.796 --> 00:02:56.871
Lights on.

00:03:30.027 --> 00:03:31.942
I like you, Eun Seop.

00:03:35.036 --> 00:03:36.111
Right...

00:03:36.766 --> 00:03:37.912
Eun Seop.

00:03:41.036 --> 00:03:42.111
Okay.

00:03:43.036 --> 00:03:44.111
What?

00:03:48.347 --> 00:03:50.446
Eun Seop. Mr. Park is here.

00:03:50.446 --> 00:03:52.687
I told you to come... Oh, Hae Won's here too.

00:03:52.687 --> 00:03:53.747
What are you two doing here?

00:03:53.747 --> 00:03:55.816
I told you to gather at the school grounds.

00:03:55.816 --> 00:03:57.687
- Let's go and talk. - What? Where?

00:03:57.687 --> 00:03:59.627
- Let's go and talk. - Go where?

00:03:59.627 --> 00:04:01.602
What are you doing?

00:04:04.157 --> 00:04:08.066
Hae Won, did you just tell Eun Seop that you liked him...

00:04:08.066 --> 00:04:09.371
and get rejected?

00:04:09.867 --> 00:04:11.097
- No, it's... - Oh, my gosh.

00:04:11.097 --> 00:04:12.636
Why in the world would you like Eun Seop?

00:04:12.636 --> 00:04:14.166
Oh, my gosh!

00:04:14.166 --> 00:04:15.651
I can't believe it!

00:04:23.746 --> 00:04:28.656
(Episode 7: The Road to the Cottage)

00:04:28.657 --> 00:04:31.017
Can you believe it started raining as soon as the event ended?

00:04:31.017 --> 00:04:32.162
I know.

00:04:33.356 --> 00:04:36.257
Hey, wasn't Hyo Joon so funny earlier?

00:04:36.257 --> 00:04:38.371
"Hi! Hi, guys."

00:04:39.097 --> 00:04:41.697
He hasn't changed one bit.

00:04:41.697 --> 00:04:43.496
How long has it been since you came here?

00:04:43.496 --> 00:04:46.207
Me? I didn't come last year...

00:04:46.207 --> 00:04:47.282
so, two years?

00:04:47.467 --> 00:04:50.681
Hae Won, you came here every year for the holidays, right?

00:04:51.876 --> 00:04:53.222
- Hae Won! - What?

00:04:54.676 --> 00:04:55.717
Oh, yes.

00:04:55.717 --> 00:04:57.246
Wait, that's not true.

00:04:57.246 --> 00:05:00.991
From what I heard, Hae Won didn't come here for about 3 to 4 years.

00:05:01.046 --> 00:05:02.892
Oh, well...

00:05:04.017 --> 00:05:06.186
I came when my grandma passed away,

00:05:06.186 --> 00:05:08.296
during Thanksgiving, and...

00:05:08.296 --> 00:05:09.626
By the way,

00:05:09.626 --> 00:05:12.527
how was it with Yeong Woo today? Tell us, Hae Won.

00:05:12.527 --> 00:05:16.097
Right! You were talking with Yeong Woo privately earlier.

00:05:16.097 --> 00:05:17.542
Oh, he said...

00:05:18.036 --> 00:05:20.582
- What did he say? - What did he say?

00:05:22.207 --> 00:05:23.436
- What? - What is it?

00:05:23.436 --> 00:05:24.546
- What did he say? - Why?

00:05:24.546 --> 00:05:26.381
Come on, tell us!

00:06:03.947 --> 00:06:05.092
I like you.

00:06:05.817 --> 00:06:06.892
Okay.

00:06:07.347 --> 00:06:08.561
I like you.

00:06:09.486 --> 00:06:10.561
Okay.

00:06:11.087 --> 00:06:12.261
I like you.

00:06:13.657 --> 00:06:16.172
Okay.

00:06:51.056 --> 00:06:52.902
Hae Won, this is Hwi.

00:06:53.166 --> 00:06:55.212
Do you have time today?

00:06:56.796 --> 00:06:58.412
Hey, Hae Won.

00:06:59.036 --> 00:07:02.036
Hae Won, go sweep the garden if you're up!

00:07:02.036 --> 00:07:03.507
There is still a lot of stuff left in the garden...

00:07:03.507 --> 00:07:05.951
so we have to sweep the whole place clean.

00:07:06.147 --> 00:07:07.606
It would be good for exercise.

00:07:07.606 --> 00:07:09.152
You should do it...

00:07:16.717 --> 00:07:18.532
Have a sip of this, Hae Won.

00:07:27.166 --> 00:07:30.871
Hae Won, you should consider yourself really lucky.

00:07:32.606 --> 00:07:33.681
I should?

00:07:35.036 --> 00:07:36.707
You know, getting rejected by Eun Seop.

00:07:36.707 --> 00:07:38.621
I saw everything.

00:07:40.147 --> 00:07:41.222
So?

00:07:42.046 --> 00:07:44.986
I must say, I'm kind of an expert...

00:07:44.986 --> 00:07:47.691
at asking guys out and getting rejected.

00:07:47.786 --> 00:07:49.986
What should I say? I have a certain know-how...

00:07:49.986 --> 00:07:52.902
and a method to cope with this type of situation.

00:07:53.957 --> 00:07:55.332
You have know-how?

00:07:59.226 --> 00:08:02.337
Hae Won, when people usually get rejected...

00:08:02.337 --> 00:08:04.296
by someone they like,

00:08:04.296 --> 00:08:06.342
something like this crosses their minds.

00:08:09.476 --> 00:08:11.582
What on earth did I do wrong?

00:08:11.707 --> 00:08:15.022
No. You did nothing wrong.

00:08:17.746 --> 00:08:18.991
Do you think so?

00:08:19.347 --> 00:08:20.486
Of course not.

00:08:20.486 --> 00:08:22.486
What did you do wrong?

00:08:22.486 --> 00:08:25.226
Telling him how you feel about him. What's wrong with that?

00:08:25.226 --> 00:08:26.726
It's not our fault.

00:08:26.726 --> 00:08:29.597
Fine, let's say it's our fault then.

00:08:29.597 --> 00:08:31.397
Even if we fix what we did wrong...

00:08:31.397 --> 00:08:33.697
and go back to the people whom we liked,

00:08:33.697 --> 00:08:35.865
can you guarantee they will like us back?

00:08:35.866 --> 00:08:39.307
No! Even if I become the most beautiful girl in the world,

00:08:39.307 --> 00:08:40.981
Kim Young Soo won't like me.

00:08:43.006 --> 00:08:44.906
- Is that so? - Of course.

00:08:44.906 --> 00:08:46.177
Those who reject you once...

00:08:46.177 --> 00:08:48.476
have a tendency never to look back.

00:08:48.476 --> 00:08:50.116
Hence, is that our fault...

00:08:50.116 --> 00:08:51.687
or their fault?

00:08:51.687 --> 00:08:53.217
It's their fault!

00:08:53.217 --> 00:08:55.591
- So, we did... - Nothing wrong.

00:08:56.687 --> 00:08:57.762
Bingo.

00:08:58.256 --> 00:08:59.902
Good, now we're talking.

00:09:03.496 --> 00:09:04.672
All right.

00:09:04.827 --> 00:09:06.496
Forget about your damaged self-esteem.

00:09:06.496 --> 00:09:10.272
Put it aside for now.

00:09:10.297 --> 00:09:13.711
Let's just enjoy this yogurt. Cheers.

00:09:14.807 --> 00:09:16.152
Mok Hae Won!

00:09:18.547 --> 00:09:19.782
Get in.

00:09:22.947 --> 00:09:24.787
- Hello, did you have lunch? - Yes, I did.

00:09:24.787 --> 00:09:27.116
- We can just send this over, right? - Yes.

00:09:27.116 --> 00:09:29.662
- Did you get the approval? - Yes, it's all good to go.

00:09:34.626 --> 00:09:36.126
Gosh, Jang Woo.

00:09:36.126 --> 00:09:38.967
I guess you kidnapped us because you needed our help with this.

00:09:38.967 --> 00:09:41.197
Yes, Ji Yeon. I'll take you out for a steak dinner.

00:09:41.197 --> 00:09:42.872
You can eat as much as you want.

00:09:42.896 --> 00:09:45.207
Do we have to take down all the tents?

00:09:45.207 --> 00:09:47.937
No, just take down the frames inside.

00:09:47.937 --> 00:09:50.376
Jang Woo, wouldn't you need more people...

00:09:50.376 --> 00:09:51.551
Yes, we need more people.

00:09:52.776 --> 00:09:56.417
Then shall I call some friends?

00:09:56.417 --> 00:09:57.516
Yes, you should.

00:09:57.516 --> 00:10:00.287
Ideally, one of your close friends. And if possible,

00:10:00.287 --> 00:10:01.986
one of those beautiful ladies...

00:10:01.986 --> 00:10:04.417
who took time off work and came all the way here for the reunion...

00:10:04.417 --> 00:10:06.726
Oh, I see.

00:10:06.726 --> 00:10:07.927
Point taken.

00:10:07.927 --> 00:10:10.471
- You two should head inside first. - Yes, ma'am.

00:10:11.567 --> 00:10:13.226
What do you want to eat? Beef?

00:10:13.226 --> 00:10:16.742
Tenderloin? Sirloin? Chuck flap tail? Hanging tender?

00:10:18.537 --> 00:10:21.242
Hey. You haven't left for Gangneung yet, right?

00:10:22.906 --> 00:10:24.112
Come out.

00:10:34.646 --> 00:10:37.156
Eun Seop! Lim Eun Seop!

00:10:37.156 --> 00:10:38.961
Where are you, Eun Seop?

00:10:39.486 --> 00:10:42.201
Hey, Mr. Popular!

00:10:42.996 --> 00:10:44.756
Let's get this done.

00:10:44.756 --> 00:10:45.827
Hi!

00:10:45.827 --> 00:10:46.902
Hello.

00:10:47.496 --> 00:10:49.571
Jang Woo, you probably know the reason.

00:10:49.697 --> 00:10:50.841
Reason for what?

00:10:50.937 --> 00:10:53.782
Why didn't Eun Seop didn't have his graduation photo taken?

00:10:55.837 --> 00:10:57.681
Oh, back then...

00:10:59.307 --> 00:11:01.376
- Park Sang Won. - Here.

00:11:01.376 --> 00:11:02.947
- Kang In Han. - Here.

00:11:02.947 --> 00:11:04.252
Lim Eun Seop.

00:11:04.776 --> 00:11:05.892
Lim Eun Seop?

00:11:07.587 --> 00:11:09.591
- Eun Seop isn't here again? - No.

00:11:09.986 --> 00:11:11.591
Hey, you.

00:11:12.327 --> 00:11:14.601
Be quiet, will you?

00:11:15.297 --> 00:11:16.827
- Park Jung Hee. - Here.

00:11:16.827 --> 00:11:19.496
Eun Seop missed school often back then.

00:11:19.496 --> 00:11:20.642
Why?

00:11:21.467 --> 00:11:22.642
Not sure.

00:11:22.766 --> 00:11:26.406
Actually, I never saw him in town for about three years after that.

00:11:26.406 --> 00:11:27.811
That guy next door...

00:11:28.406 --> 00:11:30.412
He's like a different person.

00:11:30.906 --> 00:11:32.681
- Like a different person? - Yes.

00:11:33.006 --> 00:11:36.376
As if he went missing for a while and came back.

00:11:36.376 --> 00:11:39.461
That reminds me,

00:11:39.687 --> 00:11:42.662
- I didn't see him around for years. - See?

00:11:43.287 --> 00:11:45.726
Then he came back, served in the military,

00:11:45.726 --> 00:11:47.026
and opened the bookstore.

00:11:47.026 --> 00:11:49.331
You don't know why he suddenly packed up and left?

00:11:50.226 --> 00:11:51.772
No, I don't.

00:11:51.797 --> 00:11:53.327
The truth is,

00:11:53.327 --> 00:11:56.136
we are close friends, but I don't know much about him.

00:11:56.136 --> 00:11:59.382
Things like what he likes and wants and what his dreams are...

00:11:59.406 --> 00:12:00.437
I don't know those things.

00:12:00.437 --> 00:12:02.782
Right, a long time ago...

00:12:05.146 --> 00:12:07.181
Nothing's precious to me.

00:12:07.746 --> 00:12:09.292
What did you say?

00:12:10.476 --> 00:12:11.622
Nothing is...

00:12:12.746 --> 00:12:14.622
precious to me.

00:12:14.646 --> 00:12:16.662
You can't think of anything that's precious to you?

00:12:16.986 --> 00:12:18.662
Not even one thing?

00:12:20.187 --> 00:12:21.331
That's right.

00:12:21.587 --> 00:12:24.331
Gosh, that punk. Sit down!

00:12:26.626 --> 00:12:28.242
Is Jung Hee here today?

00:12:28.636 --> 00:12:31.612
- Where's Jung Hee? - I just thought he was quirky.

00:12:32.866 --> 00:12:35.581
"He's different from other people."

00:12:41.817 --> 00:12:43.652
Nothing's precious to him?

00:12:44.246 --> 00:12:46.292
I guess that's true.

00:12:46.486 --> 00:12:48.992
He's never concerned even when he loses stuff.

00:12:49.256 --> 00:12:51.831
Oh, there's something he's very attached to. The key chain.

00:12:52.087 --> 00:12:54.931
You know, the thing in his car.

00:13:01.297 --> 00:13:04.071
Once, he lost it.

00:13:04.097 --> 00:13:06.807
Eun Seop, can you tell me what you're looking for...

00:13:06.807 --> 00:13:09.051
so that I can help you find it?

00:13:09.606 --> 00:13:10.752
Gosh.

00:13:15.047 --> 00:13:16.892
Gosh, that lunatic.

00:13:17.746 --> 00:13:20.162
Eun Seop, let's go. I don't think it's here.

00:13:20.287 --> 00:13:21.561
I'm leaving!

00:13:21.917 --> 00:13:23.917
He ran around like a crazy person trying to find it.

00:13:23.917 --> 00:13:25.756
I'm really leaving. Come on.

00:13:25.756 --> 00:13:27.632
- Hey! - Hey.

00:13:41.837 --> 00:13:44.412
Don't you remember? He used to bring it to school every day.

00:13:45.577 --> 00:13:47.681
How would I know?

00:13:51.817 --> 00:13:52.992
What does it look like?

00:13:53.016 --> 00:13:54.486
A doll?

00:13:54.486 --> 00:13:58.262
No, he made it in the metalworks class.

00:13:58.317 --> 00:14:00.601
- Metalworks? - Yes.

00:14:11.136 --> 00:14:13.612
You'll give it to the classmate you'll be sitting with.

00:14:16.177 --> 00:14:18.447
It took no time because three of us did it together.

00:14:18.447 --> 00:14:20.947
Now that this is done, let's go to the cafeteria and...

00:14:20.947 --> 00:14:23.417
Excuse me? You said you just needed us to take down the frames.

00:14:23.417 --> 00:14:25.486
There's a ton of food supplies left there.

00:14:25.486 --> 00:14:27.947
- Hey, do you want to fight? - Guys, I have to go.

00:14:27.947 --> 00:14:29.356
- What? Where's Hae Won going? - What?

00:14:29.356 --> 00:14:30.756
- Bye, see you. - Hae Won, where are you going?

00:14:30.756 --> 00:14:32.356
- Hae Won. - Hae Won. Oh...

00:14:32.356 --> 00:14:33.587
Eun Sil is here. Hi, Eun Sil.

00:14:33.587 --> 00:14:35.297
- Jang Woo, you're here too. - Yes.

00:14:35.297 --> 00:14:36.327
I'm here.

00:14:36.327 --> 00:14:38.725
I have to go. There's a ton of food supplies left in the cafeteria.

00:14:38.726 --> 00:14:41.797
Just take care of that. I'm busy, so I have to go. Bye!

00:14:41.797 --> 00:14:43.337
- Hey! - Hey, where are you going?

00:14:43.337 --> 00:14:44.567
What's with him?

00:14:44.567 --> 00:14:47.581
Gosh. Why did he want me to call you, then?

00:14:47.707 --> 00:14:48.811
Me?

00:14:49.606 --> 00:14:50.951
I think...

00:14:51.307 --> 00:14:54.782
he has a crush on you but is scared at the same time.

00:14:54.947 --> 00:14:56.091
Gosh.

00:14:57.276 --> 00:15:00.262
Come with me. I have to go to the cafeteria to do some work.

00:15:00.417 --> 00:15:02.762
- Why should I? - You're here anyway.

00:15:21.667 --> 00:15:25.051
Your mom wants you to stop sending her letters.

00:15:39.557 --> 00:15:40.701
Don't work so hard on it.

00:15:40.827 --> 00:15:44.532
You'll give it to the classmate you'll be sitting with.

00:15:44.827 --> 00:15:45.971
What?

00:15:46.697 --> 00:15:48.071
You didn't know, right?

00:15:52.006 --> 00:15:54.006
- Hey. - Give it back!

00:15:54.006 --> 00:15:56.081
- You'd better give it back! - Then who will I give it to?

00:15:56.876 --> 00:15:57.951
What?

00:15:58.406 --> 00:16:03.317
(Mok Hae Won)

00:16:03.317 --> 00:16:04.522
I'm not sure.

00:16:06.547 --> 00:16:08.221
Wouldn't it be Lim Eun Seop?

00:16:27.106 --> 00:16:28.382
Lim Eun Seop.

00:16:31.437 --> 00:16:34.476
I made this in the metalworks class.

00:16:34.476 --> 00:16:36.292
I'm supposed to give this to you.

00:16:55.026 --> 00:16:56.112
Sorry.

00:16:57.636 --> 00:17:00.042
- Oh, wait. - I'll get it.

00:17:06.376 --> 00:17:08.052
- Eun Seop. - Yes.

00:17:08.747 --> 00:17:11.191
You said Irene is Hwi, right?

00:17:11.416 --> 00:17:12.562
Yes.

00:17:12.847 --> 00:17:14.922
- Well... - I don't buy that.

00:17:14.946 --> 00:17:17.716
It sounded like you were talking to your girlfriend.

00:17:17.716 --> 00:17:19.057
Right? That's because...

00:17:19.057 --> 00:17:20.126
I bet it's not Hwi.

00:17:20.126 --> 00:17:21.931
Come on.

I like you, Eun Seop.

(Good Night Bookstore)

00:18:23.656 --> 00:18:24.761
Hey.

00:18:24.886 --> 00:18:26.456
You're not working today, right?

00:18:26.456 --> 00:18:29.072
I remembered something.

00:18:31.126 --> 00:18:32.372
Well...

00:18:32.727 --> 00:18:35.172
That key chain in your car.

00:18:36.767 --> 00:18:37.872
Is it...

00:18:38.636 --> 00:18:40.912
the one I gave you?

00:18:41.767 --> 00:18:45.251
You know, the metalworks class back in 12th grade.

00:18:45.277 --> 00:18:48.606
We made key chains and exchanged them.

00:18:48.606 --> 00:18:51.721
I was just wondering if it's the one I gave you back then.

00:18:52.817 --> 00:18:55.487
I didn't know because of the engraved letters, but...

00:18:55.487 --> 00:18:57.291
No, it's not that one.

00:18:57.557 --> 00:18:58.662
What?

00:19:01.027 --> 00:19:02.471
It's not the one you gave me.

00:19:04.426 --> 00:19:07.166
Back then, I sat next to you,

00:19:07.166 --> 00:19:09.572
- and I clearly remember... - You're right.

00:19:12.267 --> 00:19:13.842
But I never gave mine to you.

00:19:16.777 --> 00:19:18.882
- No, you didn't. - It's that.

00:19:21.446 --> 00:19:23.977
Are you saying that thing in your car...

00:19:23.977 --> 00:19:25.491
Yes.

00:19:26.646 --> 00:19:29.491
It's what I made...

00:19:29.557 --> 00:19:31.632
and never gave to you.

00:19:32.987 --> 00:19:34.102
I see.

00:19:36.097 --> 00:19:37.872
All right.

Yes, sure.

Yes.

Can you help me?

Gosh, it's too heavy.

Fine, I'll be right there. Hang up.

The manager is treating us to dinner...

00:22:13.817 --> 00:22:15.247
to celebrate the success of the event.

00:22:15.247 --> 00:22:17.287
Well, I can't come.

00:22:28.597 --> 00:22:31.537
where are your friends from earlier?

00:22:31.537 --> 00:22:33.136
- They're so pretty. - Pardon?

00:22:33.136 --> 00:22:34.466
Bring them with you.

00:22:34.466 --> 00:22:37.406
They worked so hard today. I'd love to pour them a drink.

- I don't think so. - What?

00:22:39.547 --> 00:22:42.676
I don't like sashimi.

- You don't like sashimi? - No.

I saw you eating sausages yesterday.

Since this morning.

00:23:04.767 --> 00:23:05.941
Oh, my.

00:23:06.567 --> 00:23:08.706
Look at the color of the meat.

00:23:08.706 --> 00:23:10.807
Doesn't it look fresh? Eat up.

00:23:10.807 --> 00:23:12.136
Is this...

00:23:12.136 --> 00:23:14.047
- It's chuck flap tail. - Oh, right.

00:23:14.047 --> 00:23:15.646
This looks so tasty too.

00:23:15.646 --> 00:23:17.322
- It's beef tenderloin. - Beef tenderloin.

00:23:23.216 --> 00:23:24.832
That's sirloin.

00:23:25.757 --> 00:23:28.201
I see you brought some thick skirt?

00:23:28.686 --> 00:23:30.956
I asked you to choose among tenderloin, sirloin,

00:23:30.956 --> 00:23:32.426
chuck flap tail, and thick skirt.

00:23:32.426 --> 00:23:35.097
How could you eat all four of them?

00:23:35.097 --> 00:23:37.172
It's delicious. Try it, Jang Woo.

00:23:37.567 --> 00:23:39.366
I don't have much of an appetite.

00:23:39.366 --> 00:23:40.466
You don't have much of an appetite?

00:23:40.466 --> 00:23:41.541
Just eat it.

00:23:47.206 --> 00:23:48.981
Jang Woo, don't you have a girlfriend?

00:23:50.247 --> 00:23:51.322
What?

00:23:52.386 --> 00:23:54.787
Me? No, I don't.

00:23:54.787 --> 00:23:56.931
But you did have a girlfriend for a while.

00:23:57.317 --> 00:23:58.991
For a couple of years, right?

00:23:59.886 --> 00:24:03.297
What about that supermarket girl called Jeong Hyeon A?

00:24:03.297 --> 00:24:04.626
I thought you guys were getting close.

00:24:04.626 --> 00:24:06.771
- No, we weren't. - Really?

00:24:06.997 --> 00:24:08.102
I was so sure.

00:24:08.866 --> 00:24:12.537
When are you going back, by the way?

00:24:12.537 --> 00:24:14.166
I don't want to go back at all.

00:24:14.166 --> 00:24:16.011
I hate having to go back to work!

00:24:16.936 --> 00:24:19.277
Gosh, you work in the Gangneung city hall.

00:24:19.277 --> 00:24:20.977
You complain too much.

00:24:20.977 --> 00:24:22.946
Consider yourself lucky and work hard.

00:24:22.946 --> 00:24:23.977
Stop taking days off...

00:24:23.977 --> 00:24:26.761
just to wander around this town.

00:24:28.146 --> 00:24:30.057
That reminds me.

00:24:30.057 --> 00:24:31.616
There's a project I'm planning right now.

00:24:31.616 --> 00:24:33.487
It's called wandering routes.

00:24:33.487 --> 00:24:35.587
In the City of Hyecheon, we'll create something...

00:24:35.587 --> 00:24:36.696
- like the Jeju Olle Trail... - Hey.

00:24:36.696 --> 00:24:37.926
Cut it out.

00:24:37.926 --> 00:24:40.067
You'd been complaining about how busy you were...

00:24:40.067 --> 00:24:42.666
with the Joint Reunion preparation until a few days ago.

00:24:42.666 --> 00:24:44.666
And it's finally over, you idiot.

00:24:44.666 --> 00:24:46.737
Jang Woo, you must be a workaholic.

00:24:46.737 --> 00:24:48.507
Do you love work so much?

00:24:48.507 --> 00:24:50.011
Yes, I do.

00:24:50.807 --> 00:24:52.382
I think it's super fun.

00:24:52.577 --> 00:24:54.382
To see people enjoy...

00:24:54.676 --> 00:24:56.451
what I've only imagined.

00:25:02.317 --> 00:25:03.656
Excuse me!

00:25:03.656 --> 00:25:06.385
- One portion of thin flank, please! - Sure.

00:25:06.386 --> 00:25:09.056
Hey, they don't bring the meat to the table here. Get it yourself.

00:25:09.057 --> 00:25:12.132
You two really can eat a lot.

"Traveling After a Breakup".

00:25:49.136 --> 00:25:51.337
I went to Sandeul Bookstore to buy that book,

00:25:51.337 --> 00:25:53.441
but Mr. Park told me...

00:25:53.737 --> 00:25:55.441
you already bought that book.

00:25:55.936 --> 00:25:58.477
Yes, I did. You mean the one from the independent publisher, right?

00:25:58.477 --> 00:26:01.622
Yes, I'd love to buy that book.

00:26:02.616 --> 00:26:04.577
I think it costs around 18 dollars.

00:26:04.577 --> 00:26:06.386
I'll check and let you know.

00:26:06.386 --> 00:26:07.987
If you text me your address, I'll send it to...

00:26:07.987 --> 00:26:09.062
No.

00:26:10.616 --> 00:26:13.062
I'd love to come and have a look before buying it.

00:26:14.656 --> 00:26:17.531
Will your bookstore be open this weekend?

00:26:18.757 --> 00:26:20.271
Yes, it will be.

00:26:22.126 --> 00:26:25.441
Then I'll stop by this Sunday evening.

00:26:25.597 --> 00:26:26.812
Can I do that?

00:26:28.936 --> 00:26:30.951
Sure, you can do that.

00:26:32.037 --> 00:26:33.152
See you then.

00:26:34.577 --> 00:26:35.721
One more thing, Eun Seop.

00:26:36.577 --> 00:26:39.491
Well, I'm wondering...

00:26:41.116 --> 00:26:43.562
if Hae Won works there on weekends too.

00:26:45.186 --> 00:26:46.701
No, she doesn't.

00:26:47.426 --> 00:26:50.231
Right. That's a relief.

00:26:51.126 --> 00:26:53.701
She hates me so much.

00:26:54.267 --> 00:26:56.971
I was worried things would get awkward.

00:26:58.097 --> 00:26:59.172
I see.

00:27:00.666 --> 00:27:01.882

I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

Don't worry.

00:27:34.767 --> 00:27:36.436
Is it because there's only one?

00:27:36.436 --> 00:27:38.451
They put so much care into this book.

00:27:39.406 --> 00:27:41.622

Can you tell me more about this book?

00:28:03.567 --> 00:28:04.741
Well...

00:28:06.966 --> 00:28:09.211
A couple goes on a trip after they break up.

00:28:10.577 --> 00:28:12.747
While they were still together,

00:28:12.747 --> 00:28:15.622
they saved up some money to go on a trip together someday.

00:28:15.946 --> 00:28:17.592
They go on a trip after they break up?

00:28:17.876 --> 00:28:18.951
Together?

00:28:19.017 --> 00:28:20.322
No, separately.

00:28:20.646 --> 00:28:21.847

00:28:21.847 --> 00:28:24.191

Then shall we use this as the introduction on the website?

- Hae Won. - Yes?

Excuse me.

Stop.

00:31:17.769 --> 00:31:19.943
Why have you suddenly stopped liking me?

00:31:20.099 --> 00:31:22.668
Well, it's a bit complicated. So simply put,

00:31:22.668 --> 00:31:25.884
you should consider it as a matter of pride.

00:31:26.478 --> 00:31:28.478
- Okay. - Why?

00:31:28.478 --> 00:31:30.809
Are you disappointed to find out...

00:31:30.809 --> 00:31:32.824
that I don't like you anymore?

No.

Why do you raise a dog?

What?

Don't you know how sad our family was after Hodu died?

How could you raise another dog?

00:35:15.199 --> 00:35:17.414
But that's Hodu's son.

00:35:17.708 --> 00:35:20.239
So what? Do you have to raise it if it's a son?

00:35:20.239 --> 00:35:22.679
My mom didn't even raise me. Is a son that important?

00:35:22.679 --> 00:35:26.024

Why is his name Gunbam?

00:35:30.418 --> 00:35:31.719
I bet even he hates his own name.

Whether he's divorced or not has nothing to do with me.

00:39:33.859 --> 00:39:35.533
Why did it get canceled though?

00:39:36.259 --> 00:39:37.774
Eun Seop isn't feeling well.

00:39:37.869 --> 00:39:39.903
What? He's not feeling well?

00:39:40.369 --> 00:39:43.513
Well, I heard he has a bad cold.

00:39:44.609 --> 00:39:45.883
Gosh.

00:39:51.449 --> 00:39:52.524
Darn it!

00:39:53.348 --> 00:39:54.423
"Darn it"?

00:39:56.078 --> 00:39:57.164
What...

00:39:58.018 --> 00:40:00.064
Goodness.

00:40:38.728 --> 00:40:40.633
Mom! Dad!

00:40:40.699 --> 00:40:42.173
Mom! Dad!

00:40:42.529 --> 00:40:44.104
Mom, where are you?

00:40:56.308 --> 00:40:57.383
Come on out.

00:41:00.819 --> 00:41:02.578
Mom, is he very ill?

00:41:02.578 --> 00:41:04.894
What's wrong with him? Did something happen?

00:41:05.688 --> 00:41:07.064
I have no idea.

00:41:08.159 --> 00:41:10.228
He didn't say anything to me until he was that sick.

00:41:10.228 --> 00:41:12.863
- Gosh, that crazy fool. - Crazy fool.

00:41:13.498 --> 00:41:15.699
Mom, are you concocting herbal medicine...

00:41:15.699 --> 00:41:17.098
for Eun Seop right now?

00:41:17.098 --> 00:41:18.728
What else can I do?

00:41:18.728 --> 00:41:21.343
He won't go to the hospital or take regular medicine.

00:41:21.538 --> 00:41:24.139
He listens to me regarding everything else,

00:41:24.139 --> 00:41:26.168
so I don't know why he always refuses to take medicine.

00:41:26.168 --> 00:41:28.308
It's just like how Dad always refuses to ask for directions...

00:41:28.308 --> 00:41:29.578
when he's going somewhere...

00:41:29.578 --> 00:41:31.878
where he's not familiar with.

00:41:31.878 --> 00:41:34.219
Also, you totally ignored me when I asked you to make me...

00:41:34.219 --> 00:41:35.378
the medicinal tea to help me study.

00:41:35.378 --> 00:41:36.518
But for Eun Seop...

00:41:36.518 --> 00:41:38.119
You two are different.

00:41:38.119 --> 00:41:39.619
What do you mean? We're both your children!

00:41:39.619 --> 00:41:43.018
Oh, boy. My dear wife and daughter, I'm home.

00:41:43.018 --> 00:41:44.128
I'll tell Dad on you.

00:41:44.128 --> 00:41:48.159
- You can't leave your bike outside. - Sure, tell him all you want.

00:41:48.159 --> 00:41:50.628
Dad! Mom keeps scolding me.

00:41:50.628 --> 00:41:52.429
Why? What's the problem now?

00:41:52.429 --> 00:41:53.644
Go inside.

00:41:55.498 --> 00:41:57.109
Mom only cares about Eun Seop.

00:41:57.109 --> 00:41:58.768
Gosh, my feelings are so hurt.

00:41:58.768 --> 00:42:00.378
- I want to move out soon. - What's going on?

00:42:00.378 --> 00:42:01.754
Did something happen?

00:42:03.409 --> 00:42:05.754
She seems really upset.

00:42:08.378 --> 00:42:09.624
I'm just...

00:42:11.248 --> 00:42:13.194
reminded of that time.

00:42:16.688 --> 00:42:19.464
The time when Eun Seop disappeared for a while...

00:42:20.228 --> 00:42:22.403
and came back.

00:42:25.969 --> 00:42:28.469
He refused to take medicine...

00:42:28.469 --> 00:42:30.843
or see a doctor.

00:42:32.438 --> 00:42:33.953
That's exactly what he's doing now.

00:42:39.609 --> 00:42:40.823
Back then,

00:42:41.018 --> 00:42:43.524
I thought we'd lose him.

00:42:45.319 --> 00:42:47.664
Don't try so hard.

00:42:48.619 --> 00:42:51.104
He'll never say...

00:42:51.558 --> 00:42:53.903
what you want to hear.

00:42:57.429 --> 00:42:59.144
He won't.

00:42:59.598 --> 00:43:01.843
He keeps everything to himself, you know.

00:43:03.969 --> 00:43:05.644
He doesn't need to say it.

00:43:06.739 --> 00:43:07.978
But you wanted to hear it.

00:43:07.978 --> 00:43:09.409
No, I don't.

00:43:09.409 --> 00:43:11.184
And I don't need to hear it.

00:43:14.848 --> 00:43:17.194
Well, all right. Forget it, then.

00:43:20.889 --> 00:43:23.759
A million roses

00:43:23.759 --> 00:43:25.303
Gosh, stop it.

00:43:25.788 --> 00:43:28.628
I will give them to you

00:43:28.628 --> 00:43:30.234
Gosh, it's so cold!

00:43:56.219 --> 00:43:57.303
Hey.

00:43:57.828 --> 00:43:59.334
You don't have to work today?

00:44:00.799 --> 00:44:02.104
No, I don't.

00:44:04.768 --> 00:44:06.044
How does it taste?

00:44:07.199 --> 00:44:08.274
What?

00:44:10.308 --> 00:44:11.668
I cooked for the first time in a while,

00:44:11.668 --> 00:44:13.283
so I just wasn't sure.

00:44:14.409 --> 00:44:15.484
I don't know.

00:44:18.878 --> 00:44:20.024
Well, it's good.

00:44:25.418 --> 00:44:26.493
What?

00:44:27.719 --> 00:44:29.263
You see...

00:44:30.688 --> 00:44:33.259
I want to ask you something because I'm really curious.

00:44:33.259 --> 00:44:34.573
Will you answer my question?

00:44:35.359 --> 00:44:36.434
Sure, fire away.

00:44:38.898 --> 00:44:40.573
Are you not feeling well or something?

00:44:46.668 --> 00:44:47.914
No, I'm fine.

00:44:58.589 --> 00:45:00.493
(Peaceful, Prosperous Gangwon)

00:45:05.288 --> 00:45:07.604
(Department of Culture, Sports, and Tourism)

00:45:09.728 --> 00:45:12.469
I'll go over it again at our next meeting.

00:45:12.469 --> 00:45:14.069
- Okay, well done. - Thank you.

00:45:14.069 --> 00:45:16.013
- Keep up the great work. - Will do.

00:45:30.949 --> 00:45:32.119
Ji Yeon went to see her in-laws.

00:45:32.119 --> 00:45:33.449
That's why I'm here to drop these off.

00:45:33.449 --> 00:45:35.533
You have to memorize everything, okay?

00:45:35.859 --> 00:45:38.989
These here are cucumber salad and seasoned dried pollack.

00:45:38.989 --> 00:45:40.228
They're for you.

00:45:40.228 --> 00:45:42.598
And these are seasoned spinach and bracken fern.

00:45:42.598 --> 00:45:43.768
They're for Ji Yeon.

00:45:43.768 --> 00:45:45.098
This pile here is for Hae Won.

00:45:45.098 --> 00:45:47.774
It's mustard green kimchi and... What was the other one?

00:45:47.969 --> 00:45:49.044
I don't remember.

00:45:49.139 --> 00:45:51.268
These are for So Min. She's getting three.

00:45:51.268 --> 00:45:53.878
These are all for Jung Hee. These four from here to here.

00:45:53.878 --> 00:45:56.584
And these are for Eun Seop. This, this, and this.

00:45:59.578 --> 00:46:00.854
Are you listening?

00:46:01.279 --> 00:46:02.553
Do you remember everything?

00:46:04.049 --> 00:46:05.124
Yes.

00:46:07.288 --> 00:46:09.458
The cucumber salad and seasoned dried pollack are mine.

00:46:09.458 --> 00:46:12.889
The spinach and bracken fern are for Ji Yeon's family.

00:46:12.889 --> 00:46:15.699
The mustard green kimchi and the other thing are for Hae Won.

00:46:15.699 --> 00:46:18.504
These 3 here are for So Min, and these 4 are for Jung Hee.

00:46:18.699 --> 00:46:20.073
And these three here...

00:46:21.398 --> 00:46:22.538
are for Eun Seop's family.

00:46:22.538 --> 00:46:25.008
Wow. I guess you didn't cheat your way into...

00:46:25.009 --> 00:46:26.144
Seoul National University after all.

00:46:26.569 --> 00:46:29.214
All right. Anyway, make sure everyone gets these.

00:46:29.339 --> 00:46:31.509
I'll get going. Sorry to bother you at work.

00:46:31.509 --> 00:46:33.024
Put them in here.

00:46:33.049 --> 00:46:34.124
Here you go.

00:46:35.248 --> 00:46:37.464
By the way, is there a space to store this?

00:46:37.819 --> 00:46:40.958
I'm done for the day, so I can just take it now.

00:46:40.958 --> 00:46:42.234
Why are you leaving already?

00:46:42.418 --> 00:46:43.859
I'm taking the afternoon off.

00:46:43.859 --> 00:46:46.363
Why? Are you not feeling well either?

00:46:50.058 --> 00:46:51.944
You don't look sick.

00:46:52.998 --> 00:46:55.113
I'm not sick. I'm fine,

00:46:55.438 --> 00:46:56.869
but I want to go home and get some rest.

00:46:56.869 --> 00:46:59.743
I see. Be careful not to catch a cold.

00:46:59.969 --> 00:47:01.978
I heard Eun Seop is very sick with a bad cold.

00:47:01.978 --> 00:47:03.779
Everyone's talking about it.

00:47:03.779 --> 00:47:05.223
Oh, Eun Seop is sick?

00:47:05.578 --> 00:47:06.848
Anyway, all right. Bye.

00:47:06.848 --> 00:47:08.223
Oh, right. Jang Woo.

00:47:08.378 --> 00:47:09.493
Yes? What?

00:47:10.449 --> 00:47:12.263
What did we eat yesterday?

00:47:14.518 --> 00:47:16.389
Thin flank and chuck flap tail.

00:47:16.389 --> 00:47:18.128
Yes, that's right.

00:47:18.128 --> 00:47:20.498
If you tell anyone again that I had a crush on you...

00:47:20.498 --> 00:47:22.029
and spread false rumors,

00:47:22.029 --> 00:47:24.874
your chuck flap tail and thin flank...

00:47:25.299 --> 00:47:26.573
had better watch out.

00:47:27.098 --> 00:47:29.044
I'm off. Bye!

00:47:30.438 --> 00:47:31.584
All right, bye.

00:47:43.179 --> 00:47:44.723
Gosh, she's scary.

00:47:45.348 --> 00:47:46.723
That was so scary.

00:48:41.179 --> 00:48:42.754
Jin Ho.

00:49:34.659 --> 00:49:36.628
Ms. Yun, I'm here.

00:49:36.628 --> 00:49:38.628
Hi, Jang Woo.

00:49:38.628 --> 00:49:41.299
I brought some side dishes from Eun Sil's store.

00:49:41.299 --> 00:49:43.598
- She called me. - She did?

00:49:43.598 --> 00:49:45.314
- Yes. - All right.

00:49:45.639 --> 00:49:50.279
Can you set Eun Seop up with one of your colleagues?

00:49:50.279 --> 00:49:53.748
Eun Seop is not interested in dating anyone.

00:49:53.748 --> 00:49:56.119
Eun Seop, Jang Woo is here!

00:49:56.119 --> 00:49:57.363
Eun Seop!

00:50:01.389 --> 00:50:04.464
Why isn't he answering? Eun Seop!

00:50:11.828 --> 00:50:14.173
Ms. Yun, Eun Seop is not here.

00:50:20.376 --> 00:50:21.851
Eun Seop!

00:50:24.075 --> 00:50:25.646
Are you in there?

(Good Night Bookstore)

00:50:29.090 --> 00:50:30.435
Eun Seop!

00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:34.035
Eun Seop!

00:50:35.130 --> 00:50:37.006
Is Eun Seop in there?

00:50:38.601 --> 00:50:41.645
Oh, Hae Won. Well...

00:50:43.501 --> 00:50:45.986
It doesn't seem like it, does it?

00:50:46.170 --> 00:50:47.316
Okay.

00:50:50.110 --> 00:50:53.026
- He disappeared? - Yes, all of a sudden.

00:50:54.021 --> 00:50:56.026
Have you seen him today?

00:50:56.420 --> 00:50:57.590
No, I haven't.

00:50:57.590 --> 00:51:00.066
Where could he be?

00:51:02.221 --> 00:51:03.796
I heard he's sick.

00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:05.406
Yes, he is.

00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:07.506
He's rarely sick.

00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:09.776
And he disappeared?

00:51:10.670 --> 00:51:12.800
I know. I wonder where he went.

00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:15.201
- Have you tried calling him? - No.

00:51:15.201 --> 00:51:17.046
It seems like he left his phone at home.

00:51:18.411 --> 00:51:20.415
Is he in the mountains or something?

00:51:30.451 --> 00:51:33.550
I invited all my friends, and I told my mom...

(Park Hin Dol, Sandeul Bookstore)

00:51:35.820 --> 00:51:38.230
- For hours... - By yourself?

00:51:38.230 --> 00:51:39.931
Oh, hello.

00:51:39.931 --> 00:51:43.161
How are you, Mr. Park?

00:51:43.161 --> 00:51:47.776
Is Eun Seop at your bookstore by any chance?

00:51:49.371 --> 00:51:50.915
I see.

00:51:51.110 --> 00:51:54.141
Okay. Bye.

00:51:54.141 --> 00:51:56.911
Seriously, there are...

(Eun Seop's friends)

00:51:58.411 --> 00:52:01.526
Mom, he's definitely in the mountains.

00:52:01.780 --> 00:52:02.851
What if he isn't?

00:52:02.851 --> 00:52:05.550
He is. I'm 100 percent sure.

00:52:05.550 --> 00:52:08.420
Every time he disappears and gets out of reach,

00:52:08.420 --> 00:52:10.360
where does he go?

00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:11.935
To the mountains.

Hi, Ji Yeon.

It's Eun Seop's mom.

00:52:17.331 --> 00:52:21.915
I'm wondering if you've seen Eun Seop today.

00:52:23.601 --> 00:52:25.641
Oh, you're at your in-laws' place?

00:52:25.641 --> 00:52:27.541
My goodness.

00:52:27.541 --> 00:52:29.681
If you see him,

00:52:29.681 --> 00:52:32.650
can you give me a call?

00:52:32.650 --> 00:52:34.581
- Hello. - Who is it?

00:52:34.581 --> 00:52:36.251
- Hi! - She sounds so excited.

00:52:36.251 --> 00:52:39.725
Turn down the volume, will you?

00:52:40.991 --> 00:52:42.866
I don't know what you're worried about.

00:52:42.891 --> 00:52:45.661
Mom, you don't have to worry about him.

00:52:45.661 --> 00:52:47.661
I'm sure he feels fine now.

00:52:47.661 --> 00:52:49.530
That's why he went there.

00:52:49.530 --> 00:52:52.276
Like a sparrow who can't just pass by a mill.

00:52:52.300 --> 00:52:55.745
"Hello, I'm wondering if there's something to eat."

00:52:56.201 --> 00:52:58.886
When Dad comes home,

00:52:58.911 --> 00:53:01.181
let's go look for him in the mountains,

00:53:01.181 --> 00:53:03.280
the three of us.

00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:05.210
Why? I can't be bothered.

00:53:05.210 --> 00:53:08.280
Your brother is missing. Aren't you worried a bit about him?

00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:10.951
- He'll get back eventually. - Gosh!

00:53:10.951 --> 00:53:14.090
- I don't know what to do with you. - Mom, stop!

00:53:14.090 --> 00:53:17.061
- Let me pour you one. - What are you talking about?

00:53:17.061 --> 00:53:18.561
My goodness. Pay first.

00:53:18.561 --> 00:53:21.435
I'll pay for it later.

00:53:22.501 --> 00:53:25.745
- You're not home. - Be quiet. It's my wife.

00:53:26.971 --> 00:53:28.375
Hi.

00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:32.411
- You want to go there right now? - Come on.

00:53:32.411 --> 00:53:35.110
The village head told us to wait. We'll get in trouble.

00:53:35.110 --> 00:53:36.880
Tell her you're in the middle of something.

00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:40.251
I can't come right now.

00:53:40.251 --> 00:53:42.851
Why would you drink until you get drunk?

00:53:42.851 --> 00:53:44.991
Tell her you can't come. You have to stay.

00:53:44.991 --> 00:53:48.021
What's the point of drinking if I don't get drunk?

00:53:48.021 --> 00:53:49.960
He's missing.

00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:53.406
I can't find him anywhere or even reach him.

00:53:55.331 --> 00:53:57.576
How drunk are you?

00:53:58.730 --> 00:54:00.805
You can't even walk?

00:54:01.471 --> 00:54:05.085
Hey, I have to take a rain check on the claw machine room.

00:54:05.110 --> 00:54:06.871
Eun Seop is in the mountains again.

00:54:06.871 --> 00:54:09.285
If I go out right now, my mom will faint.

00:54:09.411 --> 00:54:12.081
Gosh, why does he have to worry us like this?

00:54:12.081 --> 00:54:14.150
You saw how high his fever was.

00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:16.756
How could you go out and drink?

00:54:18.891 --> 00:54:20.251
I'm not sure.

00:54:20.251 --> 00:54:24.035
I could really use some rest, but the manager wanted me to come in.

00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:26.435
Hello.

00:54:29.061 --> 00:54:31.546
I'll probably be stuck here for at least 2, 3 hours.

00:54:32.871 --> 00:54:36.176
Should I talk to the manager?

00:54:36.371 --> 00:54:38.486
No, that's unnecessary.

00:54:38.510 --> 00:54:40.641
Don't worry.

00:54:40.641 --> 00:54:43.085
I'm sure he's in the mountains. He'll be back soon.

00:54:43.210 --> 00:54:45.110
He can't help going to the mountains once in a while.

00:54:45.110 --> 00:54:47.521
He'll be fine. He's a grown man.

00:54:47.521 --> 00:54:49.681
Ma'am, I work in the city government.

00:54:49.681 --> 00:54:52.050
You could try calling the airport's public service center.

00:54:52.050 --> 00:54:54.820
Yes, ma'am. Goodnight.

00:54:54.820 --> 00:54:56.835
What is he saying? Bye.

00:55:41.371 --> 00:55:44.076
Hwi, is it you? I want to ask you something.

00:55:44.610 --> 00:55:47.210
Is the cottage where Eun Seop goes far from here?

00:55:47.210 --> 00:55:48.280
No.

00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:51.150
If you follow the trail,

00:55:51.150 --> 00:55:52.955
it takes only about 30 minutes.

00:55:53.610 --> 00:55:56.756
The only problem is that the trail is pretty rough.

00:55:57.820 --> 00:56:01.196
You're not going there right now, are you?

00:56:01.460 --> 00:56:03.021
You can't.

00:56:03.021 --> 00:56:04.360
Look at the sky.

00:56:04.360 --> 00:56:06.791
It's completely covered with dark clouds.

00:56:06.791 --> 00:56:10.605
If you go there alone and it starts raining, you might die.

00:56:11.001 --> 00:56:13.705
Okay. Don't worry.

00:56:16.001 --> 00:56:17.546
I'm not going there.

00:56:18.411 --> 00:56:19.585
Never.

00:56:26.980 --> 00:56:28.625
Eun Seop!

00:56:35.561 --> 00:56:37.035
Eun Seop!

00:56:43.530 --> 00:56:44.946
When I was little,

00:56:45.331 --> 00:56:48.076
my mom left me alone in the house from time to time.

00:56:49.601 --> 00:56:51.515
And on those days,

00:56:52.641 --> 00:56:55.116
I felt anxious all day long for some odd reason.

00:56:55.411 --> 00:56:57.055
Eun Seop!

00:56:59.150 --> 00:57:01.055
When I was looking for you earlier,

00:57:02.021 --> 00:57:04.495
I felt exactly the same way.

00:57:11.431 --> 00:57:12.705
Eun Seop!

00:57:25.041 --> 00:57:27.955
Some people never share their worries their entire lives.

00:57:31.581 --> 00:57:34.256
They build their own cottage inside their hearts...

00:57:35.951 --> 00:57:38.426
and never leave that cottage all their lives.

00:57:42.260 --> 00:57:44.566
Even when they feel lonely, they never admit it.

00:57:48.630 --> 00:57:50.935
Actually, they'd rather dwell in their loneliness.

00:57:53.701 --> 00:57:55.076
They like being alone...

00:57:56.440 --> 00:57:58.245
more than their families.

00:58:15.420 --> 00:58:17.636
Humans are dumber than beasts.

00:58:18.860 --> 00:58:19.935
Why?

00:58:21.331 --> 00:58:23.535
They keep becoming stupid because they like something.

00:58:26.170 --> 00:58:27.276
Does that book say so?

00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:31.046
("Into the White Night")

00:58:32.510 --> 00:58:33.510
When they like something,

00:58:33.510 --> 00:58:35.355
they keep leaping forward even when they know they'll die.

00:58:37.210 --> 00:58:38.625
How stupid.

00:58:39.951 --> 00:58:41.085
Stupid.

00:58:46.491 --> 00:58:48.566
Then they can stop liking something.

00:58:49.161 --> 00:58:50.366
Eun Seop.

00:58:53.291 --> 00:58:55.506
They can stop offering their hearts.

00:58:58.371 --> 00:59:00.130
They can give up on the happiness...

00:59:00.130 --> 00:59:01.776
they'll gain from liking something.

00:59:12.150 --> 00:59:13.785
Since happiness and misery...

00:59:14.081 --> 00:59:16.125
are like two sides of a coin.

00:59:20.951 --> 00:59:22.696
If you don't become happy,

00:59:23.891 --> 00:59:25.636
you won't become miserable either.

00:59:29.260 --> 00:59:30.776
If you don't have something in the first place,

00:59:31.570 --> 00:59:33.076
you won't lose it either,

00:59:33.670 --> 00:59:34.745
Hae Won.

00:59:49.951 --> 00:59:51.125
You can...

00:59:55.561 --> 00:59:57.966
disappear forever so that that person will never see you.

01:00:35.130 --> 01:00:40.046
(Good Night Bookstore Private Blog Posting)

01:00:40.070 --> 01:00:45.015
(Irene told me, "I like you.")

01:00:45.241 --> 01:00:50.015
(I froze in that spot and couldn't say anything.)

01:00:50.340 --> 01:00:55.156
(Is this what you call a time that feels like an eternity?)

01:00:55.380 --> 01:00:57.680
(With those words from her mouth,)

01:00:57.681 --> 01:00:59.926
(the whole universe, including me, came to a stop.)

01:01:00.291 --> 01:01:05.006
(I barely pulled myself together, but all I could say was "Okay.")

01:01:05.030 --> 01:01:11.006
(What on earth have I done? It's such a bitter night.)

01:01:11.271 --> 01:01:15.241
(When the Weather is Fine)

01:01:15.241 --> 01:01:17.041
Don't ever come up here again.

01:01:17.041 --> 01:01:18.271
Even if I'm sick.

01:01:18.271 --> 01:01:19.940
Even if I never go back down.

01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:21.940
All I have to do is accept the fact...

01:01:21.940 --> 01:01:24.041
that you don't like me.

01:01:24.041 --> 01:01:25.411
But it's so hard to do that.

01:01:25.411 --> 01:01:27.550
- I have to go somewhere today. - Where?

01:01:27.550 --> 01:01:29.721
I have something to do in Seoul.

01:01:29.721 --> 01:01:32.050
Why do you look so pale? Did you catch a cold?

01:01:32.050 --> 01:01:33.590
I'll feel better soon.

01:01:33.590 --> 01:01:34.690
Take this.

01:01:34.690 --> 01:01:36.320
What will you do for me then?

01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:38.061
Do I really have to do something?

01:01:38.061 --> 01:01:39.590
I want you to answer me.

01:01:39.590 --> 01:01:42.136
Tell me how you feel about me liking you.
