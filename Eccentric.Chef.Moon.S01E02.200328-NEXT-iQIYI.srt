<b>What do I do?</b>

8
00:01:23,345 --> 00:01:25,870
<b>We've been having ramyeon for days now.</b>

9

<b>And you're calling this a meal?</b>

10
00:01:28,345 --> 00:01:30,280
<b>Then are we supposed to drive out

11

<b>[ We don't have anything in the kitchen. ]</b>

13

<b>Hey, aren't you tired of eating that?</b>

14
00:01:41,864 --> 00:01:43,260
<b>[ Why are you picking on her? ]</b>

15
00:01:44,035 --> 00:01:45,290
<b>Darn it.</b>

16
00:01:47,235 --> 00:01:48,429
<b>We were eating!</b>

17
00:01:49,135 --> 00:01:50,870
<b>Why are you taking that?</b>

18
00:01:53,005 --> 00:01:54,070
<b>Hey!</b>

19

We need space for the good stuff.</b>

21

<b>Thank you for the meal!</b>

22
00:02:45,795 --> 00:02:46,790
<b>Unbelievable.</b>

23

24
00:03:10,685 --> 00:03:11,780

26
00:03:24,735 --> 00:03:25,830
<b>What?</b>

27
00:03:26,195 --> 00:03:27,999
<b>You said you'll sell the place

<b>What about Seol-a?</b>

30

<b>Right.</b>

32
00:03:40,385 --> 00:03:41,710
<b>But don't you think it's weird?</b>

33
00:03:42,045 --> 00:03:46,550
<b>The mom must have a reason
why she left her with you.</b>

34
00:03:46,755 --> 00:03:50,354
<b>It's too mean to just send her away.</b>

35
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,050
<b>Do I look like a charity to you?</b>

36
00:03:52,495 --> 00:03:55,820
<b>I've never seen her
and she's not even related to me.</b>

37
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:57,730
<b>So why should I keep her?</b>

38
00:03:58,735 --> 00:04:00,030
<b>I don't know.</b>

39

<b>Let's go.</b>

44

<b>Just get in.
The security team will take care of it.</b>

45
00:05:06,295 --> 00:05:07,600
<b>How can we just leave like this?</b>

46
00:05:07,865 --> 00:05:09,730
<b>Bella is gone!</b>

47

49
00:05:14,905 --> 00:05:16,140
<b>She's dead, okay?</b>

50
00:05:17,145 --> 00:05:19,540
<b>She fell into the river in this weather.</b>

51
00:05:19,645 --> 00:05:21,110
<b>Do you really expect her to be alive?</b>

52
00:05:22,645 --> 00:05:24,980
<b>But still, how can we leave like this?</b>

53
00:05:25,485 --> 00:05:27,380
<b>- We need to at least try...
- Are you trying</b>

54
00:05:28,825 --> 00:05:30,090
<b>to destroy me?</b>

55
00:05:31,055 --> 00:05:32,554

60
00:05:46,275 --> 00:05:47,740
<b>Don't say anything.</b>

61
00:06:06,495 --> 00:06:08,420
<b>Where did she go? Gosh.</b>

62
00:06:12,395 --> 00:06:14,700
<b>Gosh, where is she?</b>

00:11:42,865 --> 00:11:44,234
<b>Did you run out of fear?</b>

160
00:11:44,235 --> 00:11:48,930
<b>Seol-a, why did you go up
the mountains so late at night?</b>

161
00:11:48,965 --> 00:11:51,374
<b>Are you okay? Are you thirsty?
Do you need water?</b>

162
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:53,274
<b>- No?
- Seol-a.</b>

163
00:11:53,275 --> 00:11:55,700
<b>Where's Seung-mo? Your dad?</b>

164
00:11:55,805 --> 00:11:58,344
<b>- In the mountains. A woman.
- Yes?</b>

165
00:11:58,345 --> 00:12:01,384
<b>My dad was in a mess
and there was blood everywhere.</b>

166
00:12:01,385 --> 00:12:02,684
<b>Blood? Oh my goodness!</b>

167
00:12:02,685 --> 00:12:04,914
<b>Who? Where did this happen?</b>

168
00:12:04,915 --> 00:12:06,314
<b>All the way over there!</b>

169
00:12:06,315 --> 00:12:08,780
<b>- Over there? Where?
- Over there?</b>

170
00:12:11,095 --> 00:12:13,794
<b>- Goodness! What's happening?
- Gosh, Chef Moon!</b>

171
00:12:13,795 --> 00:12:15,420
<b>Let's go.</b>

172
00:12:15,695 --> 00:12:17,734
<b>Just walk. You can't even run.</b>

173
00:12:17,735 --> 00:12:19,034
<b>- Chef Moon!
- Chef Moon!</b>

174

<b>- Chef Moon!
- My goodness.</b>

175
00:12:21,235 --> 00:12:22,560
<b>Take it slow.</b>

176
00:12:22,765 --> 00:12:24,934
<b>Who is this lady?</b>

177
00:12:24,935 --> 00:12:26,304
<b>Take this, please.</b>

178
00:12:26,305 --> 00:12:28,844
<b>I am a man with great strength,</b>

179
00:12:28,845 --> 00:12:31,570
<b>but I hurt my back
at the county's athletic meet.</b>

180
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:34,980
<b>I may be smart, but I'm not fit at all.</b>

181
00:12:35,315 --> 00:12:38,014
<b>You know it.
I have dislocations all the time.</b>

182
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,610
<b>That's why I can't put my arms behind.</b>

183
00:12:40,055 --> 00:12:41,750
<b>Do you want me to support her?</b>

184
00:12:42,385 --> 00:12:44,824
<b>- No, it's her butt. What should I do?
- Just get out!</b>

185
00:12:44,825 --> 00:12:47,260
<b>- Goodness, isn't this blood?
- What?</b>

186
00:12:47,365 --> 00:12:50,994
<b>- There's blood!
- Gosh, what is going on?</b>

187
00:12:50,995 --> 00:12:53,804
<b>Flip it around. My goodness.</b>

188
00:12:53,805 --> 00:12:55,660
<b>What is going on?</b>

189
00:12:59,035 --> 00:13:00,270
<b>Gosh.</b>

190
00:13:01,045 --> 00:13:02,140
<b>Goodness.</b>

191
00:13:04,775 --> 00:13:07,680
<b>What's taking the ambulance so long?</b>

192
00:13:07,715 --> 00:13:11,184
<b>By the way, did that lady
get hit by a boar?</b>

193
00:13:11,185 --> 00:13:12,454
<b>I don't know.</b>

194
00:13:12,455 --> 00:13:14,280
<b>Let me catch my breath.</b>

195
00:13:14,555 --> 00:13:17,094
<b>The county office should've caught
all the boars in advance.</b>

196
00:13:17,095 --> 00:13:18,794
<b>Look, a person is injured.</b>

197
00:13:18,795 --> 00:13:20,494
<b>No wonder civil servants are condemned.</b>

198
00:13:20,495 --> 00:13:22,194
<b>I should write a petition
to the Blue House.</b>

199
00:13:22,195 --> 00:13:23,994
<b>To the Blue House? Look at you.</b>

200
00:13:23,995 --> 00:13:26,194
<b>Why do you always blame the county office
for everything?</b>

201
00:13:26,195 --> 00:13:27,734
<b>What did we do wrong?</b>

202
00:13:27,735 --> 00:13:30,264
<b>Why do you have to make
a fuss about everything?</b>

203
00:13:30,265 --> 00:13:31,504
<b>We have a witness!</b>

204
00:13:31,505 --> 00:13:33,274
<b>A witness we carried
all the way from the woods.</b>

205
00:13:33,275 --> 00:13:34,974
<b>Come on, Chef Moon. Am I right or wrong?</b>

206
00:13:34,975 --> 00:13:36,074
<b>Right, go ahead and speak.</b>

207
00:13:36,075 --> 00:13:37,314
<b>I said I don't know.</b>

208
00:13:37,315 --> 00:13:38,614
<b>Everyone, just stop.</b>

209
00:13:38,615 --> 00:13:40,514
<b>A person is lying down with an injury.</b>

210
00:13:40,515 --> 00:13:42,344
<b>Look at all that blood.</b>

211
00:13:42,345 --> 00:13:45,384
<b>I hope she's not in a critical condition.</b>

212
00:13:45,385 --> 00:13:46,514
<b>What should we do?</b>

213
00:13:46,515 --> 00:13:47,480
<b>Wait.</b>

214
00:13:47,555 --> 00:13:48,584
<b>[ This is when ]</b>

215
00:13:48,585 --> 00:13:50,954
<b>a civil servant should step in

216
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,120
<b>- Okay.
- What?</b>

217
00:13:52,355 --> 00:13:53,960

218

00:14:02,705 --> 00:14:03,900
<b>She's pretty.</b>

221
00:14:05,635 --> 00:14:07,240
<b>- She's pretty?
- Yes.</b>

222
00:14:07,475 --> 00:14:09,844

223
00:14:09,845 --> 00:14:13,074
<b>[ - Gosh, why isn't the ambulance coming?
- How could you say that? ]</b>

224
00:14:13,075 --> 00:14:14,184
<b>- Gosh.
- Ouch!</b>

225
00:14:14,185 --> 00:14:16,780
<b>- You're pathetic.
- What did I do wrong?</b>

226
00:14:17,015 --> 00:14:18,984
<b>[ Tell me, what did I do wrong? ]</b>

<b>[ Seol-a. ]</b>

230

<b>Is that lady okay?</b>

232
00:14:34,865 --> 00:14:36,000
<b>Yes.</b>

<b>Don't worry and go inside the home.</b>

234

<b>Oh, you must be hungry.</b>

236
00:14:47,385 --> 00:14:48,580
<b>Wait a second.</b>

00:14:54,555 --> 00:14:57,990
<b>- Nibble on this. Let's go inside the home.
- Okay.</b>

238
00:14:58,425 --> 00:14:59,350

<b>What are you doing?
You didn't ask for my permission.</b>

<b>Well, I called you for a reason.</b>

476
00:26:16,435 --> 00:26:18,570
<b>No. Australia.</b>

<b>No. It looked fake.</b>

489

<b>Hey, that's enough.</b>

497
00:27:12,155 --> 00:27:14,494
<b>That way, you won't be able
to tell the whole nation about it.</b>

498
00:27:14,495 --> 00:27:16,024

<b>Where is the foreign beggar?</b>

525

<b>We dropped her off on the way.</b>

<b>It's late. You should go home now.</b>

528

<b>Who is the woman that went into the house?</b>

529
00:28:42,685 --> 00:28:46,210
<b>Right. She seemed new.</b>

530
00:28:49,925 --> 00:28:52,220
<b>I understand.</b>

531

<b>I'm sure it's hard for a single man

<b>- Who raises whom?
- Your daughter.</b>

<b>She's not my daughter.</b>

534

<b>Then who is that woman?</b>

535

<b>What are you thinking?</b>

<b>What's so bad about being curious? Right?</b>

540
00:29:13,845 --> 00:29:17,710
<b>He's one cranky man.</b>

<b>Okay, bye.</b>

<b>See? She's just his relative.</b>

<b>Do you believe that?</b>

551

<b>How did Ms. Pi know about her?</b>

<b>You are the only one whom I told about it.

<b>Forget it.</b>

556
00:30:19,875 --> 00:30:21,440

<b>Right. There is no underwear.</b>

<b>And why do you talk down to me?
You don't know me.</b>

580

<b>It's just comfortable that way.</b>
