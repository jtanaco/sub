<b>That's why I suggested the walk.</b>

158
00:10:33,106 --> 00:10:34,147
<b>Pardon?</b>

159
00:10:34,307 --> 00:10:36,576
<b>She turns nasty whenever she sees me.</b>

160
00:10:36,576 --> 00:10:37,816
<b>I wanted to escape.</b>

161
00:10:41,047 --> 00:10:43,257
<b>- Luo! Luo! Oh, dear. - Luo!</b>

162
00:10:43,257 --> 00:10:45,686
<b>Hey, Luo! Where are you going? Hey!</b>

163
00:10:46,686 --> 00:10:47,686
<b>Luo!</b>

164
00:10:48,297 --> 00:10:49,927
<b>If I catch you...</b>

165
00:10:49,927 --> 00:10:51,157
<b>Luo, it's dangerous.</b>

166
00:10:51,627 --> 00:10:53,267
<b>Luo, where are you going?</b>

167
00:10:53,566 --> 00:10:55,537
<b>Watch the steps. They're dangerous!</b>

168
00:10:55,537 --> 00:10:57,336
<b>Luo, stop! My gosh.</b>

169
00:11:00,206 --> 00:11:02,137
<b>Hey! That punk.</b>

170
00:11:03,106 --> 00:11:04,177
<b>Luo!</b>

171
00:11:48,986 --> 00:11:51,887
<b>(Positive symptoms are getting worse.)</b>

172
00:11:57,527 --> 00:11:58,797
<b>(Severe symptoms of visual hallucination)</b>

173
00:11:58,797 --> 00:12:00,096
<b>(Decrease in cognitive functions)</b>

174
00:12:06,106 --> 00:12:08,706
<b>The Medical Psychiatry Center will get built faster than planned.</b>

175
00:12:08,807 --> 00:12:09,807
<b>Oh, really?</b>

176
00:12:10,807 --> 00:12:13,576
<b>Dr. In, be honest with me.</b>

177
00:12:13,976 --> 00:12:16,076
<b>Who do you think will be the first person to make director?</b>

178
00:12:17,877 --> 00:12:20,716
<b>Can I really be honest, sir?</b>

179
00:12:21,247 --> 00:12:22,816
<b>Of course.</b>

180
00:12:24,316 --> 00:12:28,057
<b>I think Dr. Park will get appointed as the director.</b>

181
00:12:29,657 --> 00:12:31,196
<b>That was too honest of you.</b>

182
00:12:31,966 --> 00:12:34,966
<b>But I personally want you to be the director...</b>

183
00:12:35,167 --> 00:12:36,966
<b>because I want the new medical center...</b>

184
00:12:36,966 --> 00:12:39,566
<b>to implement your treatment methods.</b>

185
00:12:40,167 --> 00:12:42,007
<b>And of course, that's probably because...</b>

186
00:12:42,007 --> 00:12:43,836
<b>I'm currently following the path that you once took.</b>

187
00:12:45,377 --> 00:12:46,706
<b>Do you really mean that?</b>

188
00:12:46,706 --> 00:12:48,917
<b>You just saw how honest I was.</b>

189
00:12:50,976 --> 00:12:53,186
<b>Then I'm going to need your help.</b>

190
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,456
<b>What do you need me to do?</b>

191
00:12:55,456 --> 00:12:57,116
<b>Find Si Joon's weakness for me.</b>

192
00:12:57,856 --> 00:12:59,557
<b>Give me something I can use to pressure Dr. Park.</b>

193
00:13:05,167 --> 00:13:07,167
<b>The hospital director and Dr. Park graduated the same high school.</b>

194
00:13:07,167 --> 00:13:08,436
<b>You didn't know that, did you?</b>

195
00:13:10,196 --> 00:13:12,106
<b>No, sir. I didn't know.</b>

196
00:13:14,807 --> 00:13:17,377
<b>I'm not trying to be the director because I want authority.</b>

197
00:13:18,076 --> 00:13:19,377
<b>I'm a doctor, too.</b>

198
00:13:19,377 --> 00:13:21,377
<b>I care about my patients as much as everyone else.</b>

199
00:13:22,616 --> 00:13:25,047
<b>But if we continue to let Dr. Park and Si Joon do things their way,</b>

200
00:13:25,047 --> 00:13:26,486
<b>the hospital will eventually shut down.</b>

201
00:13:28,186 --> 00:13:29,787
<b>I don't think many of you know this,</b>

202
00:13:29,787 --> 00:13:31,856
<b>but mental illnesses are contagious.</b>

203
00:13:32,557 --> 00:13:33,627
<b>Look around us.</b>

204
00:13:33,887 --> 00:13:35,856
<b>So many people are suffering from panic disorder.</b>

205
00:13:35,956 --> 00:13:37,897
<b>And it'll only get worse with time.</b>

206
00:13:37,897 --> 00:13:40,366
<b>We can't continue to handle things like Si Joon does.</b>

207
00:13:43,096 --> 00:13:44,236
<b>Are you going to help me?</b>

208
00:13:48,907 --> 00:13:51,106
<b>Yes, I'll help you, sir.</b>

209
00:13:51,106 --> 00:13:52,846
<b>For the sake of the Medical Psychiatry Center.</b>

210
00:13:53,807 --> 00:13:54,846
<b>Great.</b>

211
00:13:54,976 --> 00:13:58,517
<b>Let's work hard for the mental health of our citizens.</b>

212
00:14:23,336 --> 00:14:26,007
<b>Okay, I understand what you mean.</b>

213
00:14:26,277 --> 00:14:28,946
<b>I'll talk to Dr. Lee about it.</b>

214
00:14:29,177 --> 00:14:31,047
<b>I feel a little uneasy...</b>

215
00:14:31,846 --> 00:14:33,586
<b>now that I've told you everything.</b>

216
00:14:34,616 --> 00:14:38,657
<b>I understand that Dr. Lee cares a lot about his patients.</b>

217
00:14:39,326 --> 00:14:40,856
<b>But there should be a limit.</b>

218
00:14:41,287 --> 00:14:44,397
<b>Patients need to sleep at night, but he never sleeps.</b>

219
00:14:45,267 --> 00:14:46,427
<b>I get what you mean.</b>

220
00:14:47,566 --> 00:14:51,167
<b>I'm worried that the nurses working at the ward...</b>

221
00:14:51,537 --> 00:14:53,606
<b>might start a protest or something.</b>

222
00:14:54,667 --> 00:14:57,277
<b>Considering Luo's condition,</b>

223
00:14:57,277 --> 00:15:01,007
<b>it's better to just give him sleeping pills so he could sleep.</b>

224
00:15:02,147 --> 00:15:04,517
<b>He's about to turn into a zombie.</b>

225
00:15:04,517 --> 00:15:06,147
<b>We should use a stronger...</b>

226
00:15:06,147 --> 00:15:07,216
<b>Ma'am.</b>

227
00:15:08,917 --> 00:15:10,356
<b>I understand what you mean.</b>

228
00:15:11,356 --> 00:15:13,527
<b>But the doctor in charge has full authority...</b>

229
00:15:14,157 --> 00:15:15,897
<b>over what he or she prescribes to the patient.</b>

230
00:15:17,527 --> 00:15:19,027
<b>I must've crossed the line.</b>

231
00:15:19,466 --> 00:15:20,627
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

232
00:15:23,466 --> 00:15:24,596
<b>I'll be off now.</b>

233
00:15:40,047 --> 00:15:41,486
<b>Hello, you're Luo's mother.</b>

234
00:15:43,517 --> 00:15:45,086
<b>You want to have him discharged?</b>

235
00:15:45,086 --> 00:15:47,586
<b>We need to go back to Vietnam.</b>

236
00:15:48,527 --> 00:15:50,427
<b>If he goes to school there for another semester,</b>

237
00:15:50,427 --> 00:15:52,027
<b>he can go to college through a special admission process...</b>

238
00:15:52,027 --> 00:15:53,326
<b>for Koreans who reside abroad.</b>

239
00:15:53,797 --> 00:15:55,297
<b>That's the main reason we lived abroad.</b>

240
00:15:55,836 --> 00:15:57,966
<b>And I can't just give that up now.</b>

241
00:15:59,267 --> 00:16:00,736
<b>Luo can't get discharged.</b>

242
00:16:01,267 --> 00:16:03,836
<b>I have every right to take my son home.</b>

243
00:16:04,277 --> 00:16:05,377
<b>Why can't he get discharged?</b>

244
00:16:05,706 --> 00:16:06,846
<b>His condition got worse.</b>

245
00:16:07,807 --> 00:16:08,877
<b>Why?</b>

246
00:16:08,877 --> 00:16:11,346
<b>I'll have to look into it.</b>

247
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:13,216
<b>He was hospitalized for three months.</b>

248
00:16:13,216 --> 00:16:15,787
<b>How could you let his condition get worse?</b>

249
00:16:17,186 --> 00:16:20,927
<b>Three months is nothing compared to how long...</b>

250
00:16:21,686 --> 00:16:23,297
<b>he's been discarded.</b>

251
00:16:25,696 --> 00:16:26,826
<b>Are you saying...</b>

252
00:16:27,366 --> 00:16:30,096
<b>he turned out this way because I discarded him?</b>

253
00:16:30,936 --> 00:16:34,007
<b>Do you think I wanted him to stay in that tiny apartment room?</b>

254
00:16:34,807 --> 00:16:37,436
<b>I had no idea that he was being called a returnee...</b>

255
00:16:37,436 --> 00:16:38,877
<b>(Returnee: A student who returns to Korea...)</b>

256
00:16:38,877 --> 00:16:40,106
<b>(for having failed to adjust abroad)</b>

257
00:16:40,106 --> 00:16:41,507
<b>I didn't know that.</b>

258
00:16:41,507 --> 00:16:42,716
<b>As his doctor,</b>

259
00:16:43,177 --> 00:16:46,846
<b>I'm just saying he needs more time to receive proper treatment.</b>

260
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:48,147
<b>Dr. Lee.</b>

261
00:16:49,257 --> 00:16:51,186
<b>Are you confident in curing my son?</b>

262
00:16:52,456 --> 00:16:54,527
<b>I asked if you're confident.</b>

263
00:16:59,566 --> 00:17:01,966
<b>- Everyone, follow me. - Okay.</b>

264
00:17:01,966 --> 00:17:03,397
<b>- Okay. - Okay.</b>

265
00:17:03,566 --> 00:17:04,866
<b>From now on...</b>

266
00:17:04,866 --> 00:17:06,237
<b>- "From now on..." - "From now on..."</b>

267
00:17:06,237 --> 00:17:08,836
<b>Forget about the painful past!</b>

268
00:17:08,836 --> 00:17:11,207
<b>- "Forget about the painful past!" - "Forget about the painful past!"</b>

269
00:17:11,207 --> 00:17:13,906
<b>And let's just have fun!</b>

270
00:17:13,906 --> 00:17:16,146
<b>- "And let's just have fun!" - "And let's just have fun!"</b>

271
00:17:16,146 --> 00:17:17,176
<b>Let's do this!</b>

272
00:17:19,187 --> 00:17:20,816
<b>1, 2, 3, 4.</b>

273
00:17:20,816 --> 00:17:22,687
<b>(Stage therapy room)</b>

274
00:17:40,636 --> 00:17:41,666
<b>Nice.</b>

275
00:17:43,537 --> 00:17:44,906
<b>Get ready.</b>

276
00:17:45,977 --> 00:17:46,977
<b>Turn!</b>

277
00:17:50,646 --> 00:17:52,187
<b>Woo Joo,</b>

278
00:17:52,187 --> 00:17:54,687
<b>you aren't someone whose boyfriend is allowed to cheat on you.</b>

279
00:17:56,457 --> 00:17:58,656
<b>You changed someone else's life.</b>

280
00:18:15,977 --> 00:18:17,007
<b>No, I'm not confident.</b>

281
00:18:18,106 --> 00:18:21,606
<b>And it's not like my confidence helps me treat my patients.</b>

282
00:18:24,947 --> 00:18:29,086
<b>Today, I will listen to your stories and give you answers.</b>

283
00:18:30,057 --> 00:18:33,356
<b>People are sending me their stories right now.</b>

284
00:18:33,926 --> 00:18:35,896
<b>And here's one I just received.</b>

285
00:18:36,826 --> 00:18:39,066
<b>I don't know when it began,</b>

286
00:18:39,066 --> 00:18:41,326
<b>but I hear a voice whispering in my ear every day.</b>

287
00:18:41,697 --> 00:18:44,366
<b>What drives me crazy is that I keep doing what I'm told...</b>

288
00:18:44,366 --> 00:18:46,406
<b>even when I know it's an auditory hallucination.</b>

289
00:18:47,866 --> 00:18:50,307
<b>Right now, I'm at Seogang Bridge.</b>

290
00:18:51,477 --> 00:18:54,606
<b>And now, the voice is telling me to jump in front of a car.</b>

291
00:18:54,977 --> 00:18:57,747
<b>Soul Repairman, please help me.</b>

292
00:20:03,717 --> 00:20:05,146
<b>Hey, wait!</b>

293
00:20:06,616 --> 00:20:08,116
<b>No! Hey!</b>

294
00:20:11,957 --> 00:20:12,957
<b>Wait!</b>

295
00:20:16,926 --> 00:20:20,166
<b>Unlike other schizophrenics,</b>

296
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:22,336
<b>Luo knows he hallucinates and hears things.</b>

297
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:24,566
<b>He also knows he is sick.</b>

298
00:20:25,467 --> 00:20:28,437
<b>And therefore, he knows he needs to take medication.</b>

299
00:20:29,176 --> 00:20:30,307
<b>The problem is...</b>

300
00:20:30,477 --> 00:20:33,376
<b>that his body keeps denying the drugs.</b>

301
00:20:33,906 --> 00:20:35,717
<b>That's where the side effects occur.</b>

302
00:20:36,447 --> 00:20:39,316
<b>Then there's only one answer to the problem.</b>

303
00:20:39,886 --> 00:20:41,086
<b>Dr. Lee.</b>

304
00:20:43,356 --> 00:20:45,957
<b>What should I do, Dr. Lee? I made a huge mistake yesterday.</b>

305
00:20:45,957 --> 00:20:47,227
<b>What did you do?</b>

306
00:20:49,926 --> 00:20:52,527
<b>I couldn't focus on anything else in that very moment.</b>

307
00:20:53,426 --> 00:20:54,967
<b>All I could see was that watch.</b>

308
00:20:55,326 --> 00:20:57,937
<b>All I could think of was that he didn't deserve...</b>

309
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:00,566
<b>to wear that watch.</b>

310
00:21:00,636 --> 00:21:03,336
<b>So you called him and asked him to give it back?</b>

311
00:21:05,477 --> 00:21:09,277
<b>I didn't know I could be such a loser.</b>

<b>Because of that,</b>

313
00:21:12,247 --> 00:21:15,787
<b>my self-esteem hit rock bottom,</b>

314

<b>and I even feel depressed.</b>

315
00:21:17,856 --> 00:21:18,987
<b>Was it expensive?</b>

316
00:21:19,057 --> 00:21:20,557
<b>Yes, very.</b>

317
00:21:21,886 --> 00:21:23,557
<b>I got cast as the main character for the first time in my life,</b>

<b>Come to think of it, it was very pathetic of me.</b>

320

<b>Why did I get him a watch when I was the one who got the role?</b>

321
00:21:30,997 --> 00:21:33,066
<b>He should've been the one congratulating me.</b>

322
00:21:36,376 --> 00:21:39,346
<b>After I bought him that, I was broke for a while.</b>

323

<b>So I went around looking like a homeless person.</b>

<b>I was suddenly reminded of that, and it made me furious.</b>

00:30:02,477 --> 00:30:03,576
<b>Do you think it was the guardian?</b>

467
00:30:03,576 --> 00:30:05,076
<b>Guardians are normally the ones to file reports.</b>

468
00:30:05,217 --> 00:30:06,687
<b>They normally file lawsuits against the hospital...</b>

469
00:30:06,687 --> 00:30:08,586
<b>rather than send reports to public institutions.</b>

470
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:12,856
<b>The fact that the person sent a report to the commission...</b>

471
00:30:13,757 --> 00:30:15,826
<b>means that he or she wants to stay anonymous.</b>

472
00:30:18,396 --> 00:30:20,967
<b>Don't you think this was intentional?</b>

473
00:30:21,596 --> 00:30:24,037
<b>There's a famous saying for a situation like this.</b>

474
00:30:25,797 --> 00:30:27,636
<b>"The person closest to you is the culprit."</b>

475
00:30:27,737 --> 00:30:29,106
<b>- Who's that? - Dr. In.</b>

476
00:30:29,876 --> 00:30:31,007
<b>My gosh.</b>

477
00:30:31,406 --> 00:30:33,277
<b>Sorry. I'm sorry.</b>

478
00:30:34,777 --> 00:30:36,846
<b>The cops will carry out an investigation...</b>

479
00:30:36,846 --> 00:30:38,376
<b>and check the hospital now that they got a report.</b>

480
00:30:38,376 --> 00:30:39,816
<b>Whoever made a report might've aimed for that.</b>

481
00:30:40,517 --> 00:30:42,856
<b>That means someone truly has a problem with something.</b>

482
00:30:43,787 --> 00:30:47,187
<b>The ward nurses always seemed dissatisfied.</b>

483
00:30:47,187 --> 00:30:49,997
<b>I also overheard them whisper to each other.</b>

484
00:30:50,396 --> 00:30:51,697
<b>They had a problem with Dr. Lee...</b>

485
00:30:51,697 --> 00:30:53,767
<b>not prescribing drugs to his patients to have them sleep.</b>

486
00:30:55,727 --> 00:30:58,037
<b>Think back and see if you might've done anything...</b>

487
00:30:58,037 --> 00:31:00,467
<b>to create any kind of an issue with Patient Park Luo.</b>

488
00:31:01,066 --> 00:31:02,606
<b>The police might show up again to investigate.</b>

489
00:31:04,136 --> 00:31:05,207
<b>- Okay. - Okay.</b>

490
00:31:08,447 --> 00:31:11,176
<b>Who made this kind of report?</b>

491
00:31:11,777 --> 00:31:14,687
<b>It was sent to the human rights commission, so we have no idea.</b>

492
00:31:14,687 --> 00:31:16,416
<b>Does this happen often?</b>

493
00:31:17,316 --> 00:31:20,227
<b>Sometimes. It sometimes happens at other hospitals as well.</b>

494
00:31:21,326 --> 00:31:22,687
<b>About two years ago,</b>

495
00:31:23,326 --> 00:31:24,997
<b>a patient filed a lawsuit...</b>

496
00:31:24,997 --> 00:31:27,727
<b>as she got discharged saying she was abused by a nurse.</b>

497
00:31:28,626 --> 00:31:31,596
<b>But we found out it wasn't true thanks to the CCTV footage.</b>

498
00:31:33,467 --> 00:31:35,207
<b>Don't worry, Woo Joo.</b>

499
00:31:35,207 --> 00:31:37,636
<b>Dr. Lee took care of Luo with so much affection.</b>

500
00:31:38,007 --> 00:31:40,646
<b>He didn't even make him take any drugs...</b>

501
00:31:40,646 --> 00:31:41,846
<b>because most drugs didn't work on him.</b>

502
00:31:42,676 --> 00:31:46,886
<b>But because of that, the nurses had to suffer every night.</b>

503
00:31:47,116 --> 00:31:49,086
<b>Someone did this to get him in trouble.</b>

504
00:31:49,346 --> 00:31:51,017
<b>Whoever did this is trying to scar...</b>

505
00:31:51,017 --> 00:31:53,027
<b>- Dr. Lee's reputation. - What?</b>

506
00:31:53,187 --> 00:31:54,826
<b>I'm going to find out who made the report.</b>

507
00:32:03,409 --> 00:32:04,609
<b>My goodness.</b>

508
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,501
<b>What are you doing here?</b>

509
00:32:09,671 --> 00:32:10,931
<b>Are you here to see me?</b>

510
00:32:10,931 --> 00:32:13,000
<b>I'm not exactly here to see you, but...</b>

511
00:32:13,271 --> 00:32:15,840
<b>Oh. Were you worried?</b>

512
00:32:17,811 --> 00:32:18,980
<b>I don't worry.</b>

513
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:21,881
<b>Why should I worry? You did nothing wrong.</b>

514
00:32:22,681 --> 00:32:24,751
<b>Why can't you worry a bit about me?</b>

515
00:32:24,751 --> 00:32:26,520
<b>This thing called worry.</b>

516
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:29,420
<b>The more you worry, the more worries you gain.</b>

517
00:32:29,791 --> 00:32:31,690
<b>So you must never start at all.</b>

518
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:37,261
<b>On a day like this,</b>

519
00:32:37,461 --> 00:32:40,300
<b>I bet you must have a lot on your mind.</b>

520
00:32:41,461 --> 00:32:43,901
<b>So I thought you'd need this.</b>

521
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:51,940
<b>If there's someone you want to cuss out,</b>

522
00:32:52,071 --> 00:32:54,380
<b>don't hold it in and scream into this bag.</b>

523
00:32:56,551 --> 00:32:59,821
<b>I'm off to pick up a watch.</b>

524
00:33:03,851 --> 00:33:07,860
<b>(Doctor Lee Si Joon)</b>

525
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:28,980
<b>- Two outs. - Pardon?</b>

526
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:32,280
<b>I set a rule when I became a hospital director.</b>

527
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,420
<b>Whatever the situation, hold back three times.</b>

528
00:33:37,491 --> 00:33:40,491
<b>Whatever mistake the person made, forgive them three times.</b>

529
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:45,500
<b>I thought a hospital director should be...</b>

530
00:33:45,961 --> 00:33:47,700
<b>benevolent and broad-minded.</b>

531
00:33:48,801 --> 00:33:51,000
<b>But you just scored two outs.</b>

532
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:52,941
<b>What'll you do now?</b>

533
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,241
<b>I'm sorry about the search and seizure.</b>

534
00:33:56,771 --> 00:33:57,970
<b>I'll take responsibility for it.</b>

535
00:33:57,970 --> 00:33:58,980
<b>"Responsibility"?</b>

536
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:01,281
<b>Will you resign as a doctor?</b>

537
00:34:01,281 --> 00:34:02,650
<b>No, not that.</b>

538
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:05,411
<b>Then will you pull your Dr. Park card again?</b>

539
00:34:06,351 --> 00:34:08,680
<b>It has nothing to do with Dr. Park.</b>

540
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,751
<b>Then does it have something to do with me?</b>

541
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:16,161
<b>I'm the one who might have to be interviewed by the police.</b>

542
00:34:17,031 --> 00:34:18,091
<b>You?</b>

543
00:34:18,091 --> 00:34:20,700
<b>My goodness. You know nothing about the law.</b>

544
00:34:22,001 --> 00:34:25,571
<b>But, as I said, I will hold back this time.</b>

545
00:34:26,571 --> 00:34:27,971
<b>Because I'm the hospital director.</b>

546
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:30,710
<b>But next time will be your third time out.</b>

547
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:34,180
<b>I don't have to tell you what'll happen then, right?</b>

548
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:53,761
<b>I also got reported when I opened my clinic.</b>

549
00:34:53,761 --> 00:34:56,230
<b>- By whom? - By my neighbor.</b>

550
00:34:56,471 --> 00:34:59,140
<b>He said my clinic scared them and ruined the neighborhood.</b>

551
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:02,101
<b>That loser said a psychiatric clinic is...</b>

552
00:35:02,101 --> 00:35:05,071
<b>an unpleasant facility and against public welfare.</b>

553
00:35:05,071 --> 00:35:06,710
<b>I still feel like cursing him.</b>

554
00:35:06,911 --> 00:35:10,580
<b>I guess she was really ticked off at the time.</b>

555
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:12,980
<b>I sued my neighbor right back,</b>

556
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,450
<b>won, and opened my clinic.</b>

557
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:15,480
<b>Well done.</b>

558
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:22,221
<b>Si Joon, you look depressed today.</b>

559
00:35:22,591 --> 00:35:23,730
<b>Are you okay?</b>

560
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:28,230
<b>I don't care what happens to me,</b>

561
00:35:28,561 --> 00:35:32,270
<b>but I never imagined that our director would be investigated.</b>

562
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:34,601
<b>The director's responsible for all legal matters.</b>

563
00:35:35,471 --> 00:35:39,180
<b>Even so, if we were to turn back time,</b>

564
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:41,110
<b>you'd do the same thing. Right?</b>

565
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:45,950
<b>So, how is Ms. Han these days?</b>

566
00:35:47,221 --> 00:35:49,450
<b>She finally admitted that she's a patient.</b>

567
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:51,291
<b>Oh, that's a huge improvement.</b>

568
00:35:52,221 --> 00:35:53,561
<b>I'm analyzing her.</b>

569
00:35:53,561 --> 00:35:54,890
<b>Do you have the result?</b>

570
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:55,990
<b>Not yet.</b>

571
00:35:56,561 --> 00:35:57,960
<b>But what's clear is,</b>

572
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:01,131
<b>it's not a simple intermittent explosive disorder.</b>

573
00:36:04,071 --> 00:36:06,700
<b>- Then what? - Impulsive relationships,</b>

574
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:09,441
<b>fury, capriciousness, mood disorders.</b>

575
00:36:11,071 --> 00:36:13,481
<b>What illness has those characteristics?</b>

576
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,181
<b>Just one comes to mind.</b>

577
00:36:20,181 --> 00:36:21,181
<b>What's that?</b>

578
00:36:24,991 --> 00:36:26,121
<b>No way.</b>

579
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:28,390
<b>It can't be that.</b>

580
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:32,660
<b>You wouldn't have given me a borderline case.</b>

581
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:34,200
<b>(Borderline personality disorder)</b>

582
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,231
<b>Right?</b>

583
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:40,200
<b>What happens if Ms. Han is borderline?</b>

584
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:51,981
<b>This pajeon is delicious.</b>

585
00:36:52,621 --> 00:36:53,720
<b>Why won't you answer?</b>

586
00:36:55,991 --> 00:36:58,290
<b>- What? - You admitted Luo...</b>

587
00:36:58,290 --> 00:37:01,290
<b>against all protocol, but you can't answer this?</b>

588
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:04,160
<b>Stop it, Dong Hyuk.</b>

589
00:37:09,371 --> 00:37:11,830
<b>Okay. Let's stop.</b>

590
00:37:16,941 --> 00:37:18,611
<b>How are you so carefree?</b>

591
00:37:20,941 --> 00:37:21,981
<b>What?</b>

592
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,681
<b>Your patient died last year.</b>

593
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:30,051
<b>You're a doctor and you let that happen to your patient.</b>

594
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,251
<b>How are you so carefree?</b>

595
00:37:32,251 --> 00:37:33,390
<b>How dare you...</b>

596
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:34,460
<b>Listen.</b>

597
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,390
<b>I lost a patient eight years ago,</b>

598
00:37:37,361 --> 00:37:39,100
<b>and even now, day or night,</b>

599
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:41,561
<b>I can't stay sane unless I run all over the place.</b>

600
00:37:43,071 --> 00:37:46,171
<b>I just don't get how you can be so normal.</b>

601
00:37:46,171 --> 00:37:47,371
<b>How dare you say...</b>

602
00:37:47,371 --> 00:37:48,970
<b>Dong Hyuk, please, don't.</b>

603
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:02,280
<b>Don't smirk.</b>

604
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:06,621
<b>Just because I'm over a wound, doesn't mean I'm fine.</b>

605
00:38:22,371 --> 00:38:24,910
<b>Suffering for eight years doesn't make him special.</b>

606
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,481
<b>I guess I messed up.</b>

607
00:38:28,741 --> 00:38:30,751
<b>I shouldn't have referred Ms. Han to him.</b>

608
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:34,481
<b>I didn't know Si Joon was still suffering so much.</b>

609
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:38,020
<b>Ji Young Won.</b>

610
00:38:41,121 --> 00:38:43,261
<b>Why do you always worry only about Si Joon?</b>

611
00:38:44,691 --> 00:38:46,861
<b>- What? - Isn't it time you stopped?</b>

612
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,921
<b>Who reported him?</b>

613
00:39:08,921 --> 00:39:10,650
<b>He can't think of anyone.</b>

614
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,231
<b>So that's the kind of problem a psychiatrist has.</b>

615
00:39:16,491 --> 00:39:18,090
<b>Ji Hee should be careful too.</b>

616
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:20,200
<b>By the way,</b>

617
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:23,100
<b>he told me to get my watch back from Min Wook.</b>

618
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,770
<b>- What should I do? - What else? Do as he says.</b>

619
00:39:27,571 --> 00:39:30,410
<b>Must I show the lowest of my lows to that jerk?</b>

620

<b>Listen. He already saw you at your worst.</b>

<b>You said you called him to give it back.</b>

<b>Thanks.</b>

631

<b>Hey. Why are you thanking him?</b>

632

<b>My gosh.</b>

<b>Is there anything else you want back?</b>

634
00:40:29,331 --> 00:40:30,471
<b>Say so now if there is.</b>

635
00:40:30,471 --> 00:40:31,570
<b>I'm not sure.</b>

636
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:33,601
<b>What else could there be?</b>

637
00:40:33,601 --> 00:40:35,201
<b>The year I wasted on you?</b>

638
00:40:36,371 --> 00:40:38,310
<b>You owe me for the free food I fed you.</b>

639
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:40,680
<b>You ate for free so often here.</b>

640
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:43,280
<b>- Make Woo Joo pay for that. - What?</b>

641
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:46,050
<b>What about the repair cost for my car you wrecked?</b>

642
00:40:47,751 --> 00:40:49,290
<b>Do you even know how much that cost me?</b>

643

<b>- Can't we part ways with grace? - Hey!</b>

644
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:55,591
<b>The moment you cheated on me, that went down the drain.</b>

645
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:56,961
<b>I can't believe this.</b>

646
00:40:57,761 --> 00:40:59,701
<b>How could you be so brazen when it's your fault?</b>

647
00:40:59,701 --> 00:41:01,560
<b>This isn't your first time breaking up...</b>

648
00:41:01,861 --> 00:41:03,001
<b>because of a cheating boyfriend.</b>

649
00:41:05,331 --> 00:41:07,400
<b>If the same thing keeps repeating itself,</b>

650
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:09,670
<b>there's a good reason.</b>

651
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:11,711
<b>I know I'm a jerk,</b>

652

<b>but you have serious issues too.</b>

653
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:25,320
<b>Stop acting like you're so tough!</b>

654
00:41:26,091 --> 00:41:27,520
<b>Goodness, darn it.</b>

655
00:41:32,261 --> 00:41:33,530
<b>Hey, why are you...</b>

656
00:41:34,831 --> 00:41:35,930
<b>He's right.</b>

657
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:40,101
<b>The guy I met before cheated on me too.</b>

658
00:41:43,611 --> 00:41:45,410
<b>Don't cry. He's not worth it.</b>

659

<b>What are you doing here?</b>

<b>I didn't know what to do with this.</b>

667
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:36,020
<b>Right.</b>

668
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,920
<b>You told me to call you. Why didn't you answer my calls?</b>

669

<b>I think I'll be staring at it all night long.</b>

673
00:43:52,001 --> 00:43:54,440
<b>I thought of throwing it in the trash, but that seems wrong.</b>

674
00:43:56,971 --> 00:43:58,611
<b>A burial or drowning?</b>

675

<b>- Or a cremation? - What?</b>

676

<b>Drowning it won't be good for the environment,</b>

677

<b>- I'll bury it. - Let's do that.</b>

679
00:44:18,731 --> 00:44:20,361
<b>This is what you call burying something together.</b>

680
00:44:20,961 --> 00:44:22,030
<b>That's right.</b>

681
00:44:23,331 --> 00:44:25,270
<b>All right, throw it now.</b>

682
00:44:26,341 --> 00:44:29,270
<b>Chuck it as hard as you can, all the way to the top.</b>

683
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:51,591
<b>What an amazing throw.</b>

684
00:44:52,461 --> 00:44:53,800
<b>Are you a shot putter or what?</b>

685
00:44:54,631 --> 00:44:56,770
<b>- That felt so satisfying. - I think it went over.</b>

686
00:44:56,770 --> 00:44:57,871
<b>Although it was nothing.</b>

687
00:44:59,841 --> 00:45:01,241
<b>- How did I do? - Nice!</b>

688
00:45:01,241 --> 00:45:02,371
<b>Nice!</b>

689
00:45:02,471 --> 00:45:04,640
<b>All I did was throw a past memory...</b>

690
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,680
<b>into a heap of trash.</b>

691
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:12,381
<b>But it felt like my wound was buried together in that heap too.</b>

692

<b>Luo asked for help through a podcast three months ago.</b>

693
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:24,290
<b>I was doing a live broadcast,</b>

694
00:45:24,631 --> 00:45:26,300
<b>and he said he was hearing things.</b>

695
00:45:26,831 --> 00:45:29,930
<b>He said that voice kept telling him to throw himself at a car.</b>

696
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:32,940
<b>I had no choice but to get him admitted.</b>

697
00:45:33,601 --> 00:45:36,511
<b>I couldn't reach his guardian for several days.</b>

698
00:45:36,741 --> 00:45:38,310
<b>I did eventually,</b>

699
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:41,081
<b>but his guardian was in Vietnam and couldn't come right away.</b>

700
00:45:41,981 --> 00:45:43,650
<b>I couldn't send him back...</b>

701

<b>the small apartment room he lived alone in.</b>

702
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,150
<b>So I admitted him to the hospital.</b>

703
00:45:47,751 --> 00:45:49,381
<b>But that became an involuntary admission.</b>

704
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:52,221
<b>That was the reason for the search and seizure.</b>

705
00:45:52,991 --> 00:45:54,491
<b>Why is that involuntary?</b>

706
00:45:54,961 --> 00:45:57,290
<b>How could you send back a patient who's so unstable?</b>

707
00:45:57,790 --> 00:46:00,560
<b>We can only hold a patient for three days if there's no guardian.</b>

708
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:07,101
<b>I knew this would become a problem one day.</b>

709

<b>What will happen now?</b>

710
00:46:08,741 --> 00:46:10,810
<b>You said you gain more worries the more you worry.</b>

711
00:46:12,211 --> 00:46:13,481
<b>I'm not worried.</b>

712
00:46:16,451 --> 00:46:17,511

<b>How about we do some stretching?</b>

715
00:46:24,251 --> 00:46:25,991
<b>You gave me a prescription last time.</b>

716
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:27,721
<b>That was very effective.</b>
