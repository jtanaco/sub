<b>If she's like your mask, how is she the best thing in your life?</b>

164
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,765
<b>How can you love her beyond words?</b>

165
00:15:20,369 --> 00:15:22,635
<b>You're too young to know, but...</b>

166
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:24,665
<b>Don't treat me like a child.</b>

167
00:15:24,707 --> 00:15:26,800
<b>Now I know you were playing with me.</b>

168
00:15:26,809 --> 00:15:28,170
<b>For Busan!</b>

169
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,170
<b>- Busan! - Busan!</b>

170
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,905
<b>Cheers!</b>

171
00:15:36,819 --> 00:15:39,085
<b>Does it look like we came all this way as a joke?</b>

172
00:15:39,622 --> 00:15:41,715
<b>Look at me in the eyes when you answer me.</b>

173
00:15:42,158 --> 00:15:44,525
<b>Does my love look like a joke to you?</b>

174
00:16:25,968 --> 00:16:27,825
<b>I know you're lying.</b>

175
00:16:27,937 --> 00:16:30,570
<b>Do you have any idea how miserable I feel right now?</b>

176
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:32,565
<b>It's only an act.</b>

177
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:34,605
<b>My true heart belongs to you.</b>

178
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:40,345
<b>Fine. If you don't believe me,</b>

179
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,375
<b>I'll tell your father about us right now.</b>

180
00:16:45,688 --> 00:16:47,345
<b>Are you crazy?</b>

181
00:17:49,018 --> 00:17:51,275
<b>Get things sorted out with your wife first.</b>

182
00:17:53,222 --> 00:17:55,515
<b>All right. Just wait...</b>

183
00:17:55,891 --> 00:17:58,385
<b>- Just wait for a little while. - You have until tomorrow.</b>

184
00:18:33,829 --> 00:18:37,230
<b>To say "marriage in name only" is so old-fashioned.</b>

185
00:18:37,233 --> 00:18:39,300
<b>Monogamy...</b>

186
00:18:39,301 --> 00:18:41,930
<b>leaves you no choice but to have a marriage in name only.</b>

187
00:18:41,937 --> 00:18:45,865
<b>How can you sleep with just one person all your life?</b>

188
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,510
<b>What a perspective.</b>

189
00:18:49,512 --> 00:18:51,240
<b>Don't you agree, Mr. Yeo?</b>

190
00:18:51,247 --> 00:18:55,350
<b>Not really. I live with someone that's ever-changing.</b>

191
00:18:55,351 --> 00:18:57,820
<b>- Gosh, honey. - I really can't relate.</b>

192
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:00,950
<b>There are many good couples like us.</b>

193
00:19:00,956 --> 00:19:04,925
<b>Dr. Sul, you should find yourself a nice partner.</b>

194
00:19:07,129 --> 00:19:08,895
<b>How about you two?</b>

195
00:19:10,432 --> 00:19:11,460
<b>Us?</b>

196
00:19:11,467 --> 00:19:13,965
<b>Are you happy together, or are you putting on a show?</b>

197
00:19:16,639 --> 00:19:19,865
<b>You tell them. How are we?</b>

198
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:23,575
<b>Why do you think we don't want any kids?</b>

199
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:27,080
<b>Once you have a baby, that's the end for a couple.</b>

200
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:31,375
<b>We decided to be passionate about each other until the end.</b>

201
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:35,215
<b>Is that why you won't have any kids?</b>

202
00:19:36,058 --> 00:19:38,155
<b>Don't you agree, Mr. Yeo?</b>

203
00:19:38,627 --> 00:19:40,720
<b>You might not know this,</b>

204
00:19:40,729 --> 00:19:44,765
<b>but sometimes, kids can make a couple more passionate.</b>

205
00:19:46,569 --> 00:19:48,165
<b>You just don't know it.</b>

206

<b>(Ovulation day)</b>

<b>Joon Young!</b>

209
00:20:07,323 --> 00:20:09,055
<b>Where are you going?</b>

210
00:20:10,593 --> 00:20:12,285
<b>I'm going home.</b>

211
00:20:12,828 --> 00:20:14,630
<b>Did you fight with a friend?</b>

212
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,755
<b>No, I just want to go home.</b>

213
00:20:18,601 --> 00:20:21,325
<b>Where did your dad go anyway?</b>

214
00:20:30,512 --> 00:20:32,545
<b>What? What is it?</b>

215
00:20:33,048 --> 00:20:35,210
<b>We received an email from China.</b>

216
00:20:35,217 --> 00:20:37,050
<b>It looks like...</b>

217
00:20:37,052 --> 00:20:39,445
<b>What? What is it about?</b>

218
00:20:40,089 --> 00:20:44,415
<b>In short, they decided not to invest in our project.</b>

219
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:49,955
<b>You better talk to them as soon as day breaks.</b>

220

<b>(To Sun Woo, Happy anniversary. Love, Tae Oh)</b>

<b>Joon Young.</b>

222
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,785
<b>What happened?</b>

223
00:21:53,629 --> 00:21:55,290
<b>Did you come home alone?</b>

224
00:21:55,297 --> 00:21:57,495
<b>He came with me.</b>

225
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,500
<b>Maybe he had a fight with his friends.</b>

226
00:22:00,502 --> 00:22:02,830
<b>I asked him what happened on our way here,</b>

227
00:22:02,838 --> 00:22:04,595
<b>but he won't tell me.</b>

228
00:22:30,699 --> 00:22:33,325
<b>(Baseball camp with Dad!)</b>

229
00:22:43,979 --> 00:22:45,705
<b>Would you also like a drink?</b>

230
00:22:45,714 --> 00:22:48,105
<b>Sure. Sounds good.</b>

231
00:23:10,506 --> 00:23:12,800
<b>I thought you left because you weren't feeling very well.</b>

232
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:14,705
<b>Were you drinking by yourself?</b>

233
00:23:15,077 --> 00:23:17,135
<b>I figured I should leave...</b>

234
00:23:18,247 --> 00:23:20,775
<b>so Tae Oh could relax and enjoy the party.</b>

235
00:23:23,419 --> 00:23:26,815
<b>By the way, what's with that luggage bag?</b>

236
00:23:27,222 --> 00:23:28,915
<b>I'm going to throw it away.</b>

237
00:23:31,727 --> 00:23:33,385
<b>Even that photo?</b>

238
00:23:35,697 --> 00:23:38,795
<b>Yes, I don't really like it.</b>

239
00:23:39,935 --> 00:23:42,865
<b>After I hung it up on the wall, it kind of felt a little silly.</b>

240
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:45,705
<b>I had my fun, so it can go.</b>

241
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:59,950
<b>Why do you look so uneasy?</b>

242
00:23:59,955 --> 00:24:03,715
<b>- Do you have something to say? - No, not at all.</b>

243
00:24:09,798 --> 00:24:12,795
<b>- By the way, about Tae Oh. - Yes?</b>

244
00:24:13,168 --> 00:24:15,235
<b>Why did he and Je Hyuk fight?</b>

245
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,465
<b>They always fight.</b>

246
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:25,040
<b>From what I heard, Je Hyuk provoked him...</b>

247
00:24:25,047 --> 00:24:29,410
<b>saying he must be happy to receive so much love...</b>

248
00:24:29,418 --> 00:24:31,215
<b>from his competent wife.</b>

249
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:36,755
<b>I don't get why Je Hyuk is so jealous of him.</b>

250
00:24:38,293 --> 00:24:42,560
<b>But then again, he's been jealous ever since you moved to Gosan...</b>

251
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:44,355
<b>after you gave birth to Joon Young.</b>

252
00:24:45,367 --> 00:24:49,095
<b>You're exactly the type of woman he's always wanted to be with.</b>

253
00:24:51,607 --> 00:24:55,705
<b>I wonder if he has feelings for you.</b>

254
00:24:59,982 --> 00:25:01,705
<b>What do you mean?</b>

255
00:25:01,884 --> 00:25:05,015
<b>We were drinking a while ago, and he said...</b>

256
00:25:06,154 --> 00:25:09,915
<b>he thinks it's impossible to sleep with only one woman.</b>

257
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:11,955
<b>My gosh.</b>

258
00:25:12,194 --> 00:25:16,355
<b>You should've seen Ye Rim's face as she heard him say that.</b>

259
00:25:18,333 --> 00:25:20,025
<b>Is that funny to you?</b>

260
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,365
<b>No, I mean...</b>

261
00:25:27,009 --> 00:25:30,275
<b>I just couldn't believe what was coming out of his mouth.</b>

262
00:25:30,879 --> 00:25:33,840
<b>So I'm just saying I was dumbfounded to see him say that...</b>

263
00:25:33,849 --> 00:25:36,215
<b>when his wife was right next to him.</b>

264
00:25:42,658 --> 00:25:45,785
<b>You don't care about other people's feelings, do you?</b>

265
00:25:46,828 --> 00:25:49,155
<b>You don't care if people are miserable or not.</b>

266
00:25:49,731 --> 00:25:52,700
<b>You just watch everything from afar and have fun.</b>

267
00:25:52,701 --> 00:25:54,465
<b>What do you mean I have fun?</b>

268
00:25:57,406 --> 00:25:59,070
<b>How could you say that?</b>

269
00:25:59,074 --> 00:26:00,800
<b>You had fun when you told me that I'm being oversensitive,</b>

270
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,535
<b>didn't you?</b>

271
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:06,105
<b>You told me it must be hard to live with a handsome husband.</b>

272
00:26:15,057 --> 00:26:17,885
<b>Do... Do you...</b>

273
00:26:18,961 --> 00:26:20,725
<b>Do you know everything?</b>

274
00:26:24,099 --> 00:26:25,765
<b>Yes.</b>

275
00:26:35,377 --> 00:26:37,275
<b>I also know...</b>

276
00:26:38,313 --> 00:26:42,015
<b>that you warned Tae Oh that I might go after him.</b>

277
00:26:47,155 --> 00:26:49,285
<b>Don't get me wrong.</b>

278
00:26:49,391 --> 00:26:52,390
<b>You see... Listen.</b>

279
00:26:52,394 --> 00:26:54,855
<b>He told me that he's going to end it.</b>

280
00:26:54,896 --> 00:26:59,195
<b>He asked me to keep it a secret until then, so I had no choice.</b>

281
00:27:00,235 --> 00:27:04,195
<b>You have no idea how angry I was at him.</b>

282
00:27:07,142 --> 00:27:08,905
<b>When was that?</b>

283
00:27:10,145 --> 00:27:12,205
<b>About a month ago,</b>

284
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:16,810
<b>he called me out for a drink...</b>

285
00:27:16,818 --> 00:27:18,445
<b>out of nowhere.</b>

286
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,720
<b>Something felt a bit weird, so I asked him a few stuff,</b>

287
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:24,115
<b>and he eventually told me everything.</b>

288
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:28,355
<b>I'm really sorry I didn't tell you.</b>

289
00:27:28,797 --> 00:27:31,290
<b>But I swear I didn't lie to you on purpose.</b>

290
00:27:31,299 --> 00:27:33,465
<b>It was tormenting for me, too.</b>

291
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:39,205
<b>You guys must be really good friends,</b>

292
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:42,170
<b>seeing that he even shared that kind of secret with you.</b>

293
00:27:42,177 --> 00:27:44,880
<b>I don't think of that jerk as my friend.</b>

294
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,975
<b>You're my friend.</b>

295
00:27:47,649 --> 00:27:49,315
<b>Really?</b>

296
00:27:49,518 --> 00:27:51,380
<b>Are you sure you're my friend?</b>

297
00:27:51,386 --> 00:27:53,115
<b>Of course.</b>

298
00:27:54,956 --> 00:27:58,255
<b>Then from now on, you'd better think before you act!</b>

299
00:28:20,182 --> 00:28:21,480
<b>What do you want?</b>

300
00:28:21,483 --> 00:28:23,875
<b>Did you safely take Joon Young home?</b>

01:06:55,128 --> 01:06:56,885
<b>I left, but...</b>

634
01:07:01,267 --> 01:07:04,225
<b>I'll stay in a spa for a few days...</b>

635
01:07:04,470 --> 01:07:06,165
<b>and then go back.</b>

636
01:07:10,843 --> 01:07:13,005
<b>Do you want...</b>

637
01:07:15,114 --> 01:07:16,905
<b>to waste your one and only life...</b>

638
01:07:17,617 --> 01:07:19,675
<b>because of a jerk like that?</b>

639
01:07:22,655 --> 01:07:25,515
<b>What if his life is totally dependent on me?</b>

640
01:07:28,061 --> 01:07:32,595
<b>No one would take him in other than me.</b>

641
01:07:34,767 --> 01:07:37,695
<b>He just takes it out on me now and then because life stinks.</b>

642
01:07:38,137 --> 01:07:40,195
<b>He's not a bad guy deep down.</b>

643
01:07:41,741 --> 01:07:45,435
<b>I'm going to make him a good guy.</b>

644
01:08:04,163 --> 01:08:06,695
<b>People don't change that easily.</b>

645
01:08:13,306 --> 01:08:16,635
<b>Didn't you ever think that he may kill you?</b>

646
01:08:21,547 --> 01:08:25,245
<b>It's because I love him.</b>

647
01:08:33,659 --> 01:08:35,325
<b>Here you go.</b>

648
01:08:39,899 --> 01:08:44,095
<b>Be careful not to get it infected before we take the stitches out.</b>

649
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:49,805
<b>Stay here for a few days.</b>

650
01:08:50,443 --> 01:08:52,675
<b>I'll find you a place to live.</b>

651
01:08:53,112 --> 01:08:55,705
<b>Don't even think about going back there.</b>

652
01:08:57,383 --> 01:08:59,115
<b>What about you?</b>

653
01:09:00,753 --> 01:09:02,485
<b>What...</b>

654
01:09:03,289 --> 01:09:05,415
<b>will you do now?</b>

655
01:09:11,931 --> 01:09:13,900
<b>- See you! - Bye!</b>

656
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:15,525
<b>Bye.</b>

657
01:09:15,902 --> 01:09:17,570
<b>I could've hit a home run.</b>

658
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:19,330
<b>You would not.</b>

659
01:09:19,338 --> 01:09:23,005
<b>- You would've struck out. - How dare you give me lip?</b>

660
01:09:23,042 --> 01:09:25,535
<b>- You punk. - That hurts.</b>

661
01:09:25,745 --> 01:09:28,545
<b>- Give up. - Fine, fine.</b>

662
01:09:29,348 --> 01:09:31,005
<b>Mom!</b>

663
01:09:42,461 --> 01:09:44,730
<b>You must have had fun. You look happy.</b>

664
01:09:44,730 --> 01:09:46,395
<b>Yes.</b>

665
01:09:47,033 --> 01:09:48,765
<b>How were you?</b>

666
01:09:48,901 --> 01:09:50,625
<b>Miss us?</b>

667
01:09:52,271 --> 01:09:53,935
<b>Welcome back.</b>

668
01:09:55,007 --> 01:09:57,040
<b>You were quick.</b>

669
01:09:57,043 --> 01:09:58,940
<b>I'm a pretty fast runner.</b>

670
01:09:58,945 --> 01:10:00,605
<b>Punk.</b>

671
01:10:00,846 --> 01:10:03,640
<b>- Still... Nice. - Yes.</b>

672
01:10:03,649 --> 01:10:06,110
<b>The steaks are here.</b>

673
01:10:06,118 --> 01:10:10,315
<b>Thank you for the food.</b>

674
01:10:10,523 --> 01:10:13,320
<b>- Cheers. - Cheers.</b>

675
01:10:13,326 --> 01:10:15,355
<b>I wish you good health.</b>

676
01:10:21,801 --> 01:10:25,970
<b>- I was playing catch with Hyun. - Okay.</b>

677
01:10:25,972 --> 01:10:30,300
<b>So... I threw it really hard, like this.</b>

678
01:10:30,309 --> 01:10:33,505
<b>- But he got hit. - Where?</b>

679
01:10:34,013 --> 01:10:35,805
<b>There?</b>

680
01:10:37,850 --> 01:10:41,385
<b>That must have hurt. What did he say?</b>

681
01:10:42,054 --> 01:10:44,820
<b>So that's why he was running all funky.</b>

682
01:10:44,824 --> 01:10:47,455
<b>- Right? - He looked awkward.</b>

683
01:10:47,860 --> 01:10:49,985
<b>He says his relationship is like wearing a mask.</b>

684
01:10:51,230 --> 01:10:53,595
<b>He says he's unhappy...</b>

685
01:10:53,699 --> 01:10:56,095
<b>because his marriage is nothing but a shell.</b>

686
01:10:57,136 --> 01:11:00,765
<b>Dad, let's play that baseball game after.</b>

687
01:11:00,940 --> 01:11:02,605
<b>Hey.</b>

688
01:11:02,808 --> 01:11:06,610
<b>Can we play a baseball game for just two hours after dinner?</b>

689
01:11:06,612 --> 01:11:07,840
<b>- No, just one. - Just for an hour.</b>

690
01:11:07,847 --> 01:11:09,410
<b>Can we play for an hour?</b>

691
01:11:09,415 --> 01:11:12,215
<b>- It'll only be for an hour. - Please.</b>

692
01:11:14,053 --> 01:11:15,620
<b>Gosh.</b>

693
01:11:15,621 --> 01:11:17,645
<b>- Yes! Okay! - Yes!</b>

694
01:11:18,858 --> 01:11:22,225
<b>- Hurry up and eat. - Okay.</b>

695
01:11:22,962 --> 01:11:24,795
<b>I love steak.</b>

696
01:11:26,866 --> 01:11:28,665
<b>It's so delicious.</b>

697
01:11:31,237 --> 01:11:35,005
<b>It's because I love him.</b>

698
01:11:53,693 --> 01:11:55,255
<b>(Pause)</b>

699
01:12:02,134 --> 01:12:03,765
<b>Who is that?</b>

700
01:12:30,930 --> 01:12:32,625
<b>Where's Joon Young?</b>

701
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:37,965
<b>He left a bit ago with his friend.</b>

702
01:12:57,089 --> 01:12:58,815
<b>Is work going well?</b>

703
01:12:59,091 --> 01:13:00,815
<b>The investor...</b>

704
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:04,455
<b>requested me to adjust the script.</b>

705
01:13:05,231 --> 01:13:07,555
<b>Aside from that headache, it's not bad.</b>

706
01:13:24,450 --> 01:13:26,045
<b>You have...</b>

707
01:13:28,621 --> 01:13:30,345
<b>another woman, don't you?</b>

708
01:13:36,162 --> 01:13:37,955
<b>What did you just say?</b>

709
01:13:39,031 --> 01:13:41,825
<b>I want you to tell me the truth.</b>

710
01:13:43,903 --> 01:13:46,565
<b>We talked about this when we first got married.</b>

711
01:13:46,839 --> 01:13:50,340
<b>We thought we might fancy other people after a while.</b>

712
01:13:50,342 --> 01:13:52,805
<b>We promised to be honest with each other if it ever happened.</b>

713
01:13:57,950 --> 01:13:59,675
<b>Do you remember that?</b>

714
01:14:00,986 --> 01:14:02,945
<b>If you admit to it...</b>

715
01:14:03,389 --> 01:14:05,715
<b>even now...</b>

716
01:14:08,327 --> 01:14:10,320
<b>and get yourself sorted out,</b>

717
01:14:10,329 --> 01:14:12,925
<b>I might be able to forgive you.</b>

718
01:14:18,771 --> 01:14:22,105
<b>For a moment, you were...</b>

719
01:14:23,375 --> 01:14:25,475
<b>just physically drawn to her.</b>

720
01:14:25,945 --> 01:14:27,505
<b>Right?</b>

721
01:14:37,523 --> 01:14:41,485
<b>Although it's just a fling, it's hard for me to endure.</b>

722
01:14:42,027 --> 01:14:45,895
<b>I bet I'll become dull about it one day since life is long.</b>

723
01:14:46,298 --> 01:14:48,825
<b>But, I can't forgive lies.</b>

724
01:14:50,369 --> 01:14:52,595
<b>Lying would be truly betraying me.</b>

725
01:14:55,541 --> 01:14:58,505
<b>So be honest with me.</b>

726
01:15:07,586 --> 01:15:09,215
<b>Are you...</b>

727
01:15:11,857 --> 01:15:13,685
<b>seeing another woman?</b>

728
01:15:18,163 --> 01:15:19,955
<b>Did you ask me if I'm seeing someone?</b>

729
01:15:22,001 --> 01:15:24,065
<b>Me? Cheat on you?</b>

730
01:15:25,004 --> 01:15:26,765
<b>I know you are.</b>

731
01:15:30,009 --> 01:15:32,810
<b>You did this last time too. What's the matter with you?</b>

732
01:15:32,811 --> 01:15:34,540
<b>There's no other woman.</b>

733
01:15:34,547 --> 01:15:36,340
<b>Please don't lie to me.</b>

734
01:15:36,348 --> 01:15:38,675
<b>Who do you take me for?</b>

735
01:15:39,285 --> 01:15:40,680
<b>Is this how weak our trust is?</b>

736
01:15:40,686 --> 01:15:42,680
<b>Stop lying to me!</b>

737
01:15:42,688 --> 01:15:45,715
<b>- Stop disappointing me! - It's me who's disappointed!</b>

738
01:15:45,925 --> 01:15:48,755
<b>How can I speak to you when you're not making any sense?</b>

739
01:15:49,995 --> 01:15:53,155
<b>I'm a busy guy. Why are you wasting my time?</b>

740
01:15:54,867 --> 01:15:56,525
<b>Gosh.</b>

<b>you're the only woman in my life. Don't you know that?</b>

745
01:16:20,092 --> 01:16:21,855

<b>Sure.</b>

748
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:48,415
<b>You must be right.</b>

<b>Are you okay?</b>

750
01:17:02,901 --> 01:17:04,995
<b>You just said...</b>

<b>I'm the only woman in your life.</b>

<b>That's good.</b>
