00:39:05,143 --> 00:39:06,520
<b>you won't be able to escape again.</b>

312
00:39:06,603 --> 00:39:07,938
<b>I won't get caught.</b>

313
00:40:40,697 --> 00:40:41,698
<b>He has no eyes.</b>

314
00:40:57,631 --> 00:40:59,299
<b>I'm grateful that you're keeping me safe,</b>

315
00:40:59,967 --> 00:41:03,261
<b>but you can't just ask me to perform
a secret operation.</b>

316
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:04,638
<b>You're still here</b>

317
00:41:04,721 --> 00:41:06,682
<b>despite everything you've gone through,</b>

318
00:41:06,807 --> 00:41:08,100
<b>so it can't be helped.</b>

319
00:41:09,059 --> 00:41:11,770
<b>He won't be receiving the surgery,
will he?</b>

320
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:16,191
<b>If he wants, then sure.</b>

321
00:41:16,274 --> 00:41:18,026
<b>Artificial eye surgery is still dangerous.</b>

322
00:41:18,902 --> 00:41:20,821
<b>It's practically an act of suicide.</b>

323
00:41:20,904 --> 00:41:23,657
<b>I promise to find
the abducted hospital staff members.</b>

324
00:41:28,078 --> 00:41:29,454
<b>Even if the surgery is a success,</b>

325
00:41:30,122 --> 00:41:32,416
<b>I'm not sure what kinds of side effects--</b>

326
00:41:32,499 --> 00:41:34,167
<b>Despite losing both of his eyes,</b>

327
00:41:34,334 --> 00:41:37,129
<b>there are people
who still want to kill him.</b>

328
00:41:37,546 --> 00:41:39,131
<b>He needs this.</b>

329
00:41:42,426 --> 00:41:44,428
<b>Gi-beom, are you awake?</b>

330
00:41:45,095 --> 00:41:46,388
<b>Mr. Earphone?</b>

331
00:41:46,930 --> 00:41:47,973
<b>That's me.</b>

332
00:41:48,765 --> 00:41:50,267
<b>Great job escaping.</b>

333
00:41:51,101 --> 00:41:52,269
<b>I haven't introduced myself.</b>

334
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:55,522
<b>I'm Police Chief Commissioner
Choi Geun-cheol.</b>

335
00:41:56,314 --> 00:41:57,649
<b>Mr. Choi.</b>

336
00:41:58,775 --> 00:41:59,609
<b>Where am I?</b>

337
00:42:00,944 --> 00:42:02,571
<b>This is K Hospital.</b>

338
00:42:03,697 --> 00:42:05,866
<b>The medical staff disappeared
into thin air,</b>

339
00:42:06,241 --> 00:42:07,743
<b>and the hospital shut down.</b>

340
00:42:08,452 --> 00:42:10,370
<b>I'm sure they're still alive</b>

341
00:42:10,787 --> 00:42:12,581
<b>since they're useful.</b>

342
00:42:13,165 --> 00:42:13,999
<b>Perhaps.</b>

343
00:42:15,333 --> 00:42:17,669
<b>However, you're different.</b>

344
00:42:18,712 --> 00:42:20,255
<b>As long as you're a target,</b>

345
00:42:20,839 --> 00:42:22,758
<b>Argos will continue to look for you.</b>

346
00:42:22,841 --> 00:42:25,844
<b>I'm sure you've come up
with some measures.</b>

347
00:42:25,927 --> 00:42:27,220
<b>Of course.</b>

348
00:42:28,096 --> 00:42:29,973
<b>After all, I'm the one who decided</b>

349
00:42:30,057 --> 00:42:32,601
<b>not to clear your name
regarding the murder.</b>

350
00:42:32,768 --> 00:42:34,269
<b>-What?
-Had you not been incarcerated,</b>

351
00:42:34,853 --> 00:42:36,688
<b>you would've died several times already.</b>

352
00:42:37,064 --> 00:42:40,067
<b>I take pride in saying that
this was the best way to protect you.</b>

353
00:42:40,275 --> 00:42:42,444
<b>I may be lying down like this,</b>

354
00:42:42,861 --> 00:42:44,821
<b>but you'll need to be honest with me.</b>

355
00:42:46,156 --> 00:42:48,825
<b>Why did you ruin my entire life
without my consent?</b>

356
00:42:49,409 --> 00:42:50,744
<b>To give your eyes back.</b>

357
00:42:51,495 --> 00:42:52,788
<b>I'll be able to see again?</b>

358
00:42:52,871 --> 00:42:54,581
<b>Yes, if the surgery is a success.</b>

359
00:42:55,332 --> 00:42:57,459
<b>And you'll have to become my agent.</b>

360
00:42:58,335 --> 00:42:59,169
<b>And then?</b>

361
00:43:00,796 --> 00:43:01,671
<b>Bring down Argos.</b>

362
00:43:03,381 --> 00:43:05,342
<b>Isn't that what we all desire?</b>

363
00:43:07,052 --> 00:43:09,179
<b>Will I truly be able to see again?</b>

364
00:43:10,472 --> 00:43:12,182
<b>If you accept my offer,</b>

365
00:43:12,849 --> 00:43:14,601
<b>you'll be declared dead</b>

366
00:43:14,851 --> 00:43:17,187
<b>at 9 p.m. tonight.</b>

367
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:20,190
<b>And then, you'll be born again.</b>

368
00:43:23,068 --> 00:43:24,611
<b>Where do we begin?</b>

369
00:43:29,616 --> 00:43:33,453
<b>I know you can't see,
but let me introduce the staff.</b>

370
00:43:33,537 --> 00:43:35,705
<b>This is Susan who's in charge
of bio parts.</b>

371
00:43:36,331 --> 00:43:39,417
<b>She studied medicine, but she's excellent
at programming as well.</b>

372
00:43:39,501 --> 00:43:40,710
<b>Hello.</b>

373
00:43:40,794 --> 00:43:41,920
<b>It's nice to meet you.</b>

374
00:43:42,504 --> 00:43:43,797
<b>And this is Bradley.</b>

375
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,257
<b>He's a mechanic.</b>

376
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:48,009
<b>I have nothing else to say
but that he's a genius.</b>

377
00:43:48,718 --> 00:43:49,719
<b>That's true.</b>

378
00:43:50,303 --> 00:43:51,471
<b>Thank you for doing this.</b>

379
00:43:51,972 --> 00:43:54,933
<b>We've been through
countless trials and errors.</b>

380
00:43:55,225 --> 00:43:59,062
<b>As a result, we've created
much advanced artificial eyes.</b>

381
00:43:59,396 --> 00:44:02,023
<b>And you're our first test subject.</b>

382
00:44:02,691 --> 00:44:06,069
<b>Could you address me as something else
other than "test subject"?</b>

383
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:08,155
<b>You'll become a cutting-edge,
integrated AI</b>

384
00:44:08,238 --> 00:44:10,574
<b>that can be weaponized as well.</b>

385
00:44:11,908 --> 00:44:13,660
<b>In other words,
you'll become a human weapon.</b>

386
00:44:14,244 --> 00:44:15,495
<b>Human weapon?</b>

387
00:44:17,247 --> 00:44:18,582
<b>That's not bad.</b>

388
00:44:19,207 --> 00:44:20,292
<b>Let's begin.</b>

389
00:45:48,046 --> 00:45:49,506
<b>This hurts so much.</b>

390
00:45:50,382 --> 00:45:51,341
<b>Is anyone there?</b>

391
00:45:52,676 --> 00:45:55,428
<b>Gi-beom, you need to relax.</b>

392
00:46:28,378 --> 00:46:30,380
<b>-Hello, sir.
-Hello, sir.</b>

393
00:46:34,592 --> 00:46:36,928
<b>We need to kill him at all costs.</b>

394
00:46:38,054 --> 00:46:39,597
<b>Thanks to your men's incompetence,</b>

395
00:46:39,681 --> 00:46:41,433
<b>he got away twice.</b>

396
00:46:41,683 --> 00:46:42,726
<b>Once from his house</b>

397
00:46:42,809 --> 00:46:44,644
<b>and once from the penitentiary.</b>

398
00:46:44,728 --> 00:46:46,479
<b>I want solid proof.</b>

399
00:46:46,730 --> 00:46:48,565
<b>My men picked this up</b>

400
00:46:49,065 --> 00:46:50,567
<b>from the place where he was found dead.</b>

401
00:46:56,448 --> 00:46:57,615
<b>-Did you see it?
-Sorry?</b>

402
00:46:58,199 --> 00:47:00,285
<b>What do you mean?</b>

403
00:47:00,368 --> 00:47:03,288
<b>Did you see his body with your own eyes?</b>

404
00:47:03,371 --> 00:47:04,414
<b>I...</b>

405
00:47:04,706 --> 00:47:05,957
<b>I didn't.</b>

406
00:47:06,124 --> 00:47:09,002
<b>But he was declared dead
at 9 p.m. that night.</b>

407
00:47:09,586 --> 00:47:11,046
<b>-Are you sure?
-I'm positive.</b>

408
00:47:19,971 --> 00:47:21,181
<b>Excuse us, sir.</b>

409
00:47:28,688 --> 00:47:30,398
<b>Where's Hwang Deuk-gu?</b>

410
00:47:32,317 --> 00:47:34,652
<b>The future of our organization
is taking place here.</b>

411
00:47:34,736 --> 00:47:36,613
<b>So where the hell is he?</b>

412
00:47:39,574 --> 00:47:41,326
<b>I'm here.</b>

413
00:47:41,826 --> 00:47:43,620
<b>I'm not late either.</b>

414
00:47:43,703 --> 00:47:46,456
<b>Do you think the rest of them
have nothing to do?</b>

415
00:47:56,466 --> 00:47:57,467
<b>Bring me some wine.</b>

416
00:47:59,219 --> 00:48:01,304
<b>I don't have much of an appetite.</b>

417
00:48:12,065 --> 00:48:13,983
<b>This baby is excellent.</b>

418
00:48:14,859 --> 00:48:19,072
<b>This is to celebrate your entering
into the political world.</b>

419
00:48:20,073 --> 00:48:22,117
<b>You always need to stand out, don't you?</b>

420
00:48:24,494 --> 00:48:25,912
<b>I was scared of him</b>

421
00:48:25,995 --> 00:48:28,790
<b>and felt reluctant
about going into politics.</b>

422
00:48:32,419 --> 00:48:34,212
<b>I can't believe
the most powerful individual</b>

423
00:48:34,295 --> 00:48:35,839
<b>is afraid of something.</b>

424
00:48:37,298 --> 00:48:38,591
<b>That can't be.</b>

425
00:48:40,009 --> 00:48:42,971
<b>Hierarchy exists for a reason.</b>

426
00:48:46,224 --> 00:48:48,560
<b>I'm afraid that loutish son of a bitch</b>

427
00:48:48,643 --> 00:48:50,645
<b>might cause trouble.</b>

428
00:48:51,104 --> 00:48:53,231
<b>Reputation is everything in politics.</b>

429
00:48:53,314 --> 00:48:57,277
<b>Everything I do is for you.</b>

430
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:01,739
<b>All right.</b>

431
00:49:02,157 --> 00:49:03,199
<b>Listen up.</b>

432
00:49:04,742 --> 00:49:07,912
<b>There's legislation, jurisdiction,
and administration.</b>

433
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:11,916
<b>On top of them, I'm going to place Argos.</b>

434
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:15,253
<b>From now on, I'm going to define</b>

435
00:49:15,837 --> 00:49:17,422
<b>what's good or bad</b>

436
00:49:17,505 --> 00:49:18,840
<b>and what's filthy or clean.</b>

437
00:49:21,968 --> 00:49:24,345
<b>That is right. You are truly amazing.</b>

438
00:49:25,263 --> 00:49:28,266
<b>You have to take control over Argos
for as long as possible.</b>

439
00:49:28,349 --> 00:49:30,477
<b>We don't need no successor.</b>

440
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:31,644
<b>He's right.</b>

441
00:49:31,978 --> 00:49:35,315
<b>We will always have a place for you.</b>

442
00:49:38,234 --> 00:49:41,446
<b>In two weeks,
Ye-won and I will get married.</b>

443
00:49:42,030 --> 00:49:45,241
<b>A remarried politician is better
than a divorced one.</b>

444
00:49:45,492 --> 00:49:48,244
<b>It looks hopeful. Don't you think so?</b>

445
00:49:48,328 --> 00:49:49,204
<b>Of course.</b>

446
00:50:02,008 --> 00:50:05,803
<b>Everything I do is for you.
You know that, right?</b>

447
00:50:28,368 --> 00:50:29,202
<b>Jin.</b>

448
00:50:33,122 --> 00:50:34,123
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

449
00:50:38,044 --> 00:50:39,796
<b>Don't cry, Gi-beom.</b>

450
00:50:44,467 --> 00:50:45,552
<b>There's no point in crying.</b>

451
00:50:51,224 --> 00:50:52,642
<b>It's already too late.</b>

452
00:50:57,939 --> 00:50:59,065
<b>Jin.</b>

453
00:51:30,638 --> 00:51:31,639
<b>Gi-beom.</b>

454
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:33,308
<b>Are you okay?</b>

455
00:51:49,365 --> 00:51:50,408
<b>Get rid of that knife.</b>

456
00:51:51,909 --> 00:51:52,910
<b>I don't want to see it.</b>

457
00:54:00,329 --> 00:54:01,539
<b>I really can see.</b>

458
00:55:13,778 --> 00:55:15,279
<b>Hey, do you work here?</b>

459
00:55:17,907 --> 00:55:18,741
<b>You opened your eyes.</b>

460
00:55:18,825 --> 00:55:19,826
<b>Do you know me?</b>

461
00:55:21,035 --> 00:55:21,953
<b>We're on the same team.</b>

462
00:55:22,537 --> 00:55:23,746
<b>What do you mean?</b>

463
00:55:23,830 --> 00:55:25,706
<b>I'm in charge of Gi-beom.</b>

464
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:29,961
<b>Watch out.</b>

465
00:55:34,715 --> 00:55:36,217
<b>It's been a while.</b>

466
00:55:37,134 --> 00:55:38,135

<b>You thought I died, right?</b>

<b>Or am I suffering from aftereffects

<b>No, you're not.</b>

472

<b>I even went to your funeral.</b>

491
00:56:47,955 --> 00:56:49,874
<b>Are you still in pain

<b>Whether it's truly a relief
