<b>10 boxes each of essentials and medical kits?</b>

2
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:10,230
<b>Yes.</b>

3
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:12,130
<b>Make it quick.</b>

4
00:00:12,271 --> 00:00:14,841
<b>I'm busy. I need to go catch someone.</b>

5
00:00:14,941 --> 00:00:18,711
<b>No. This jerk threw a fit saying he needs the studio, but flaked.</b>

6
00:00:18,711 --> 00:00:21,911
<b>He won't answer his phone either. I have to find him.</b>

7
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,650
<b>Fruit. Okay. Is that all?</b>

8
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:26,810
<b>Okay.</b>

9
00:00:27,621 --> 00:00:29,350
<b>When are you coming home, Grandma?</b>

10
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,591
<b>Do you like it there that much? Do you like it more than me?</b>

11
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:34,490
<b>How could you?</b>

12
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,731
<b>She's too old to be doing this.</b>

13
00:00:45,731 --> 00:00:49,070
<b>You should tell her to come home. She listens to you.</b>

14
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:50,841
<b>I'm so worried.</b>

15
00:00:50,871 --> 00:00:53,841
<b>Okay. I'll try talking to her.</b>

16
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:55,780
<b>Don't worry.</b>

17
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:57,350
<b>Why do you sound so dejected?</b>

18
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:00,750
<b>I'll email you the list of stuff Grandma says she needs.</b>

19
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,750
<b>It's so noisy there. Where are you?</b>

20
00:01:05,621 --> 00:01:06,791
<b>Outside.</b>

21
00:01:07,321 --> 00:01:08,560
<b>Outside where?</b>

22
00:01:08,621 --> 00:01:10,461
<b>You know where you are, right?</b>

23
00:01:10,461 --> 00:01:13,431
<b>Don't space out and end up somewhere strange.</b>

24
00:01:16,261 --> 00:01:17,701
<b>Soon Ho.</b>

25
00:01:19,631 --> 00:01:21,440
<b>Why is it so hard?</b>

26
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,341
<b>You never say things are hard.</b>

27
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,610
<b>Seo Woo. Where were you?</b>

28
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:31,011
<b>I didn't see you.</b>

29
00:01:31,351 --> 00:01:33,250
<b>Anyway, Kang In Wook isn't here.</b>

30
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,520
<b>- I'll call him. - He won't pick up.</b>

31
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,181
<b>That jerk.</b>

32
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:38,651
<b>Maybe he has plans.</b>

33
00:01:38,651 --> 00:01:40,821
<b>No. That jerk just left.</b>

34
00:01:40,821 --> 00:01:42,991
<b>He couldn't wait a few minutes.</b>

35
00:01:42,991 --> 00:01:45,030
<b>I'm going to catch him.</b>

36
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,791
<b>May I go home?</b>

37
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:47,931
<b>Sure.</b>

38
00:01:50,461 --> 00:01:52,071
<b>Something's up, isn't it?</b>

39
00:01:57,511 --> 00:01:58,810
<b>Are you at the studio?</b>

40
00:01:58,810 --> 00:01:59,841
<b>Yes.</b>

41
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,440
<b>I came out for a bit.</b>

42
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,451
<b>Why?</b>

43
00:02:05,351 --> 00:02:07,250
<b>I got the best sleep there recently.</b>

44
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,920
<b>What's wrong with your apartment?</b>

45
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,180
<b>Fine.</b>

46
00:02:10,451 --> 00:02:13,090
<b>Seriously. He doesn't need an apartment.</b>

47
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,460
<b>I should take it.</b>

48
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,691
<b>Weren't you leaving?</b>

49
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:21,430
<b>I'll open the studio and then go.</b>

50
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,900
<b>Okay. Bye.</b>

51
00:02:23,731 --> 00:02:26,370
<b>Kang In Wook. I'm so annoyed.</b>

52
00:02:26,731 --> 00:02:30,201
<b>I ran out without even washing my face.</b>

53
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:59,261
<b>Stop it.</b>

54
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:03,061
<b>Stop your neverending unrequited love.</b>

55
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,731
<b>That's right. You said you didn't know...</b>

56
00:04:06,731 --> 00:04:09,041
<b>what it means to stop and why you should, right?</b>

57
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:12,041
<b>My unrequited love...</b>

58
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:14,640
<b>has at least one percent chance.</b>

59
00:04:15,381 --> 00:04:17,410
<b>Who says I have one percent?</b>

60
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,580
<b>You're alive.</b>

61
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:25,251
<b>You don't even have one percent.</b>

62
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,921
<b>So stop it.</b>

63
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,160
<b>I'm sorry, but...</b>

64
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:33,061
<b>So I'll stop too.</b>

65
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:37,030
<b>I'm stopping because I have only one percent. You...</b>

66
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,631
<b>You should've stopped a while ago.</b>

67
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:07,261
<b>Did you turn on the music?</b>

68
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,830
<b>The music there is supposedly good for falling asleep.</b>

69
00:05:19,371 --> 00:05:21,741
<b>Sleep well.</b>

70
00:05:57,441 --> 00:06:00,980
<b>(A Piece of Your Mind)</b>

<b>(Episode 6)</b>

72
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,691
<b>Did you come out to greet me?</b>

73
00:06:08,821 --> 00:06:10,160
<b>You had dinner, right?</b>

74
00:06:10,321 --> 00:06:13,290
<b>Yes. You must have known I had a rough day.</b>

75
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:15,301
<b>This is nice.</b>

76
00:06:15,431 --> 00:06:17,600
<b>- You had a rough day again? - Yes.</b>

77
00:06:18,431 --> 00:06:20,201
<b>A new roomie is moving in today.</b>

78
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,501
<b>Since when were we "roomies"?</b>

79
00:06:23,501 --> 00:06:25,611
<b>Everyone but you two are roomies.</b>

80
00:06:25,611 --> 00:06:26,970
<b>I don't want to care about them.</b>

81
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:29,611
<b>A "roomie" sounds distant.</b>

82
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,251
<b>Here he is.</b>

83
00:06:41,921 --> 00:06:44,330
<b>Are you Bae Jin Soo?</b>

84
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:48,001
<b>Hello. I'm Bae Jin Soo.</b>

85
00:06:48,001 --> 00:06:50,931
<b>You're wearing a puffer in April.</b>

86
00:06:50,931 --> 00:06:52,270
<b>Is this everything?</b>

87
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,970
<b>The performance... I'm sure that was you.</b>

88
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:00,410
<b>I was in our med school orchestra.</b>

89
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:01,881
<b>Is this everything?</b>

90
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,741
<b>It will be delivered tomorrow.</b>

91
00:07:03,741 --> 00:07:04,780
<b>I see.</b>

92
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,051
<b>Gosh, your lab coat is so dirty.</b>

93
00:07:08,051 --> 00:07:10,280
<b>Take it off as soon as you come in. I'll wash it for you.</b>

94
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,051
<b>A doctor's lab coat should be clean.</b>

95
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,621
<b>I'm just a student.</b>

96
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:20,390
<b>Suna in Senegal became a swimmer.</b>

97
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,600
<b>She used to be so weak. I'm proud of her.</b>

98
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:25,470
<b>I guess you're down about something,</b>

99
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:27,970
<b>seeing how you called me and are reading letters.</b>

100
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:31,811
<b>You got me.</b>

101
00:07:33,811 --> 00:07:36,381
<b>Read anything at a time like that.</b>

102
00:07:36,681 --> 00:07:39,280
<b>It will all be helpful to you guys.</b>

103
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:42,580
<b>That is why I've had them addressed to you,</b>

104
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:45,090
<b>but Soon Ho never reads any of them.</b>

105
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:47,251
<b>She must never get sad.</b>

106
00:07:47,991 --> 00:07:49,160
<b>That's a good thing.</b>

107
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:53,090
<b>When are you coming back? Soon Ho is worried about you.</b>

108
00:07:53,761 --> 00:07:55,830
<b>I'll be back when the time comes.</b>

109
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,371
<b>Tell her that I'll be there before the weather gets hot.</b>

110
00:07:58,671 --> 00:08:01,071
<b>I can't bear the hot weather here either.</b>

111
00:08:02,701 --> 00:08:04,040
<b>I'm excited already.</b>

112
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,340
<b>(4am)</b>

113
00:08:19,551 --> 00:08:21,821
<b>(4:02am)</b>

00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:39,271
<b>A single leaf</b>

115

<b>Lands on the shoulder</b>

116
00:08:46,181 --> 00:08:47,350
<b>Well...</b>

117
00:08:48,321 --> 00:08:49,480
<b>I was curious.</b>

118
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,391
<b>About what?</b>

119
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,360
<b>Kim Ji Soo.</b>

120
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:58,360
<b>Moon Ha Won's fixed point.</b>

121
00:09:01,561 --> 00:09:04,531
<b>The coordinate center that remains no matter how distorted it gets.</b>

122
00:09:04,531 --> 00:09:07,470
<b>The desperation that raises his technical skills to the extreme.</b>

123
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:09,340
<b>Could it be this person?</b>

124
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,340
<b>If then,</b>

125
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,811
<b>every research would've started with Kim Ji Soo.</b>

126
00:09:14,811 --> 00:09:16,610
<b>Kim Ji Soo's device has been tested.</b>

127
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:18,580
<b>A hint about the next stage might be in here.</b>

128
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:21,421
<b>Delete it. Delete everything in front of me.</b>

129
00:09:25,551 --> 00:09:26,590
<b>Right...</b>

130
00:09:28,161 --> 00:09:29,220
<b>now.</b>

131
00:09:35,801 --> 00:09:38,830
<b>(Deleting)</b>

132
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:40,701
<b>It's done.</b>

133
00:09:43,441 --> 00:09:45,370
<b>- I just don't understand. - Of course.</b>

134
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:48,041
<b>It must be so frustrating...</b>

135
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:50,281
<b>because you can't understand even with your smart brain.</b>

136
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,250
<b>You don't have to stay.</b>

137
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,951
<b>There. Go there.</b>

138
00:09:53,951 --> 00:09:55,151
<b>The R2 Team.</b>

139
00:09:55,151 --> 00:09:57,281
<b>Right, you know. Go to that team.</b>

140
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,250
<b>They'll love it if you go there.</b>

141
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:02,960
<b>No. I won't go anywhere without Moon Ha Won and Kim Hoon.</b>

<b>Who is Kim Ji Soo? Who is she?</b>

143
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:06,630
<b>I'm not even interested.</b>

144
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,330
<b>Don't be.</b>

145
00:10:16,901 --> 00:10:19,271
<b>Jin Hwan, this punk, has good deduction skills.</b>

146
00:10:19,271 --> 00:10:20,840
<b>He's a smart punk.</b>

147
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,610
<b>The fixed point will never change.</b>

148
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:26,480
<b>But it has to satisfy Lefschetz's conditions.</b>

149
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,380
<b>And it reacts only...</b>

150

<b>The capillaries in your eyes are about to burst.</b>

154

<b>Do you have insomnia again?</b>

155
00:10:48,301 --> 00:10:50,240
<b>You need to sleep.</b>

<b>Jin Soo, do you eat breakfast?</b>

<b>You must be tired.</b>

<b>Take it off.</b>

161
00:11:10,891 --> 00:11:12,130
<b>- Goodness. - What are you...</b>

162
00:11:13,391 --> 00:11:15,000
<b>I'll take it off of him. Seriously.</b>

163
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,201
<b>- My gosh! - What...</b>

164
00:11:17,201 --> 00:11:19,431
<b>- Let's do it together. - Gosh.</b>

165
00:11:20,401 --> 00:11:22,201
<b>Gosh, Jin Soo. Oh no.</b>

166
00:11:22,201 --> 00:11:24,510
<b>Goodness, what's wrong with you?</b>

167
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:28,311
<b>Look how dirty this is. I need to wash it again.</b>

168
00:11:33,311 --> 00:11:36,151
<b>Mr. Choi, where's Mr. Kang?</b>

169
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:40,321
<b>I've known In Wook for a long time.</b>

170
00:11:41,051 --> 00:11:44,260
<b>It was his first chance to record an album with a major label.</b>

171
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:47,630
<b>But then he was struck with a slump and a sense of betrayal.</b>

172
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:51,031
<b>He isn't in his right mind now.</b>

173
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,271
<b>He can do it alone.</b>

174
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,340
<b>What...</b>

175
00:11:57,041 --> 00:12:00,041
<b>I mean, your answer is too creative.</b>

176
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:02,710
<b>You want to record yourself when your skills are at its highest.</b>

177
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,510
<b>Not when it's at the lowest.</b>

178
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:08,380
<b>Then he can set a goal and improve his skills.</b>

179
00:12:08,921 --> 00:12:10,620
<b>It's easier said than done.</b>

180
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:13,521
<b>All right, let's do that. Will you?</b>

181
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:15,891
<b>Everything survives as long as its roots aren't dead.</b>

182
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,360
<b>Where's Mr. Kang?</b>

183
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:20,460
<b>In the studio.</b>

184
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,061
<b>Goodness, really?</b>

185
00:12:56,301 --> 00:12:58,901
<b>- Hello, Mr. Kang. - Turn off the light.</b>

186
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:01,641
<b>Don't you have something to say to me?</b>

187
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,671
<b>- What? - Gosh.</b>

188
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:07,980
<b>I mean, yesterday. You demanded that I open the studio...</b>

189
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,380
<b>out of the blue.</b>

190
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,411
<b>I ran over like a crazy person.</b>

191
00:13:11,411 --> 00:13:12,781
<b>How long was I supposed to wait then?</b>

192
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:16,080
<b>- Couldn't you wait 10 minutes? - I waited for 20 minutes.</b>

193
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,850
<b>That's the same thing.</b>

194
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:20,990
<b>You should've left a text if you weren't going to wait.</b>

195
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:22,661
<b>Turn off the light and get out.</b>

196
00:13:22,661 --> 00:13:24,561
<b>I'm getting to my point now.</b>

197
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:27,830
<b>Moon Studio is the best for overcoming a slump.</b>

198
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:29,201
<b>You know that?</b>

199
00:13:30,301 --> 00:13:32,431
<b>You can record yourself alone and release an album.</b>

200
00:13:32,431 --> 00:13:33,801
<b>What's the problem?</b>

201
00:13:33,801 --> 00:13:35,470
<b>My studio will give you full support...</b>

202
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:37,071
<b>including Han Seo Woo.</b>

203
00:13:37,071 --> 00:13:39,370
<b>You just need to make up your mind.</b>

204
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,141
<b>You have my business card, right?</b>

205
00:13:43,141 --> 00:13:45,651
<b>- I gave you my business card. - I said, no!</b>

206
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,681
<b>Good. Yell. You finally seem human.</b>

207
00:13:51,821 --> 00:13:52,990
<b>Call me.</b>

208
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:09,071
<b>I found Kang In Wook and gave him a sales pitch too.</b>

209
00:14:09,071 --> 00:14:11,771
<b>- Did you check the timetable? - No.</b>

210
00:14:14,071 --> 00:14:16,340
<b>Did you sleep at your place in Seoul?</b>

211
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:18,750
<b>Do I have a place in Seoul?</b>

212
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,480
<b>Where you passed out after getting plastered.</b>

213
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,281
<b>That's not my place.</b>

214
00:14:23,451 --> 00:14:26,051
<b>Wait, I should just live there.</b>

215
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,391
<b>Someone already lives there.</b>

216
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,421
<b>I can make it mine.</b>

217
00:14:31,191 --> 00:14:34,330
<b>What about the person who lives there? You shouldn't do that.</b>

218
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:37,100
<b>It's only a small family issue. Did you check the timetable?</b>

219
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,531
<b>I'm on my way to look at it.</b>

220
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:41,201
<b>Don't go. It's for a voice recording.</b>

221
00:14:44,201 --> 00:14:45,840
<b>- That... - Yes.</b>

222
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:48,610
<b>It's like Kim Ji Soo. You don't want to do it, do you?</b>

223
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:52,181
<b>Let's just check the time and hand it over to someone else.</b>

224
00:14:52,181 --> 00:14:54,380
<b>- We just lend them the studio. - I'll do it.</b>

225
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:04,391
<b>(12-9 Sejong-ro, Jongno-gu, Seoul)</b>

226
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:14,171
<b>Hello.</b>

227
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:18,510
<b>Can I take photos to post on my social media page?</b>

228
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,041
<b>I was given this address.</b>

229

<b>Give me the room at the end if I decide to move in.</b>

230

<b>Excuse me, your face.</b>

231
00:15:27,311 --> 00:15:28,781
<b>You're still in it.</b>

232

<b>From simple consonants and vowels to sentences.</b>

233
00:15:42,061 --> 00:15:43,630
<b>Do I just read it?</b>

234
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:46,000
<b>Yes, if you want to stop in the middle,</b>

235
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,370
<b>just say stop. It will all be recorded.</b>

236
00:15:49,571 --> 00:15:51,571
<b>I hear it lets me have conversations with myself.</b>

237
00:15:51,911 --> 00:15:53,740
<b>Is there really a machine like that?</b>

238
00:15:54,311 --> 00:15:55,441
<b>Have you seen it?</b>

239
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:59,681
<b>I'm not allowed to say anything about recordings.</b>

240

<b>Ha Won is Ha Won.</b>

316
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:37,471
<b>Leave your one percent as is. Let it be free.</b>

317
00:22:41,141 --> 00:22:43,040
<b>Don't kill it yourself.</b>

318
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:51,911
<b>Ha Won will do as you said,</b>

319
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:53,750
<b>so you don't need to show him an example.</b>

320
00:22:59,421 --> 00:23:01,191
<b>Just so you know.</b>

321
00:23:01,891 --> 00:23:03,931
<b>This is your time slot,</b>

322
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:07,131
<b>so clean up after you're done.</b>

323
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,371
<b>Don't touch my stuff without permission.</b>

324
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,800
<b>My bag...</b>

325
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:13,941
<b>Do I keep the door open?</b>

326
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:17,510
<b>Close it.</b>

327
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:13,600
<b>It's dark. I thought you'd be scared.</b>

328
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,270
<b>Where's Chang Sup?</b>

329
00:24:55,711 --> 00:24:58,611
<b>He has a family matter and is spending the night there.</b>

330
00:24:58,611 --> 00:24:59,881
<b>That's unusual.</b>

331
00:25:01,411 --> 00:25:02,881
<b>Come home late tomorrow.</b>

332
00:25:02,881 --> 00:25:03,911
<b>Why?</b>

333
00:25:05,481 --> 00:25:08,221
<b>He has the day off tomorrow.</b>

334
00:25:09,391 --> 00:25:11,590
<b>Why are you so dense?</b>

335
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:13,990
<b>Oh, okay.</b>

336
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:16,131
<b>Enjoy your sweet time alone.</b>

337
00:25:18,231 --> 00:25:21,600
<b>Why don't you move upstairs? We have a vacant room.</b>

338
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,901
<b>I'll give you a discount.</b>

339
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:25,500
<b>Not yet.</b>

340
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,070
<b>Eun Joo.</b>

341
00:25:29,971 --> 00:25:31,810
<b>Is one percent...</b>

342
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:35,080
<b>potential or false hope?</b>

343
00:25:36,611 --> 00:25:40,050
<b>If you think, "I have a whole percent,"</b>

344
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:41,580
<b>it's potential.</b>

345
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:44,721
<b>If you think, "I only have one percent," it's false hope.</b>

346
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:47,790
<b>What is it about?</b>

347
00:25:48,661 --> 00:25:49,931
<b>My crush.</b>

348
00:25:51,931 --> 00:25:54,000
<b>Just do it by yourself as you have been.</b>

349
00:25:54,631 --> 00:25:55,971
<b>I'm going to throw it out there.</b>

350
00:25:59,671 --> 00:26:01,901
<b>I'll throw my one percent out there,</b>

351
00:26:02,611 --> 00:26:07,141
<b>and watch how it survives, whether it survives,</b>

352
00:26:07,481 --> 00:26:10,651
<b>or whether it crawls and falls flat on its face.</b>

353
00:26:11,651 --> 00:26:12,951
<b>I'll use tough love.</b>

354
00:26:13,181 --> 00:26:15,280
<b>Are you saying you'll do it or not?</b>

355
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,070
<b>(Mr. Kang)</b>

356
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:39,010
<b>Sweetie.</b>

357
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:41,881
<b>Sweetie. Mr. Kang says he'll work on the album with you.</b>

358
00:26:42,951 --> 00:26:44,280
<b>I proposed that.</b>

359
00:26:44,881 --> 00:26:45,981
<b>Me.</b>

360
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:01,030
<b>Mr. Kang, this is Han Seo Woo.</b>

361
00:27:01,201 --> 00:27:03,201
<b>I heard from Ms. Moon.</b>

362
00:27:03,201 --> 00:27:05,770
<b>I'll do my best. I'll see you this afternoon.</b>

363
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:08,171
<b>(I'll do my best. I'll see you this afternoon.)</b>

364
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,121
<b>Why did Ji Soo have Han Seo Woo's number?</b>

365
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,050
<b>Why Han Seo Woo?</b>

366
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:43,770
<b>(Choi Soo Ji)</b>

367
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,050
<b>What's up?</b>

368
00:27:59,191 --> 00:28:03,560
<b>It was nice when you got free breakfast every morning, right?</b>

369
00:28:04,731 --> 00:28:05,861
<b>How have you been?</b>

370
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:08,530
<b>Why are you asking? You don't care.</b>

371
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:10,070
<b>I asked to be polite.</b>

372
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:14,941
<b>- Why are you eating breakfast? - I pulled an all-nighter.</b>

373
00:28:15,471 --> 00:28:17,740
<b>Are things going well with Eun Joo?</b>

374
00:28:18,141 --> 00:28:19,780
<b>Like you care.</b>

375
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,040
<b>Forget it then.</b>

376
00:28:24,711 --> 00:28:25,721
<b>What's wrong?</b>

377
00:28:26,451 --> 00:28:29,191
<b>Seeing you suffer after leaving because of me...</b>

378
00:28:29,621 --> 00:28:30,921
<b>- breaks my heart. - What?</b>

379
00:28:30,921 --> 00:28:33,520
<b>Be honest. You liked me, right?</b>

380
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,090
<b>That's why you got mad and moved out.</b>

381
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:37,191
<b>You're delusional.</b>

382
00:28:37,191 --> 00:28:41,161
<b>A lot of women at work like me too.</b>

383
00:28:41,431 --> 00:28:44,600
<b>I'm one of those guys that get more attractive with age.</b>

384
00:28:45,131 --> 00:28:47,641
<b>This chest is a perfect fit for suits.</b>

385
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,740
<b>Having my status change overnight...</b>

386
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,040
<b>made me reflect back on whether I made the right choice.</b>

387
00:28:55,211 --> 00:28:56,310
<b>Why you...</b>

388
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:58,681
<b>- I said I'd kill you... - Hey.</b>

389
00:28:58,681 --> 00:29:02,181
<b>Underwear, socks, shirt...</b>

390
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,570
<b>I rented the room at the end.</b>

391
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:24,971
<b>I wanted to move in today.</b>

392
00:29:25,371 --> 00:29:26,441
<b>Rent?</b>

393
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,840
<b>I never rented it out.</b>

394
00:29:30,651 --> 00:29:33,681
<b>Hey, you. That guy took my deposit.</b>

395
00:29:33,681 --> 00:29:36,350
<b>That Chang Sup guy. How dare you try to con me?</b>

396
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:38,191
<b>Didn't you get the deposit?</b>

397
00:29:38,191 --> 00:29:41,121
<b>What?</b>

398
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:45,290
<b>I did it.</b>

399
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:47,530
<b>I deposited it into your account.</b>

400
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:48,631
<b>Check it.</b>

401
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:51,201
<b>She said she doesn't eat breakfast.</b>

402
00:29:51,371 --> 00:29:53,340
<b>Why did you take in a tenant?</b>

403
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:55,300
<b>I was helping. Why are you whining?</b>

404
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,941
<b>I need to screen the people first.</b>

405
00:29:57,941 --> 00:29:59,711
<b>Since when did you care about their personalities?</b>

406
00:29:59,711 --> 00:30:01,740
<b>I worked so hard!</b>

407
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:03,711
<b>Darn it.</b>

408
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:07,850
<b>What...</b>

409
00:30:08,881 --> 00:30:10,721
<b>Darn it!</b>

410
00:30:20,901 --> 00:30:21,931
<b>Hello.</b>

411
00:30:22,871 --> 00:30:23,901
<b>Were you...</b>

412
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,701
<b>the one that called...</b>

413
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,901
<b>- Let's go. - Okay.</b>

414
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:40,280
<b>I said I wanted the room at the end of the hall.</b>

415
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,520
<b>When?</b>

416
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:45,990
<b>I said over and over again that I wanted the room at the end.</b>

417
00:30:48,121 --> 00:30:49,161
<b>But...</b>

418
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:52,830
<b>When? How many times?</b>

419
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:54,931
<b>I told that girl at the studio!</b>

420
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:01,441
<b>Given what it is, just leave.</b>

421
00:31:01,441 --> 00:31:02,941
<b>Someone is already in the room at the end, so leave.</b>

422
00:31:02,941 --> 00:31:04,411
<b>I'll return the deposit.</b>

423
00:31:04,411 --> 00:31:05,611
<b>I won't go.</b>

424
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,580
<b>I won't budge until you give me the room at the end.</b>

425
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:13,350
<b>I told the girl at the studio that I wanted this room.</b>

426
00:31:16,151 --> 00:31:19,490
<b>The girl at the studio, so Seo woo.</b>

427
00:31:22,691 --> 00:31:24,090
<b>Let me check first.</b>

428
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:32,901
<b>Why aren't you picking up?</b>

429
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:35,810
<b>Pick up. Pick up, Seo Woo...</b>

430
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:39,441
<b>Seo Woo. Seo Woo, you'd better pick up!</b>

431
00:31:39,441 --> 00:31:43,651
<b>Pick up!</b>

432
00:31:44,151 --> 00:31:49,891
<b>Pick up!</b>

433
00:32:22,651 --> 00:32:23,790
<b>Hello.</b>

434
00:32:27,391 --> 00:32:29,090
<b>Let's talk comfortably today.</b>

435
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:31,090
<b>Let's record a few songs as practice.</b>

436
00:32:31,691 --> 00:32:34,030
<b>I hope I do a good job. It's my first time, so...</b>

437
00:32:37,701 --> 00:32:39,641
<b>Mr. Kang, who is he?</b>

438
00:32:40,471 --> 00:32:42,100
<b>He's my engineer.</b>

439
00:32:48,481 --> 00:32:51,651
<b>Ms. Moon told me you'd be working with me.</b>

440
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:55,891
<b>If you'd explain...</b>

441
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:57,891
<b>I never said I'd work with you.</b>

442
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:01,020
<b>Close the door behind you.</b>

443
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:17,171
<b>- Where are you going? - I'm going home early.</b>

444
00:33:17,171 --> 00:33:18,441
<b>You can't go.</b>

445
00:33:19,281 --> 00:33:21,381
<b>He brought another engineer.</b>

446
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,250
<b>What?</b>

447
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:26,080
<b>What does she mean?</b>

448
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:43,531
<b>Come here.</b>

449
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:47,040
<b>He said he'd work with you.</b>

450
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,841
<b>- He must have changed his mind. - In a few hours?</b>

451
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:53,881
<b>I know how he used to be.</b>

452
00:33:54,711 --> 00:33:56,750
<b>He wasn't like that. It's the slump.</b>

453
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:59,211
<b>Does a slump mean you can be mean to people?</b>

454
00:33:59,821 --> 00:34:01,381
<b>Don't yield to his flippant behavior.</b>

455
00:34:01,381 --> 00:34:03,991
<b>- Come with me. - I'm fine.</b>

456
00:34:04,421 --> 00:34:07,591
<b>I mean it. Are you okay?</b>

457
00:34:07,591 --> 00:34:08,761
<b>Are you stupid?</b>

458
00:34:09,491 --> 00:34:10,861
<b>If you call this "yielding",</b>

459
00:34:10,861 --> 00:34:12,731
<b>you can't do anything.</b>

460
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:16,571
<b>Misunderstandings and mistakes happen.</b>

461
00:34:18,171 --> 00:34:19,401
<b>I'm fine.</b>

462
00:34:35,881 --> 00:34:39,361
<b>I feel wronged. So why am I not even angry?</b>

463
00:34:46,031 --> 00:34:47,060
<b>Darn it.</b>

464
00:34:48,861 --> 00:34:50,671
<b>Don't be mad.</b>

465
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:54,640
<b>Soon Ho, don't lose your temper if you want to stay in Seoul.</b>

466
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,671
<b>Darn it.</b>

467
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:00,481
<b>- She ran away? - Yes.</b>

468
00:35:00,481 --> 00:35:03,580
<b>Seo Woo ran away, and... I'm so furious.</b>

469
00:35:04,151 --> 00:35:05,950
<b>The nice ones are always the first to leave.</b>

470
00:35:06,821 --> 00:35:08,281
<b>Where did she go?</b>

471
00:35:08,281 --> 00:35:10,921
<b>I don't know. She walked away calmly...</b>

472
00:35:11,491 --> 00:35:14,591
<b>I'm so annoyed. I'm livid right now.</b>

473
00:35:16,191 --> 00:35:18,591
<b>Seo Woo defended Kang In Wook so much.</b>

474
00:35:19,031 --> 00:35:20,830
<b>She explained that there were many musicians...</b>

475
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:23,330
<b>who are gifted even if they aren't famous, and...</b>

476
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:26,640
<b>I hate how Kang In Wook stabs people in the back.</b>

477
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,741
<b>That Kang whatever was wrong.</b>

478
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:34,680
<b>What infuriates me more is that I'm just taking it.</b>

479
00:35:35,841 --> 00:35:37,011
<b>Why are you just taking it?</b>

480
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,220
<b>Right?</b>

481
00:35:41,051 --> 00:35:43,250
<b>I can't stand that jerk.</b>

482
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,830
<b>Mr. Kang In Wook.</b>

483
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:58,671
<b>You clearly said you'd work with Seo Woo,</b>

484
00:35:58,671 --> 00:36:00,140
<b>and that you'd try.</b>

485
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,970
<b>I heard you clearly.</b>

486
00:36:02,741 --> 00:36:04,071
<b>Seo Woo...</b>

487
00:36:05,111 --> 00:36:06,680
<b>must have been offended.</b>

488
00:36:09,481 --> 00:36:10,981
<b>I had my reasons.</b>

489
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:14,651
<b>You repeatedly disrespect others.</b>

490
00:36:14,651 --> 00:36:15,651
<b>Let me explain.</b>

491
00:36:15,651 --> 00:36:16,790
<b>Explain to yourself.</b>

492
00:36:16,821 --> 00:36:19,821
<b>You're paying by the hour to rent this place,</b>

493
00:36:19,821 --> 00:36:22,890
<b>so explain to yourself or pound on the piano.</b>

494
00:36:41,981 --> 00:36:44,051
<b>I need some powerful healing.</b>

495
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:16,180
<b>What's wrong with him? He always leaves it open.</b>

496
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,941
<b>(New deadline)</b>

497
00:39:56,941 --> 00:39:58,241
<b>Are you going to Oslo?</b>

498
00:39:58,841 --> 00:40:00,111
<b>Should I?</b>

499
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,051
<b>You should've done everything you could to hide it.</b>

500
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:08,781
<b>It would've been nothing if I didn't know.</b>

501
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:12,151
<b>The more it killed you, the more you should've hidden it.</b>

502
00:40:12,151 --> 00:40:14,720
<b>- You should've done everything... - Why can't you understand me?</b>

503
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,461
<b>I didn't do it on purpose.</b>

504
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,631
<b>It was a mistake.</b>

505
00:40:24,131 --> 00:40:26,000
<b>Just say it's okay.</b>

506
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:29,671
<b>If you would, I'll be able to live.</b>

507
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:42,720
<b>Are you free?</b>

508
00:40:48,921 --> 00:40:50,160
<b>It won't take long.</b>

509
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:08,540
<b>Do you want to drink? Or eat?</b>

510
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:39,881
<b>Ms. Moon is with Mr. Kang.</b>

511
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:41,381
<b>Soon Ho's inside?</b>

512
00:41:42,841 --> 00:41:44,310
<b>Why are they together?</b>

513
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:45,881
<b>They're probably arguing.</b>

514
00:41:46,151 --> 00:41:48,450
<b>She called me, huffing and puffing.</b>

515
00:41:49,821 --> 00:41:52,591
<b>She can't stand it when people break their promise.</b>

516
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:55,290
<b>She is a bit sensitive.</b>

517
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,761
<b>She's beyond sensitive.</b>

518
00:41:59,461 --> 00:42:02,301
<b>That's why she shunned the world and lived on a farm...</b>

519
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:05,301
<b>for about nine years.</b>

520
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:14,781
<b>I mean...</b>

521
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,750
<b>You got dumped as soon as you came?</b>

522
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:21,720
<b>You hadn't seen her in years, so you came, and she dumped you?</b>

523
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:25,191
<b>Of all the...</b>

524
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:27,461
<b>I'm tearing up.</b>

525
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:30,691
<b>What's that girl Ji Soo's deal?</b>

526
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:34,461
<b>What a dramatic way to be stabbed in the back.</b>

527
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,970
<b>I never liked someone I just met this much before.</b>

528
00:42:41,370 --> 00:42:43,671
<b>How are we so alike?</b>

529
00:42:43,671 --> 00:42:45,370
<b>Birds of a feather.</b>

530
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,830
<b>She and her first love had promised to get married,</b>

531
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:13,700
<b>but he fell for Soon Ho's best friend.</b>

532
00:43:14,841 --> 00:43:17,540
<b>She took me to a restaurant to cheer me up,</b>

533
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:20,140
<b>and just bawled.</b>

534
00:43:20,781 --> 00:43:23,711
<b>That's when she left Seoul and went to a farm.</b>

535
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:25,250
<b>She became a gardener.</b>

536
00:43:25,981 --> 00:43:27,220
<b>Soon Ho...</b>

537
00:43:28,551 --> 00:43:30,520
<b>is very frail.</b>

538
00:43:34,461 --> 00:43:35,921
<b>Where can we go?</b>

539
00:43:36,361 --> 00:43:37,631
<b>Are you very hungry?</b>

540
00:43:43,531 --> 00:43:44,970
<b>I was worried.</b>

541
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:58,680
<b>Okay. I'll listen to your story now.</b>

542
00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:01,120
<b>If you have nothing to say, I'll start.</b>

543
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,321
<b>Keep coming as scheduled for this week.</b>

544
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:07,020
<b>As Seo Woo said, it may be a misunderstanding and a mistake.</b>

545
00:44:07,861 --> 00:44:12,261
<b>You can make a new reservation at a new studio with a new heart.</b>

546
00:44:13,301 --> 00:44:15,031
<b>You must care a lot about Seo Woo.</b>

547
00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:18,671
<b>- Are you close? - I'm not close to anyone.</b>

548
00:44:18,970 --> 00:44:20,770
<b>I don't really care for people.</b>

549
00:44:20,770 --> 00:44:23,410
<b>You come into this world alone, and you leave alone.</b>

550
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:25,171
<b>I want to be as lonely as possible.</b>

551
00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:27,111
<b>Then why are you so thoughtful of Seo Woo?</b>

552
00:44:27,111 --> 00:44:30,180
<b>Mr. Kang. When people look after someone else,</b>

553
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:33,881
<b>you can't look at it as them liking them or being close.</b>

554
00:44:34,151 --> 00:44:36,651
<b>This is purely about your promise.</b>

555
00:44:36,651 --> 00:44:38,651
<b>You broke your promise,</b>

556
00:44:38,651 --> 00:44:40,191
<b>Seo Woo was hurt,</b>

557
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:42,120
<b>and I was annoyed.</b>

558
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:50,071
<b>Did you first meet Seo Woo after you came to the studio?</b>

559
00:44:51,301 --> 00:44:52,770
<b>That's right.</b>

560
00:44:53,841 --> 00:44:57,140
<b>As soon as I came, she did a difficult favor for me.</b>

561
00:44:58,211 --> 00:45:01,481
<b>I was buying dishes online, but I didn't want to use my name.</b>

562
00:45:01,481 --> 00:45:03,111
<b>She did it for me.</b>

563
00:45:03,281 --> 00:45:05,611
<b>It may seem like nothing,</b>

564
00:45:05,611 --> 00:45:07,421
<b>but it could raise suspicions.</b>

565
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:09,350
<b>"Why doesn't she order them herself?"</b>

566
00:45:09,350 --> 00:45:10,890
<b>"Does she have bad credit?"</b>

567
00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:12,921
<b>I would've been suspicious.</b>

568
00:45:17,361 --> 00:45:19,060
<b>That's part of the reason for your slump too.</b>

569
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:21,100
<b>You suspect and doubt everyone.</b>

570
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:23,401
<b>Whom did you buy the dishes from?</b>

571
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:26,700
<b>Well...</b>

572
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:30,071
<b>It was online. How would I know?</b>

573
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:34,640
<b>True. All you need are the address and contact information.</b>

574
00:45:35,381 --> 00:45:37,111
<b>There's no need to meet.</b>

575
00:45:37,111 --> 00:45:38,611
<b>Obviously.</b>

576
00:45:43,651 --> 00:45:45,591
<b>I'll record with Seo Woo next time.</b>

577
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:48,091
<b>Are you kidding me?</b>

578
00:45:51,091 --> 00:45:52,361
<b>I'm not kidding.</b>

579
00:45:58,901 --> 00:46:00,040
<b>Are you using the dishes?</b>

580
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:01,970
<b>I'm not using them.</b>

581
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:04,410
<b>I was asked through someone else.</b>

582
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:14,180
<b>Life is so disgustingly entangled.</b>

583
00:46:17,950 --> 00:46:19,720
<b>Why do you keep laughing?</b>

584
00:46:22,091 --> 00:46:24,861
<b>I was just dumbfounded.</b>

585
00:46:29,531 --> 00:46:31,600
<b>We're out of sandwiches.</b>

586
00:46:36,341 --> 00:46:38,011
<b>How about instant noodles?</b>

587
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:40,140
<b>- Here? - Yes.</b>

588
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:43,140
<b>Instant noodles taste so good at a cafe.</b>

589
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:48,881
<b>(Closed, See you next time)</b>

590
00:47:00,261 --> 00:47:02,961
<b>Should I testify about how you waited?</b>

591
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:04,671
<b>I guess she isn't coming today either.</b>

592
00:47:05,571 --> 00:47:06,841
<b>She'll come eventually.</b>

593
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,700
<b>Once she does, I'll testify as to how much you waited.</b>

594
00:47:15,241 --> 00:47:16,241
<b>No.</b>

595
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:21,180
<b>I was waiting for someone else.</b>

596
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:25,250
<b>Someone I know too.</b>

597
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,491
<b>Did you see her since?</b>

598
00:47:33,961 --> 00:47:34,961
<b>No.</b>

599
00:47:35,430 --> 00:47:38,171
<b>Everyone who waits at our cafe met the other person eventually.</b>

600
00:47:38,531 --> 00:47:40,301
<b>Every cafe has a story.</b>

601
00:47:41,370 --> 00:47:44,171
<b>I feel bad when I see a customer who was stood up.</b>

602
00:47:45,111 --> 00:47:47,111
<b>Then the next day, they come together.</b>

603
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:49,040
<b>I'm sure you'll see her.</b>

604
00:47:58,091 --> 00:47:59,250
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

605
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:35,961
<b>I shouldn't have said anything.</b>

606
00:48:37,991 --> 00:48:39,060
<b>It's okay.</b>

607
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,531
<b>He should've cried long ago.</b>

608
00:48:49,841 --> 00:48:51,111
<b>You stood right there...</b>

609
00:48:52,071 --> 00:48:54,441
<b>with a woman before, right?</b>

610
00:48:58,511 --> 00:48:59,580
<b>That woman...</b>

611
00:49:01,051 --> 00:49:03,720
<b>came first and looked up at the ceiling by herself,</b>

612
00:49:05,051 --> 00:49:06,191
<b>so I remember.</b>

613
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:10,591
<b>That's her.</b>

614
00:49:14,261 --> 00:49:15,401
<b>The person he waited for.</b>

615
00:49:19,231 --> 00:49:20,470
<b>She came.</b>

616
00:49:46,961 --> 00:49:47,961
<b>Seo Woo.</b>

617
00:49:48,731 --> 00:49:51,901
<b>Would you please tell Won not to wait at the cafe?</b>

618
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:19,591
<b>Are you really the person who said he never ever cries?</b>

619
00:50:20,961 --> 00:50:23,600
<b>I guess I cry too. I only found out today.</b>

620
00:50:25,270 --> 00:50:28,401
<b>Plus, didn't you come because you were worried about me?</b>

621
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:32,910
<b>This isn't why I came.</b>

622
00:50:34,841 --> 00:50:36,180
<b>I'm so encouraged.</b>

623
00:50:36,881 --> 00:50:38,950
<b>Why was it cathartic for me when you're the one who cried?</b>

624
00:50:40,850 --> 00:50:43,220
<b>- Let's go. - Where?</b>

625
00:50:44,850 --> 00:50:45,850
<b>Taxi.</b>

626
00:50:52,430 --> 00:50:54,231
<b>I guess you feel awkward.</b>

627
00:50:55,231 --> 00:50:56,861
<b>Why are you waving at an empty street?</b>

628
00:51:06,571 --> 00:51:08,810
<b>It's nice to see you, Ha Won.</b>

629
00:51:12,051 --> 00:51:13,611
<b>Can I be Ha Won now?</b>

630
00:51:19,890 --> 00:51:21,620
<b>Don't you have anything to say to Before Dawn?</b>

631
00:51:22,691 --> 00:51:24,361
<b>I don't think he'll be back.</b>

632
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:30,970
<b>So this is my last time with Before Dawn.</b>

633
00:51:34,301 --> 00:51:36,341
<b>I can't tell him not to leave.</b>

634
00:51:43,211 --> 00:51:44,580
<b>Will you turn around?</b>

635
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:46,481
<b>Just say it.</b>

636
00:51:47,850 --> 00:51:49,180
<b>Because you're Before Dawn?</b>

637
00:52:03,801 --> 00:52:06,731
<b>Before Dawn. Goodbye.</b>

638
00:52:09,571 --> 00:52:10,741
<b>Thank you for everything.</b>

639
00:52:15,941 --> 00:52:17,011
<b>I'm done.</b>

640
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:25,250
<b>Taxi.</b>

641
00:52:36,929 --> 00:52:41,929
<b>Kim Ji Soo. Let me hear you scream.</b>

642
00:52:42,529 --> 00:52:45,768
<b>DJ, play something upbeat.</b>

643
00:52:48,699 --> 00:52:51,009
<b>Where's the music?</b>

644
00:52:53,009 --> 00:52:54,009
<b>Kim Ji Soo.</b>

645
00:52:56,509 --> 00:52:57,548
<b>Did he change it?</b>

646
00:52:58,809 --> 00:53:01,318
<b>You think I can't find you if you hide, right?</b>

647
00:53:02,119 --> 00:53:03,119
<b>Genie.</b>

648
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:04,989
<b>Siri.</b>

649
00:53:17,498 --> 00:53:20,498
<b>- The device? - No. Listen to it.</b>

650
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:36,748
<b>This was...</b>

651
00:53:38,719 --> 00:53:40,389
<b>from when I first met you.</b>

652
00:53:59,009 --> 00:54:00,239
<b>I remember.</b>

653
00:54:00,579 --> 00:54:04,048
<b>I was looking down, but some guy was looking around,</b>

654
00:54:04,048 --> 00:54:06,009
<b>so I raised the volume so he could hear it better.</b>

655
00:54:06,009 --> 00:54:08,248
<b>Oh my gosh. Was that you?</b>

656
00:54:10,489 --> 00:54:12,789
<b>So you remember when you first saw me.</b>

657
00:54:13,518 --> 00:54:14,559
<b>Clear as day.</b>

658
00:54:15,259 --> 00:54:17,228
<b>I heard the song, so I looked up,</b>

659
00:54:17,228 --> 00:54:19,588
<b>went to the studio, and you were there.</b>

660
00:54:20,498 --> 00:54:21,728
<b>I told you...</b>

661
00:54:21,728 --> 00:54:24,369
<b>a relationship will last long if you remember when you first met.</b>

662
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:28,268
<b>I must have made a huge impression. Right?</b>

663
00:54:29,298 --> 00:54:30,338
<b>Of course.</b>

664
00:54:32,768 --> 00:54:34,809
<b>The first meeting that I remember...</b>

665
00:54:34,809 --> 00:54:37,378
<b>was when you were in the studio.</b>

666
00:54:38,208 --> 00:54:39,208
<b>It's different.</b>

667
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:42,219
<b>What happens if we remember different moments?</b>

668
00:54:43,279 --> 00:54:45,588
<b>Wait and see what happens.</b>

669
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:49,789
<b>Do you feel better?</b>

670
00:54:51,029 --> 00:54:52,989
<b>I said that to cheer you up.</b>

671
00:54:54,529 --> 00:54:58,168
<b>I forgot that I was upset once I saw you cry.</b>

672
00:55:14,018 --> 00:55:15,818
<b>I think the door's open.</b>

673
00:55:16,119 --> 00:55:17,818
<b>Stop.</b>

674
00:55:18,018 --> 00:55:19,449
<b>We're not done talking.</b>

675
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:23,789
<b>This is dangerous.</b>

676
00:55:23,789 --> 00:55:25,228
<b>Hold on.</b>

677
00:55:43,878 --> 00:55:46,809
<b>It's nicer than it looks from the outside. And it's warm.</b>

678
00:55:46,809 --> 00:55:48,748
<b>I live here because it's not bad.</b>

679
00:55:48,748 --> 00:55:50,849
<b>Eun Joo wouldn't let me stay just anywhere.</b>

680
00:56:17,079 --> 00:56:18,548
<b>What about the device?</b>

681
00:56:18,548 --> 00:56:19,679
<b>I got rid of it.</b>

682
00:56:22,179 --> 00:56:24,219
<b>Saying, "I got rid of it," sounds so...</b>

683
00:56:28,389 --> 00:56:29,759
<b>Before,</b>

684
00:56:30,489 --> 00:56:32,829
<b>it was clear what Ji Soo was giving me.</b>

685
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:38,228
<b>If I was having a hard time, I was happy if I thought about her.</b>

686
00:56:40,298 --> 00:56:42,898
<b>If I felt empty inside, I'd think about her...</b>

687
00:56:43,639 --> 00:56:45,469
<b>and I was able to console myself.</b>

688
00:56:47,938 --> 00:56:50,239
<b>Ji Soo kept me in place.</b>

689
00:56:54,748 --> 00:56:56,779
<b>But now, if I think about her,</b>

690
00:56:58,918 --> 00:57:00,119
<b>it's too hard.</b>

691
00:57:07,858 --> 00:57:09,798
<b>You're right. It's time to stop.</b>

692
00:57:11,429 --> 00:57:13,938
<b>But saying you'll stop something is so vague.</b>

693
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:16,798
<b>But everything has a way...</b>

694
00:57:17,608 --> 00:57:19,768
<b>when you look inside.</b>

695
00:57:24,449 --> 00:57:26,048
<b>I'm determined,</b>

696
00:57:28,018 --> 00:57:30,279
<b>so I'll figure out what and how...</b>

697
00:57:30,918 --> 00:57:32,248
<b>to stop.</b>

698
00:57:34,958 --> 00:57:36,289
<b>That's me.</b>

699
00:57:38,188 --> 00:57:39,559
<b>Your turn.</b>

700
00:57:40,728 --> 00:57:42,398
<b>You said...</b>

701
00:57:43,659 --> 00:57:45,029
<b>you liked looking at me.</b>

702
00:57:49,298 --> 00:57:51,568
<b>To be honest, I didn't know what that meant.</b>

703
00:57:53,139 --> 00:57:56,539
<b>For many years, I put no value in physically seeing someone,</b>

704
00:57:57,248 --> 00:58:00,478
<b>and I believed feelings continued even if you didn't see each other.</b>

705
00:58:02,279 --> 00:58:03,878
<b>But I get it now.</b>

706
00:58:05,688 --> 00:58:07,688
<b>I get what it means to like looking at someone.</b>

707
00:58:14,958 --> 00:58:16,898
<b>It was nice looking at it...</b>

708
00:58:18,429 --> 00:58:19,898
<b>when things were tough.</b>

709
00:58:22,398 --> 00:58:23,798
<b>What do you mean?</b>

710
00:58:42,818 --> 00:58:43,958
<b>And...</b>

711
00:58:47,329 --> 00:58:48,699
<b>You didn't quit, right?</b>

712
00:58:50,498 --> 00:58:52,929
<b>Again. There's no subject.</b>

713
00:58:52,929 --> 00:58:54,938
<b>One percent is a lot. You shouldn't quit.</b>

714
00:58:54,938 --> 00:58:56,398
<b>One percent it everything.</b>

715
00:58:59,809 --> 00:59:02,338
<b>I really want to see how your one percent...</b>

716
00:59:03,679 --> 00:59:05,009
<b>grows.</b>

717
00:59:12,818 --> 00:59:13,949
<b>Seo Woo.</b>

718
00:59:15,318 --> 00:59:17,358
<b>- Seo Woo. - Give me a minute.</b>

719
00:59:19,429 --> 00:59:20,699
<b>Seo Woo.</b>

720
00:59:23,429 --> 00:59:26,128
<b>Jin Soo has been lost at the station for half an hour.</b>

721
00:59:26,128 --> 00:59:28,498
<b>I'm going to pick him up, so you should go up.</b>

722
00:59:28,498 --> 00:59:30,438
<b>Why are you down here? You know we're busy.</b>

723
00:59:30,438 --> 00:59:32,838
<b>Eun Joo's doing everything. Hurry.</b>

724
00:59:32,838 --> 00:59:34,208
<b>That's right.</b>

725
00:59:47,219 --> 00:59:50,518
<b>We always have a big dinner when we get a new tenant.</b>

726
00:59:50,518 --> 00:59:51,989
<b>I forgot.</b>

727
00:59:52,029 --> 00:59:54,529
<b>Eun Joo will kill me if I skip it.</b>

728
01:00:06,338 --> 01:00:07,708
<b>One more thing.</b>

729
01:00:09,208 --> 01:00:13,048
<b>I think it'll be best to find out everything while you're determined.</b>

730
01:00:15,648 --> 01:00:18,949
<b>There is one more thing Ji Soo wanted...</b>

731
01:00:20,548 --> 01:00:22,318
<b>to tell you.</b>

732
01:00:30,429 --> 01:00:34,699
<b>She went to the spot where you were supposed to meet.</b>

733
01:00:42,809 --> 01:00:44,208
<b>Seo Woo.</b>

734
01:00:44,208 --> 01:00:47,208
<b>Add some soy sauce to the japchae. It's bland.</b>

735
01:00:47,748 --> 01:00:48,878
<b>Okay.</b>

736
01:00:56,018 --> 01:00:58,429
<b>The alleys are a bit confusing,</b>

737
01:00:58,429 --> 01:01:02,029
<b>but there's a butcher on the street leading to our house.</b>

738
01:01:02,029 --> 01:01:03,398
<b>- A butcher? - Yes.</b>

739
01:01:03,398 --> 01:01:06,099
<b>The chicken next door to them is really good.</b>

740
01:01:06,199 --> 01:01:07,838
<b>Butcher. Chicken.</b>

741
01:02:05,929 --> 01:02:07,699
<b>If only I had turned around...</b>

742
01:02:20,039 --> 01:02:21,139
<b>Ji Soo.</b>

743
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:24,849
<b>Quitting you...</b>

744
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:36,989
<b>is putting an end...</b>

745
01:02:37,759 --> 01:02:39,559
<b>to my endless regret.</b>

746
01:02:49,969 --> 01:02:51,739
<b>Here.</b>

747
01:02:52,438 --> 01:02:53,838
<b>Welcome.</b>

748
01:02:55,139 --> 01:02:57,849
<b>Take how much you want to eat.</b>

749
01:02:57,949 --> 01:03:00,409
<b>All I've had was a roll of gimbap.</b>

750
01:03:00,409 --> 01:03:01,748
<b>Thank you.</b>

751
01:03:01,748 --> 01:03:03,018
<b>- Eat up. - Her japchae...</b>

752
01:03:03,018 --> 01:03:04,418
<b>is the best.</b>

753
01:03:05,849 --> 01:03:08,619
<b>Soo Ji used to love japchae.</b>

754
01:03:08,619 --> 01:03:09,958
<b>Who's Soo Ji?</b>

755
01:03:09,958 --> 01:03:11,958
<b>- Well... - No one important.</b>

756
01:03:12,059 --> 01:03:14,188
<b>Why are you bringing her up?</b>

757
01:03:15,029 --> 01:03:16,498
<b>Are you two close?</b>

758
01:03:16,498 --> 01:03:17,869
<b>The thing is...</b>

759
01:03:17,869 --> 01:03:20,938
<b>Well... We're dating. Yes.</b>

760
01:03:20,938 --> 01:03:23,068
<b>- Don't mind us. - Okay.</b>

761
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:31,648
<b>- It's delicious. - Thanks.</b>

762
01:03:32,708 --> 01:03:36,478
<b>I need to make a call. I left my phone downstairs.</b>

763
01:03:37,688 --> 01:03:39,018
<b>Hurry back.</b>

764
01:04:04,679 --> 01:04:06,608
<b>I never quit.</b>

765
01:04:08,548 --> 01:04:11,248
<b>But it's not like I want or expect anything...</b>

766
01:04:11,518 --> 01:04:13,619
<b>from you, so...</b>

767
01:04:15,219 --> 01:04:18,989
<b>I'll take care of myself, so... Ha Won,</b>

768
01:04:20,789 --> 01:04:22,699
<b>make sure to find out.</b>

769
01:04:23,228 --> 01:04:24,398
<b>You can do it.</b>

770
01:04:24,398 --> 01:04:25,768
<b>I found out...</b>

771
01:04:26,829 --> 01:04:29,639
<b>what and how to stop.</b>

772
01:04:31,139 --> 01:04:32,938
<b>I did find out, but...</b>

773
01:04:35,539 --> 01:04:37,539
<b>I need you to do something for me.</b>

774
01:04:42,818 --> 01:04:44,688
<b>You just...</b>

775
01:04:45,949 --> 01:04:49,219
<b>have to go back and forth...</b>

776
01:04:49,418 --> 01:04:50,958
<b>so I can see you.</b>

777
01:04:52,358 --> 01:04:54,659
<b>The thing you said you liked looking at...</b>

778
01:04:55,958 --> 01:04:57,029
<b>You don't mean...</b>

779
01:05:01,768 --> 01:05:05,039
<b>I can't say exactly what this feeling is.</b>

780
01:05:05,938 --> 01:05:06,969
<b>But...</b>

781
01:05:13,648 --> 01:05:15,079
<b>I need you.</b>

782
01:05:17,688 --> 01:05:20,748
<b>Can you stay?</b>

783
01:05:55,259 --> 01:05:56,358
<b>Please stay.</b>

784
01:06:29,919 --> 01:06:32,459
<b>(A Piece of Your Mind)</b>

785
01:06:32,459 --> 01:06:34,388
<b>I want to play it for you.</b>

786
01:06:34,388 --> 01:06:35,858
<b>I'll have to show you what I can do.</b>

787
01:06:36,299 --> 01:06:37,829
<b>You'll be floored.</b>

788
01:06:38,169 --> 01:06:39,329
<b>I always get...</b>

789
01:06:39,329 --> 01:06:41,699
<b>so nervous this time of year.</b>

790
01:06:41,699 --> 01:06:43,638
<b>You're hiding something, aren't you?</b>

791
01:06:43,638 --> 01:06:45,409
<b>I feel like I'm being exposed.</b>

792
01:06:45,608 --> 01:06:48,409
<b>- I left something behind. - What, your heart?</b>

793
01:06:48,739 --> 01:06:49,779
<b>My bike.</b>

794
01:06:49,779 --> 01:06:52,049
<b>It's pretty! It's totally my style.</b>

795
01:06:52,879 --> 01:06:54,348
<b>The worst already happened.</b>

796
01:06:54,619 --> 01:06:56,348
<b>At least one person should live.</b>

797
01:06:56,518 --> 01:06:58,518
<b>One percent. And one person.</b>

798
01:06:58,718 --> 01:07:01,018
<b>The one asking you to stay should follow you around.</b>
