taking them so long to chat?</b>

2
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:28,726
<b>Is everything going well?</b>

3
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,630
<b>What did he say?
Is he okay with extending this?</b>

4
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,879
<b>Yes, he is.</b>

5
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:35,390
<b>He'll let me go on with this
as much as I want.</b>

6
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:38,189
<b>But he's acting
a little weird today.</b>

7
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,789
<b>He's weird? How so?</b>

8
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:42,929
<b>Isn't it a good thing
that he agreed?</b>

9
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:45,700
<b>He's treating me way too nicely,
and it feels like something is up.</b>

10
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:48,700
<b>I think he wanted to see me...</b>

11
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:50,369
<b>to ask me out.</b>

12
00:00:54,469 --> 00:00:56,009
<b>Ask you out? That's nonsense.</b>

17
00:01:06,679 --> 00:01:09,020
<b>Is she reading

18

24
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:34,980

35
00:02:57,259 --> 00:03:00,659
<b>Man, I should have splashed water

<b>What are you talking about?</b>

37
00:03:02,169 --> 00:03:03,746
<b>I should have told him off...</b>

38

<b>that he shouldn't do that
and that he'll regret this.</b>

<b>What are you saying?</b>

40
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,485
<b>I couldn't do anything. I couldn't.</b>

41
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:10,909
<b>I should have done something.</b>

42
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:12,539
<b>You got turned down again.</b>

43
00:03:12,939 --> 00:03:14,186
<b>You thought he was
going to ask you out,</b>

44
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:15,780
<b>but you overreacted
and got turned down.</b>

45
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,150
<b>There was no time for me to do that.</b>

46
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,520
<b>I'm the best at splashing people,
slapping them, and cursing them.</b>

47
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,726
<b>I've done it
dozens of times in dramas,</b>

48
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,865
<b>but I couldn't do anything
when it happened in real life.</b>

49
00:03:26,889 --> 00:03:28,590
<b>What happened?</b>

50
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:31,135
<b>I thought he said he'd let you
do everything as you wish.</b>

51
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:32,659
<b>You said he was way too nice.</b>

52
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,930
<b>That's why I spaced out
without doing anything.</b>

53
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,639
<b>You're a good person.</b>

54
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,009
<b>I want you to always be happy.</b>

55
00:03:44,469 --> 00:03:47,340
<b>He said something like that
with the kindest face.</b>

56
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:51,750
<b>That doesn't matter.
It's all fake anyway.</b>

57
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:55,695
<b>Then he suddenly became cold
and treated me coldly.</b>

58
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:57,795
<b>He was way too different.</b>

59
00:03:57,819 --> 00:04:00,436
<b>He hugs me, then slaps me.
Then he hugs me again and slaps me.</b>

60
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,060
<b>What? He slapped you?</b>

61
00:04:02,229 --> 00:04:03,865
<b>- That jerk...
- No.</b>

62
00:04:03,889 --> 00:04:05,876
<b>It's not that
I was actually slapped.</b>

63
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,876
<b>That's just how I felt. My feelings.</b>

64
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,069
<b>So? In conclusion,
you were turned down again.</b>

65
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:13,439
<b>Yes.</b>

66
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,909
<b>Figures.</b>

67
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:18,015
<b>It would've been overreacting...</b>

68
00:04:18,039 --> 00:04:19,879
<b>for me to splash him or curse him.</b>

69
00:04:20,979 --> 00:04:23,379
<b>I couldn't do anything else

70

It's not like you to get depressed.</b>

<b>so that everyone here can hear you?</b>

305
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,285
<b>Are you guys still pretending
to like each other? It's not real?</b>

306
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:40,515
<b>Of course, not.</b>

307
00:17:40,539 --> 00:17:42,640
<b>You should do better.</b>

308
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,380
<b>You know
you don't deserve her, right?</b>

309
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:48,079
<b>Why are you singing
a different tune now?</b>

310
00:17:48,579 --> 00:17:51,250
<b>Didn't you say that
she didn't have a good reputation?</b>

311
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:52,926
<b>Didn't you say
I'd be at a disadvantage...</b>

312
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:54,035
<b>if I were to date her?</b>

313
00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:56,835
<b>That was in the past.
Things have changed now.</b>

314
00:17:56,859 --> 00:17:58,265
<b>How could you call yourself
a reporter...</b>

315
00:17:58,289 --> 00:17:59,876
<b>when you're so dull
about your surroundings?</b>

316
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,176
<b>We don't need to promote the movie.</b>

317
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:06,005
<b>It's number one in the box office.</b>

318
00:18:06,029 --> 00:18:08,376
<b>Thanks to that movie,
everyone likes her now.</b>

319
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,745
<b>She became the symbol of first love.</b>

320
00:18:09,769 --> 00:18:11,269
<b>The symbol of first love?</b>

321
00:18:12,609 --> 00:18:14,186
<b>- No way.
- I watched the movie last week.</b>

322
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:15,616
<b>- No way.
- I watched the movie last week.</b>

323
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,650
<b>Hey, the movie was pretty good.</b>

324
00:18:18,049 --> 00:18:19,426
<b>It's entertaining.</b>

325
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:21,025
<b>And it's artistic.</b>

326
00:18:21,049 --> 00:18:23,626
<b>And Ha Jin's acting in the movie
was pretty good.</b>

327
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:25,896
<b>Halfway through the movie,
she cries...</b>

328
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,436
<b>and delivers a monologue.</b>

329
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,495
<b>I read it in an interview...</b>

330
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:32,160
<b>that she came up with the monologue
herself at the shoot.</b>

331
00:18:32,589 --> 00:18:34,900
<b>I'm sure you watched it.
What did you think?</b>

332
00:18:35,299 --> 00:18:37,130
<b>- I didn't watch it yet.
- Hey!</b>

333
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:39,170
<b>She startled me.</b>

334
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,000
<b>Enjoy your meal.</b>

335
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,686
<b>You still haven't watched it?</b>

336
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:44,985
<b>You'd better watch it soon.</b>

337
00:18:45,009 --> 00:18:46,456
<b>You have to watch the movie...</b>

338
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,380
<b>if you're going to interview
the director.</b>

339
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,456
<b>Hey. Anyway,</b>

340
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,420
<b>the interview with the director
is a done deal.</b>

341
00:18:55,779 --> 00:18:58,825
<b>And bring Ha Jin up in a subtle
manner during the interview.</b>

342
00:18:58,849 --> 00:18:59,995
<b>You know what I mean, right?</b>

343
00:19:00,019 --> 00:19:03,759
<b>People go like this and cringe,
but they enjoy hearing about them.</b>

344
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:06,376
<b>Seriously.</b>

345
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,230
<b>What happened to the righteous
reporter, full of conviction?</b>

346
00:19:09,329 --> 00:19:12,005
<b>You became a materialistic director
who only cares about the ratings.</b>

347
00:19:12,029 --> 00:19:13,345
<b>Hey, put yourself in my shoes.</b>

348
00:19:13,369 --> 00:19:15,240
<b>You can't just ignore
the TV ratings.</b>

349
00:19:16,869 --> 00:19:19,345
<b>Look at the time. Hey,
this materialistic director...</b>

350
00:19:19,369 --> 00:19:21,555
<b>is leaving because she has
a meeting with the higher-ups.</b>

351
00:19:21,579 --> 00:19:23,150
<b>Finish your meal.</b>

352
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:44,706
<b>It's a promotion for the movie.</b>

353
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:46,515
<b>Why does she want to cook
and pack meal boxes?</b>

354
00:19:46,539 --> 00:19:48,476
<b>Other actors and actresses
will just hold a signing event.</b>

355
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,839
<b>So this is what
you want to make, right?</b>

356
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:54,279
<b>(Ingredients: Eggs, cheeses...)</b>

357
00:20:02,779 --> 00:20:04,765
<b>But I thought
she wasn't a good cook.</b>

358
00:20:04,789 --> 00:20:07,235
<b>That's an overstatement.
She's an awful cook.</b>

359
00:20:07,259 --> 00:20:09,390
<b>When she cooks,
even ramyeon doesn't taste good.</b>

360
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:11,966
<b>Then, how is she going to make this?</b>

361
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:13,630
<b>And she'll make 100 meal boxes.</b>

362
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:15,906
<b>- I did it.
- Are you already done?</b>

363
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:18,406
<b>No, I separated the yolk.</b>

364
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:20,900
<b>- Look at this.
- Just one?</b>

365
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,700
<b>I can't watch this.</b>

366
00:20:23,269 --> 00:20:25,240
<b>I'll take care of the eggs.
You do something else.</b>

367
00:20:25,869 --> 00:20:28,156
<b>But I promised to make them.
Is that okay?</b>

368
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,626
<b>You can make the rolled omelets
and decorate them.</b>

369
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:32,180
<b>We don't have much time left.</b>

370
00:20:39,349 --> 00:20:40,960
<b>You're really good.</b>

371
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:42,535
<b>Let me try it. Go away.</b>

372
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,966
<b>No, why don't you drizzle
the cooking oil on the pan?</b>

373
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:46,436
<b>You know you have
to preheat it, right?</b>

374
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:48,835
<b>Don't drizzle too much.
And be careful with the fire. Okay?</b>

375
00:20:48,859 --> 00:20:51,045
<b>Be careful with the knife.
And don't get hurt.</b>

376
00:20:51,069 --> 00:20:52,230
<b>Go away.</b>

377
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:22,430
<b>I did it.</b>

378
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,446
<b>Already? You made 100 of them?</b>

379
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:27,440
<b>No, just one.</b>

380
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,569
<b>What? Okay. Just one?</b>

381
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:34,079
<b>Don't open it. Or the decoration
will get messy.</b>

382
00:21:36,339 --> 00:21:37,686
<b>Oh, no.</b>

383
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:40,295
<b>- We're late. You must change now.
- What?</b>

384
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:41,726
<b>What about the rest?</b>

385
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,126
<b>I want to do more than giving
them autographs.</b>

386
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:44,565
<b>You should do what you're good at.</b>

387
00:21:44,589 --> 00:21:45,825
<b>Give them autographs
and take photos with them.</b>

388
00:21:45,849 --> 00:21:47,995
<b>Your fans would prefer that
over a bad meal box.</b>

389
00:21:48,019 --> 00:21:50,466
<b>That's right. If you prepare a lot,</b>

390
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:51,835
<b>there's a lot of pressure
on the next person.</b>

391
00:21:51,859 --> 00:21:53,376
<b>- Let's wash up.
- Is that so?</b>

392
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,706
<b>Let's give that one to the fan
who watched my movie the most.</b>

393
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:58,099
<b>- Sure. Do whatever you want.
- She's so pretty!</b>

394
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,706
<b>- She's so beautiful!
- Ha Jin is so pretty.</b>

395
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:01,400
<b>She took a photo with me.</b>

396
00:22:01,539 --> 00:22:04,315
<b>- Come here.
- She's such a beauty.</b>

397
00:22:04,339 --> 00:22:06,509
<b>- I can't believe this.
- She's so pretty.</b>

398
00:22:09,509 --> 00:22:12,180
<b>My goodness.
It was a long wait, wasn't it?</b>

399
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:15,255
<b>Here you go. Thank you, little one.</b>

400
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:17,295
<b>- Thank you for coming.
- Thank you.</b>

401
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:19,089
<b>You're so pretty!</b>

402
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:21,735
<b>You're prettier than Elsa.</b>

403
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:22,966
<b>Thank you.</b>

404
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:24,460
<b>Let's go, Joo Hee.</b>

405
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:26,930
<b>No! I don't want to go.</b>

406
00:22:27,859 --> 00:22:30,529
<b>Listen to Mommy. People
are waiting in line to see her.</b>

407
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:33,740
<b>I'm not leaving!
I'm going to stay here.</b>

408
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,740
<b>My goodness. What should I do?</b>

409
00:22:38,509 --> 00:22:41,240
<b>Oh, right. Do you want a present?</b>

410
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:43,240
<b>There's only one of this
in this world.</b>

411
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,509
<b>But in return, you have to
listen to your mom. Okay?</b>

412
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,750
<b>Ha Kyung, where's the meal box?</b>

413
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:51,519
<b>Where is it?</b>

414
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:53,250
<b>- She's so pretty.
- I can't wait.</b>

415
00:22:54,589 --> 00:22:55,660
<b>You'll give this to her?</b>

416
00:22:55,859 --> 00:22:57,029
<b>Think carefully about this.</b>

417
00:22:57,089 --> 00:22:58,289
<b>Okay.</b>

418
00:23:03,829 --> 00:23:05,130
<b>All right.</b>

419
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:08,416
<b>Ta-da. Open it.</b>

420
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,676
<b>Thank you, Ha Jin.</b>

421
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,386
<b>Let's open up the present
she gave you.</b>

422
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:13,410
<b>All right. 1, 2, 3.</b>

423
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:15,410
<b>Isn't it cute?</b>

424
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:20,750
<b>Mom, why is Pengsoo bleeding?</b>

425
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,589
<b>You're right. Pengsoo is bleeding.</b>

426
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:26,666
<b>The box must have shaken
on our way here. I'm sorry.</b>

427
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:29,866
<b>Okay. It's all right.
Let's go, Joo Hee.</b>

428
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:31,505
<b>All right. Take this.</b>

429
00:23:31,529 --> 00:23:32,660
<b>Bye.</b>

430
00:23:33,029 --> 00:23:34,430
<b>Bye.</b>

431
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,230
<b>Next. You can come now.</b>

432
00:23:36,329 --> 00:23:37,676
<b>I made this myself.</b>

433
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,829
<b>My gosh, thank you.</b>

434
00:23:40,069 --> 00:23:41,200
<b>Goodness.</b>

435
00:23:41,269 --> 00:23:43,075
<b>- Thank you for coming.
- Thank you.</b>

436
00:23:43,099 --> 00:23:44,440
<b>Go home safe.</b>

437
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:47,009
<b>- Hello.
- Jeong Hoon.</b>

438
00:23:47,579 --> 00:23:48,839
<b>Isn't that Ha Jin?</b>

439
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:53,819
<b>The couple of the century
is right here.</b>

440
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:57,049
<b>She's doing it here because of
the variety show she's on.</b>

441
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,795
<b>Why don't you go and say hello?</b>

442
00:23:59,819 --> 00:24:01,436
<b>She's only a few steps away
from our station.</b>

443
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:03,295
<b>It'd be disappointing to leave
without saying hello.</b>

444
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:04,529
<b>Stop it.</b>

445
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:10,500
<b>My gosh. She's greeting
everyone with a smile.</b>

446
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:12,646
<b>She's such a professional.</b>

447
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:14,339
<b>Your girlfriend is amazing.</b>

448
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:15,900
<b>Let's just go.</b>

449
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:21,616
<b>- Ha Jin, give me an autograph!
- You're so pretty!</b>

450
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,126
<b>- We love you!
- Bye!</b>

451
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:26,549
<b>- You're so pretty!
- Thank you.</b>

452
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:29,150
<b>Should I give Jeong Hoon a call?</b>

453
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:31,849
<b>Ha Jin, you're full of energy.
Aren't you even tired?</b>

454
00:24:32,019 --> 00:24:33,619
<b>His office is
right around the corner.</b>

455
00:24:33,819 --> 00:24:35,196
<b>Chul, how long do we have
until the next one?</b>

456
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,535
<b>We must go now.</b>

457
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:37,636
<b>Do we even have time to eat?</b>

458
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,366
<b>- There's no time to even breathe.
- Let's go now.</b>

459
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:42,059
<b>But still. Give me my phone.</b>

460
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,825
<b>Mom! Dad! A guy asked me out!</b>

461
00:25:05,849 --> 00:25:07,765
<b>He asked me out!</b>

462
00:25:07,789 --> 00:25:10,035
<b>My gosh, he's handsome.</b>

463
00:25:10,059 --> 00:25:11,259
<b>- My gosh.
- What do you think?</b>

464
00:25:11,589 --> 00:25:14,075
<b>- He looks nice.
- Come on. No, he doesn't.</b>

465
00:25:14,099 --> 00:25:16,230
<b>- I'm way too pretty for him.
- You brat.</b>

466
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,505
<b>- Hey, Tae Eun.
- Hey.</b>

467
00:25:19,529 --> 00:25:21,545
<b>- Sit down. Let's eat.
- Okay.</b>

468
00:25:21,569 --> 00:25:23,845
<b>I barely get to see you these days.</b>

469
00:25:23,869 --> 00:25:25,515
<b>- Are you dating a girl too?
- No.</b>

470
00:25:25,539 --> 00:25:27,055
<b>Why are you suddenly asking me that?</b>

471
00:25:27,079 --> 00:25:29,755
<b>Jeong Hoon is dating a girl.</b>

472
00:25:29,779 --> 00:25:31,480
<b>And everyone knows it.</b>

473
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:32,985
<b>Had I known he was available,</b>

474
00:25:33,009 --> 00:25:35,420
<b>I should have told him
about my feelings.</b>

475
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:39,119
<b>I had a crush on him
ever since I was little.</b>

476
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:42,696
<b>Really? You should have told me.</b>

477
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,106
<b>I didn't know. You hid it well.</b>

478
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:47,075
<b>Stop talking nonsense.</b>

479
00:25:47,099 --> 00:25:49,976
<b>- You can't date him.
- Why not?</b>

480
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,606
<b>He's a good guy, isn't he?</b>

481
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:54,416
<b>When I tell you that you can't,
you just can't.</b>

482
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:57,039
<b>Is it because of his condition?</b>

483
00:25:57,769 --> 00:26:00,585
<b>But he's all right now.</b>

484
00:26:00,609 --> 00:26:01,609
<b>"All right"?</b>

485
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:03,825
<b>He may seem all right
on the outside,</b>

486
00:26:03,849 --> 00:26:05,650
<b>but he's still a patient.</b>

487
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:07,349
<b>He's not normal.</b>

488
00:26:07,819 --> 00:26:11,089
<b>He's living with a time bomb
that could go off any minute.</b>

489
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:14,789
<b>But he got a lot better
thanks to you.</b>

490
00:26:15,059 --> 00:26:18,335
<b>He's strong.
I'm sure he can handle it.</b>

491
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:19,835
<b>Don't worry too much.</b>

492
00:26:19,859 --> 00:26:21,706
<b>You call yourself a doctor.</b>

493
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:23,775
<b>But how could you say
something irresponsible like that?</b>

494
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:25,545
<b>He's your patient.</b>

495
00:26:25,569 --> 00:26:27,569
<b>He's not your friend.</b>

496
00:26:27,869 --> 00:26:30,000
<b>Can't you do your job right?</b>

497
00:26:30,509 --> 00:26:32,045
<b>If you won't treat him,
just be his friend.</b>

498
00:26:32,069 --> 00:26:34,180
<b>Don't be his doctor.</b>

499
00:26:34,539 --> 00:26:37,956
<b>My goodness.
The food is getting cold.</b>

500
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:40,196
<b>I take it back.
I take back what I said.</b>

501
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,726
<b>How is it? Is it seasoned well?</b>

502
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,150
<b>- It's nice.
- Okay.</b>

503
00:26:43,849 --> 00:26:45,849
<b>- It's perfectly seasoned.
- Yes.</b>

504
00:26:58,099 --> 00:26:59,299
<b>We're here.</b>

505
00:27:00,599 --> 00:27:02,200
<b>Wake up. We're home.</b>

506
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,815
<b>Okay. Which show is this?</b>

507
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:06,386
<b>No shows. We're at home.</b>

508
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:08,079
<b>Let's go in and sleep on our beds.</b>

509
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,140
<b>Okay.</b>

510
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:11,450
<b>- My gosh.
- Hurry.</b>

511
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:19,190
<b>Close the door for me.</b>

512
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,819
<b>Hey, where are you?
Why aren't you home?</b>

513
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:24,660
<b>What do you mean?</b>

514
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:27,636
<b>Are you at my place again?</b>

515
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,275
<b>Of course.</b>

516
00:27:29,299 --> 00:27:31,345
<b>The fried chicken is getting cold.
Come home quickly.</b>

517
00:27:31,369 --> 00:27:32,900
<b>Do I run a fried chicken joint
at home?</b>

518
00:27:33,069 --> 00:27:35,569
<b>Why are you always eating
fried chicken at my house?</b>

519
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:38,069
<b>I can't go home right away.</b>

520
00:27:38,269 --> 00:27:39,509
<b>I'm at a movie theater.</b>

521
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:42,480
<b>A movie? Which movie
are you going to watch?</b>

522
00:27:42,809 --> 00:27:44,150
<b>"My First Love".</b>

523
00:27:44,549 --> 00:27:46,555
<b>Next week's guest is
Ji Hyun Geun, the director.</b>

524
00:27:46,579 --> 00:27:49,396
<b>So did you go to the movies
by yourself?</b>

525
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:51,495
<b>- Yes.
- You should have told me sooner.</b>

526
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:52,666
<b>I could have gone with you.</b>

527
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:54,720
<b>Two guys watching a movie
late at night?</b>

528
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,535
<b>Not just any movie, a romance movie?</b>

529
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,235
<b>Just the thought of that
makes me shudder.</b>

530
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:00,089
<b>Yes. That doesn't sound fun.</b>

531
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,930
<b>Will you be okay?</b>

532
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,220
<b>If people spot you,
they'll talk about this.</b>

533
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:06,670
<b>I'm wearing a cap, so I'll be fine.</b>

534
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:10,000
<b>What about Ha Jin? Has she called?</b>

535
00:28:10,309 --> 00:28:11,369
<b>No.</b>

536
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:15,039
<b>And she'll never contact me again.</b>

537
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,410
<b>I thought I sounded like
a bit of a lunatic too.</b>

538
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,279
<b>Okay.</b>

539
00:28:21,079 --> 00:28:24,765
<b>Hey, right.
I heard Ji Won used to like you.</b>

540
00:28:24,789 --> 00:28:25,849
<b>She did?</b>

541
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:29,960
<b>Why is it in the past tense?
She doesn't like me anymore?</b>

542
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:32,059
<b>You're insane.</b>

543
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:35,299
<b>Did you go home today?</b>

544
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:38,329
<b>Yes, my mother told me
to stop by for dinner.</b>

545
00:28:38,769 --> 00:28:40,400
<b>Is Professor Yoo still the same?</b>

546
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:42,345
<b>He's always the same.</b>

547
00:28:42,369 --> 00:28:45,240
<b>He still doesn't approve of his son.</b>

548
00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:48,210
<b>Is that why you're
getting depressed at my place?</b>

549
00:28:48,609 --> 00:28:51,609
<b>Yes, I'm pathetically depressed.</b>

550
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:56,255
<b>So? Do you want me to
cancel the movie and go home?</b>

551
00:28:56,279 --> 00:28:58,250
<b>Forget it. Get lost.</b>

552
00:28:58,549 --> 00:29:00,565
<b>I'm going to sleep
after another can of beer.</b>

553
00:29:00,589 --> 00:29:02,029
<b>Don't wake me when you're back home.</b>

554
00:29:10,099 --> 00:29:11,799
<b>Don't run. We're late anyway.</b>

555
00:29:12,369 --> 00:29:13,400
<b>It's because of you.</b>

556
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:17,315
<b>This is the evacuation plan
in case of an emergency.</b>

557
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:19,745
<b>For your safe experience,</b>

558
00:29:19,769 --> 00:29:21,485
<b>make sure you check
where the emergency lights...</b>

559
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:22,616
<b>and the nearest exit...</b>

560
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,085
<b>Let's see. Is this it? Row K?</b>

561
00:29:25,109 --> 00:29:26,985
<b>- K? Is this it?
- Is this it?</b>

562
00:29:27,009 --> 00:29:29,495
<b>- No, it's the one behind.
- Darn it. This isn't it.</b>

563
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:30,795
<b>She has no eyes.</b>

564
00:29:30,819 --> 00:29:32,995
<b>- Just sit there, okay?
- Please exit safely...</b>

565
00:29:33,019 --> 00:29:33,996
<b>What was that?</b>

566
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:36,235
<b>I have to go to the restroom.</b>

567
00:29:36,259 --> 00:29:38,366
<b>Again? It's probably a disease.</b>

568
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:40,599
<b>- This is the 3rd time.
- The 3rd time?</b>

569
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:48,245
<b>What is this? Is that really
Yeo Ha Jin? She's so pretty.</b>

570
00:29:48,269 --> 00:29:50,670
<b>I told you. She's like a goddess.</b>

571
00:29:51,069 --> 00:29:52,069
<b>Seriously.</b>

572
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:55,015
<b>I can see why
Lee Jeong Hoon fell for her.</b>

573
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:57,809
<b>I hate Lee Jeong Hoon.
He's kind of cheesy.</b>

574
00:29:58,279 --> 00:29:59,779
<b>You're cheesy too.</b>

575
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:02,880
<b>- Do you want to die?
- Be quiet.</b>

576
00:30:03,619 --> 00:30:05,226
<b>You laughed too.</b>

577
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:07,490
<b>Just watch the movie, will you?</b>

578
00:30:08,789 --> 00:30:09,890
<b>Look at her.</b>

579
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:16,029
<b>Look at you.</b>

580
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:19,029
<b>I told you to get changed.
Why are you sleeping here?</b>

581
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:22,500
<b>And why are you eating chips
at this hour? Confiscated.</b>

582
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,085
<b>Why? What's this shooting?</b>

583
00:30:24,109 --> 00:30:25,646
<b>We aren't shooting anything.
We're at home.</b>

584
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:26,647
<b>Right.</b>

585
00:30:26,671 --> 00:30:28,911
<b>We have nothing tomorrow morning,
so go get a good sleep.</b>

586
00:30:30,549 --> 00:30:31,549
<b>My phone.</b>

587
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:33,779
<b>Where's my phone?</b>

588
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:36,519
<b>Here.</b>

589
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:41,359
<b>You should just give him a call.</b>

590
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:44,730
<b>No. It's better not to call him.</b>

591
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:46,765
<b>If he doesn't pick up,
I'll feel even more pathetic.</b>

592
00:30:46,789 --> 00:30:48,606
<b>Then just get over him.</b>

593
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:49,936
<b>You check your phone
for his call every day,</b>

594
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,805
<b>look miserable,
and watch the news every day too.</b>

595
00:30:51,829 --> 00:30:55,240
<b>You're the only one who watches
the news with such a sad face.</b>

596
00:30:56,599 --> 00:30:58,869
<b>I really don't get it.</b>

597
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,740
<b>What's wrong with this guy?</b>

598
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,980
<b>He said I'm a good person.
He said he wants me to be happy.</b>

599
00:31:04,049 --> 00:31:06,456
<b>Then he never wants to see me again.
So what's going on?</b>

600
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,525
<b>What is this?</b>

601
00:31:07,549 --> 00:31:10,180
<b>Gosh, that again.
You said that over 100 times.</b>

602
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,819
<b>It's because
I don't have the answer.</b>

603
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:18,089
<b>Just consider him insane
and forget about it.</b>

604
00:31:18,329 --> 00:31:20,406
<b>You aren't the Yeo Ha Jin
you used to be.</b>

605
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:23,759
<b>You're now everyone's first love.
You have nothing to be sorry for.</b>

606
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,400
<b>It's just a phase
thanks to my movie.</b>

607
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:28,769
<b>That's a good attitude.</b>

608
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,240
<b>Do you think he watched my movie?</b>

609
00:31:32,369 --> 00:31:33,386
<b>Why would he watch your movie?</b>

610
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:37,450
<b>I mean, people who hated me
began to like me after watching it.</b>

611
00:31:37,779 --> 00:31:39,856
<b>So? Do you think
he will fall for you...</b>

612
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,726
<b>after he watches the movie?</b>

613
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:42,755
<b>Yes.</b>

614
00:31:42,779 --> 00:31:44,226
<b>Don't get hopeful.</b>

615
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:46,696
<b>If he watched your movie
after turning you down many times,</b>

616
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,319
<b>that means he's really crazy.</b>

617
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:52,430
<b>It was too much for me.</b>

618
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,630
<b>It was too tough.</b>

619
00:31:58,569 --> 00:32:00,029
<b>I couldn't breathe.</b>

620
00:32:03,369 --> 00:32:04,640
<b>I was too scared...</b>

621
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,880
<b>all of the times
I'll have to spend...</b>

622
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,509
<b>without you.</b>

623
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:19,690
<b>Could I forget about you now?</b>

624
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:26,529
<b>I know I'm shameless,</b>

625
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:31,700
<b>but could I...</b>

626
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,470
<b>forget you and move on?</b>

627
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:40,579
<b>I can't even imagine
how she must be feeling.</b>

628
00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:44,210
<b>Living a life
without precious memories.</b>

629
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:48,349
<b>Which one of us is more pitiful?</b>

630
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:51,490
<b>Me who can't forget my memories
for the rest of my life?</b>

631
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:55,190
<b>Or Ha Jin who had to forget
her memories to live?</b>

632
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:05,290
<b>What?</b>

633
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:06,637
<b>Really?</b>

634
00:33:06,661 --> 00:33:07,865
<b>I'm telling you.</b>

635
00:33:07,889 --> 00:33:09,405
<b>I noticed him as soon as I went in.</b>

636
00:33:09,429 --> 00:33:10,435
<b>It was Lee Jeong Hoon.</b>

637
00:33:10,459 --> 00:33:11,505
<b>My gosh!</b>

638
00:33:11,529 --> 00:33:14,776
<b>Then did he come here alone to watch
his girlfriend's movie at this hour?</b>

639
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,046
<b>My gosh.
He must really love Yeo Ha Jin.</b>

640
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:19,075
<b>Hey, let's go.
I want to see him too.</b>

641
00:33:19,099 --> 00:33:20,239
<b>Wait, no.</b>

642
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:22,309
<b>Let's stay here for now.</b>

643
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:24,239
<b>- You want to stay here?
- Yes.</b>

644
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,640
<b>Why?</b>

645
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,289
<b>(Episode 8)</b>

646
00:33:42,329 --> 00:33:43,405
<b>Hey, get him.</b>

647
00:33:43,429 --> 00:33:44,835
<b>- I'll take this side first.
- Take the picture.</b>

648
00:33:44,859 --> 00:33:45,836
<b>My gosh!</b>

649
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,205
<b>- This is huge!
- Please stop.</b>

650
00:33:47,229 --> 00:33:48,345
<b>- His face is tiny!
- Please don't take pictures.</b>

651
00:33:48,369 --> 00:33:49,875
<b>Smile, girls. Let's go.</b>

652
00:33:49,899 --> 00:33:51,299
<b>- Goodbye!
- Goodbye!</b>

653
00:33:52,439 --> 00:33:53,945
<b>I take back
that I called you cheesy!</b>

654
00:33:53,969 --> 00:33:55,716
<b>I hope you and Ha Jin
stay in love for a long time!</b>

655
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,216
<b>This is huge.
He has such a tiny face.</b>

656
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,539
<b>- Yes!
- My gosh!</b>

657
00:33:58,939 --> 00:34:01,079
<b>That was like a terrorist attack.</b>

658
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:27,939
<b>What am I doing?</b>

659
00:34:41,019 --> 00:34:42,066
<b>What is this?</b>

660
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:43,970
<b>(I ran into Lee Jeong Hoon
at the movies today.)</b>

<b>Ha Kyung!</b>

662
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,099
<b>Ha Kyung! Wake up!</b>

663
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,530
<b>Come on.</b>

664
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,016
<b>There's no time to sleep.</b>

665
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,775
<b>Wake up. Hurry. Wake up.</b>

666
00:34:58,799 --> 00:35:00,810
<b>- Okay?
- What? What is it?</b>

667
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:04,215
<b>No! We're late for the interview!</b>

668
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:06,085
<b>No, we aren't late.
It's not the evening.</b>

669
00:35:06,109 --> 00:35:07,579
<b>It's 5:30 a.m.</b>

670
00:35:07,909 --> 00:35:08,980
<b>In the morning?</b>

671
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,596
<b>Why aren't you asleep?</b>

672
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:12,056
<b>I woke up to go to the restroom,</b>

673
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,849
<b>then checked
my social media for a second...</b>

674
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,795
<b>and found out Jeong Hoon
went to watch my movie yesterday,</b>

675
00:35:16,819 --> 00:35:18,665
<b>and he went all by himself
for the late-night show.</b>

676
00:35:18,689 --> 00:35:20,259
<b>- What?
- Look.</b>

677
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:23,476
<b>Someone who watched the movie...</b>

678
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,099
<b>in the same movie theater
uploaded that.</b>

679
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,976
<b>She said...</b>

680
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,575
<b>he cried a lot
while he watched the movie.</b>

681
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:31,915
<b>He must've gotten
overly emotional...</b>

682
00:35:31,939 --> 00:35:34,509
<b>because he didn't leave
for a long time even after it ended.</b>

683
00:35:35,909 --> 00:35:37,509
<b>Is he really insane?</b>

684
00:35:38,009 --> 00:35:39,210
<b>It looks like...</b>

685
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:41,479
<b>I should probably contact him first.</b>

686
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:45,156
<b>Why are you taking things that way?</b>

687
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,849
<b>Think about it.</b>

688
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:49,520
<b>Why do you think he suddenly went
to watch my movie that late?</b>

689
00:35:50,389 --> 00:35:51,960
<b>He probably couldn't sleep.</b>

690
00:35:52,219 --> 00:35:53,966
<b>Of course, it's because of me.</b>

691
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:55,906
<b>He missed me.</b>

692
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:57,336
<b>That was an easy question.</b>

693
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,605
<b>It's so obvious.</b>

694
00:35:58,629 --> 00:36:00,205
<b>I think you're right.</b>

695
00:36:00,229 --> 00:36:01,675
<b>You'll never date anyone.</b>

696
00:36:01,699 --> 00:36:02,900
<b>You're right.</b>

697
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,840
<b>Do you think so too?</b>

698
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,409
<b>Yes.</b>

699
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,485
<b>I'll contact him first.</b>

700
00:36:09,509 --> 00:36:11,180
<b>Do whatever you want.</b>

701
00:36:11,409 --> 00:36:12,810
<b>Okay. Go back to sleep.</b>

702
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,976
<b>I'm going to work

<b>Will you please buy some food?</b>

704
00:36:34,729 --> 00:36:35,930
<b>What's wrong with your house?</b>

<b>Drive.</b>

<b>To where?</b>

729
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:52,100
<b>Anywhere. Just step on it.</b>

730
00:39:56,970 --> 00:39:58,216
<b>You always had that drink?</b>

731

<b>By the way, why do we need to talk?</b>

735

<b>I was taken aback.</b>

736

<b>I didn't know you'd go watch
my movie alone.</b>

737
00:40:23,189 --> 00:40:25,459
<b>So I thought long and hard...</b>

00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:27,569
<b>about what to do...</b>

739

<b>I know you regret saying

<b>last time we were here.</b>

745

<b>So I'm going to give you

746

<b>What do you...</b>

747
00:40:50,589 --> 00:40:52,689
<b>Not yet. I'm not done talking.</b>

748
00:40:54,829 --> 00:40:58,005
<b>Is it because you feel pressured
about dating a celebrity?</b>

749
00:40:58,029 --> 00:41:00,870
<b>No. It's not like that at all.</b>

750
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:02,805
<b>I watched your movie...</b>

751
00:41:02,829 --> 00:41:04,476
<b>because I had to interview

<b>You have an interview

755

<b>Then let me ask you one question.</b>

756
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:25,560
<b>Did you ever think about me
during the past several days?</b>

757
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:29,089
<b>Or did you forget about me?</b>

758
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,660
<b>Well...</b>

759
00:41:33,629 --> 00:41:37,269
<b>I'm not the type who forgets easily.</b>

760
00:41:39,269 --> 00:41:41,970
<b>Does that mean you thought about me?</b>

761
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:44,710
<b>I guess you didn't forget about me.</b>

762
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:47,950
<b>I'm glad.</b>

763
00:41:48,649 --> 00:41:50,169
<b>I'm going to keep
misunderstanding you.</b>

764
00:41:50,649 --> 00:41:52,655
<b>I'm going to think that
you watched that movie...</b>

765
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:53,750
<b>because you missed me.</b>

766
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:54,966
<b>Why...</b>

767
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:56,590
<b>I'm quite popular these days.</b>

768
00:41:57,090 --> 00:41:59,836
<b>I shot advertisements, photoshoots,
and interviews.</b>

769
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:02,135
<b>Many directors want me
in their dramas.</b>

770
00:42:02,159 --> 00:42:04,100
<b>I'm getting fewer hate comments now.</b>

771
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:06,259
<b>People are starting to like me more.</b>

772
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:11,269
<b>But I'm not that elated.</b>

773
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:16,110
<b>The past me
would've been exhilarated.</b>

774
00:42:18,379 --> 00:42:20,850
<b>I think it's because of you.</b>

775
00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:23,809
<b>You said...</b>

776
00:42:25,279 --> 00:42:27,919
<b>we were just going back
to our places.</b>

777
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:29,889
<b>You said it was simple.</b>

778
00:42:32,059 --> 00:42:33,519
<b>But that's not the case for me.</b>

779
00:42:34,759 --> 00:42:36,330
<b>I need more time.</b>

780
00:42:37,029 --> 00:42:39,000
<b>Everyone has their own pace.</b>

781
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:44,039
<b>I'm a bit surprised by your answer.</b>

782
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:47,340
<b>I guess I really wanted this
to work out.</b>

783
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:51,710
<b>So let me misunderstand you
for the time being.</b>

784
00:42:51,809 --> 00:42:54,450
<b>Who knows? Perhaps, it's not
a misunderstanding.</b>

785
00:42:55,649 --> 00:42:58,549
<b>Maybe you need more time...</b>

786
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:00,919
<b>to become honest with me.</b>

787
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:05,836
<b>Do as you please.</b>

788
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:08,529
<b>You can ignore my calls and block...</b>

789
00:43:08,929 --> 00:43:12,100
<b>No. Don't block me.</b>

790
00:43:12,529 --> 00:43:15,169
<b>If you ignore me for too long,
I might barge into your house.</b>

791
00:43:16,029 --> 00:43:18,139
<b>Don't forget that I know
where you live.</b>

792
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:21,039
<b>Is that a threat?</b>

793
00:43:22,370 --> 00:43:23,809
<b>Not really.</b>

794
00:43:26,509 --> 00:43:30,250
<b>Right, how was the movie?
Was it interesting?</b>

795
00:43:34,289 --> 00:43:36,190
<b>Was it that bad?</b>

796
00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:40,265
<b>It was interesting.</b>

797
00:43:40,289 --> 00:43:43,029
<b>Really? How was my acting?</b>

798
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:45,460
<b>It was good.</b>

799
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,200
<b>Your role suited you.</b>

800
00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:50,700
<b>I can understand why people like it.</b>

801
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:55,009
<b>Oh, right. I wasn't going
to take much of your time.</b>

802
00:43:56,009 --> 00:43:57,679
<b>Thank you for sparing your time.</b>

803
00:43:57,980 --> 00:43:59,216
<b>I'm done talking...</b>

804
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,210
<b>although this wasn't
what I had anticipated.</b>

805
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:06,620
<b>I'm sorry, but can you call a cab?</b>

806
00:44:06,919 --> 00:44:10,019
<b>I feel awkward about driving
you home after this talk.</b>

807
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:12,097
<b>Sure.</b>

808
00:44:12,121 --> 00:44:13,720
<b>Then I'll be leaving now.</b>

809
00:44:31,139 --> 00:44:32,309
<b>Gosh.</b>

810
00:44:33,539 --> 00:44:36,586
<b>I couldn't find you.
I thought you ran away.</b>

811
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:38,179
<b>Maybe I should have.</b>

812
00:44:38,419 --> 00:44:40,426
<b>Don't get smart with me.</b>

813

<b>You're all dressed up.</b>

814
00:44:42,350 --> 00:44:44,495
<b>Do I really need to go?</b>

815
00:44:44,519 --> 00:44:45,620
<b>Of course.</b>

819

<b>I can change in a jiffy.</b>

<b>You weren't in your office.

<b>Didn't you say...</b>
