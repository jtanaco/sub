<b>"What we've prepared"?</b>

620
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,745
<b>She should be arriving soon.</b>

621
01:01:48,690 --> 01:01:50,435
<b>In my opinion...</b>

622
01:01:50,690 --> 01:01:53,159
<b>Why don't you nullify
the existing contract</b>

623
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:54,429
<b>and sign a new contract</b>

624
01:01:54,430 --> 01:01:57,035
<b>with a better offer?</b>

625
01:01:57,100 --> 01:01:58,575
<b>Absolutely not.</b>

626
01:01:59,070 --> 01:02:01,069
<b>I can't move anywhere.</b>

627
01:02:01,070 --> 01:02:02,175
<b>Sorry?</b>

628
01:02:02,270 --> 01:02:04,185
<b>I don't care how much money it'll take.</b>

629
01:02:04,210 --> 01:02:06,315
<b>Compensate for their loss</b>

630
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:08,255
<b>and purchase the property again.</b>

631
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:13,755
<b>Let me ask something out of curiosity.</b>

632
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:17,789
<b>The land involved in this lawsuit is</b>

633
01:02:17,790 --> 01:02:20,549
<b>nothing more than
a small hill in a small town</b>

634
01:02:20,550 --> 01:02:22,859
<b>without much value.</b>

635
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:25,529
<b>Why do you insist</b>

636
01:02:25,530 --> 01:02:26,935
<b>that you keep this land?</b>

637
01:02:29,330 --> 01:02:31,905
<b>You can see my mother's hometown
from here.</b>

638
01:02:32,770 --> 01:02:35,345
<b>I see.</b>

639
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:38,509
<b>Who purchased the hill?</b>

640
01:02:38,510 --> 01:02:40,469
<b>It's someone from Donghan International.</b>

641
01:02:40,470 --> 01:02:41,655
<b>What did you say?</b>

642
01:02:48,950 --> 01:02:50,525
<b>[ Open the door. ]</b>

643
01:02:51,820 --> 01:02:53,025
<b>Hyun-a!</b>

644
01:02:54,190 --> 01:02:57,359
<b>Your beloved Designer Bella is in Korea.</b>

645
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:58,735
<b>Don't you want to meet her?</b>

646
01:02:59,390 --> 01:03:01,635
<b>I have a meeting with her tomorrow.</b>

647
01:03:02,630 --> 01:03:04,845
<b>Are you still going to stay in your room?</b>

648
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:08,915
<b>Bella?</b>

649
01:03:12,010 --> 01:03:13,945
<b>[ Managing Director Lim Chul-yong ]</b>

650
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:16,185
<b>[ of Donghan International

651
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:17,425
<b>[ Then ]</b>

652
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:20,719
<b>[ - is it the company buying the land?
- Yes. ]</b>

653
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:23,995
<b>[ It'd be best if you two meet and talk. ]</b>

654
01:03:24,150 --> 01:03:26,549
<b>[ He's a simple man ]</b>

655
01:03:26,550 --> 01:03:29,165
<b>[ that you can talk things out with. ]</b>

656
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:31,435
<b>[ Sure, then. ]</b>

657
01:03:51,250 --> 01:03:54,895
<b>How much did it cost you to buy the land?</b>

658
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:57,219
<b>I'll give you the money.</b>

659
01:03:57,220 --> 01:03:58,295
<b>No,</b>

660
01:03:59,290 --> 01:04:01,095
<b>I'll double it.</b>

661
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:03,959
<b>We purchased the land</b>

662
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:06,765
<b>to expand our manufacturing and storage.</b>

663
01:04:07,190 --> 01:04:09,499
<b>It'd be malpractice if I make the call</b>

664
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:11,645
<b>based on my personal thoughts.</b>

665
01:04:12,730 --> 01:04:14,175
<b>I'll triple the money.</b>

666
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:17,015
<b>Wouldn't that be a profitable deal?</b>

667
01:04:20,010 --> 01:04:24,185
<b>That's not the only way to make a profit.</b>

668

<b>Yu-jin,</b>

<b>Don't be too surprised.</b>

673
01:04:39,860 --> 01:04:42,535
<b>I'm the only one who knows.</b>

674
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:44,345
<b>For now, at least.</b>

675
01:04:47,370 --> 01:04:50,045
<b>I'll be straightforward with you.</b>

676

<b>I know your contract with Louis is over.</b>

<b>Why not?</b>

680
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:07,065
<b>After all,</b>

681
01:05:07,990 --> 01:05:09,335
<b>I know</b>

<b>Yoo Hyo-myoung.</b>

<b>Your mother's death was unfortunate.</b>

685

<b>She was a beautiful model

<b>How did you find out?</b>

687
01:05:38,990 --> 01:05:40,859
<b>A close friend of hers was</b>

<b>You should be a detective instead.</b>

692
01:05:55,100 --> 01:05:58,439
<b>A good manager needs
good information sources.</b>

693
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:00,085
<b>I'll take it as a compliment.</b>

694
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:04,085
<b>But...</b>

695
01:06:05,010 --> 01:06:08,395
<b>I have no interest in working with you.</b>

696

<b>I think it was wise of you</b>

<b>Wouldn't it be so tragic...</b>

<b>What do you think?</b>

705
01:07:40,290 --> 01:07:41,635
<b>I'll see you at court.</b>

706

<b>It'd be better for my mind to sue you</b>

<b>Who are you?</b>

714
01:08:23,730 --> 01:08:25,075
<b>Don't you see the cars behind you?</b>

715
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:27,869
<b>I have to get going.</b>

<b>What a ridiculous family you are.</b>

<b>What are you going to do now?</b>

725

<b>What?</b>

726

<b>But don't you think it's weird?</b>

732
01:09:22,490 --> 01:09:24,928
<b>The mom must have a reason</b>

<b>why she left her with you.</b>

734

<b>It's too mean to just send her away.</b>

735

<b>Do I look like a charity to you?</b>

<b>I've never seen her

<b>So why should I keep her?</b>

01:10:20,150 --> 01:10:22,025
<b>I was impressed at first,</b>

<b>but I can see it clearly</b>

746
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:27,835
<b>now that I've looked into them.</b>

747

<b>Plagiarized?</b>

<b>What are you talking about?</b>

750
01:10:38,070 --> 01:10:42,209
<b>And you made things worse

<b>You're mistaken.</b>
