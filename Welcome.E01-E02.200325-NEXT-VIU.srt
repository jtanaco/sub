2

<b>I asked if it wanted to follow me home, and it did.</b>

3

<b>My dog reminds me of myself.</b>

5
00:00:15,506 --> 00:00:17,546
<b>I tried really hard to find the owner,</b>

6
00:00:17,546 --> 00:00:19,647
<b>but the owner never showed up.</b>

7
00:00:19,647 --> 00:00:21,316
<b>It cried all night.</b>

8
00:00:21,316 --> 00:00:22,846
<b>It was so small and black.</b>

9
00:00:22,846 --> 00:00:24,816
<b>I used to be a bit depressed.</b>

10

<b>My dog saved my life.</b>

11
00:00:25,947 --> 00:00:27,557
<b>She was born at my house.</b>

12
00:00:27,557 --> 00:00:30,557
<b>She was so little and couldn't open her eyes. She was adorable.</b>

13

<b>I adopted my dog after I saw his mother.</b>

14

<b>I was supposed to take care of it for just a few days.</b>

15
00:00:34,426 --> 00:00:35,557
<b>But it grew on me.</b>

16
00:00:35,557 --> 00:00:37,057
<b>Her name is Winter.</b>

17
00:00:37,057 --> 00:00:38,127
<b>He's four years old.</b>

18
00:00:38,127 --> 00:00:40,297
<b>He was wandering in the rain.</b>

19
00:00:40,297 --> 00:00:41,867
<b>Her ears were so clean.</b>

20
00:00:41,867 --> 00:00:43,136
<b>He was so adorable.</b>

21
00:00:43,136 --> 00:00:44,507
<b>She has a big appetite.</b>

22
00:00:44,507 --> 00:00:45,966
<b>She's so cute and adorable.</b>

23
00:00:45,966 --> 00:00:47,606
<b>He gets scared easily.</b>

24
00:00:47,606 --> 00:00:49,082
<b>She is a puppy-like cat.</b>

25
00:01:11,866 --> 00:01:13,001
<b>Give it to me.</b>

26
00:01:14,566 --> 00:01:16,111
<b>I said give it to me.</b>

27
00:01:16,336 --> 00:01:18,581
<b>No, not you.</b>

28
00:01:19,566 --> 00:01:20,982

29
00:01:21,036 --> 00:01:22,411

33
00:01:43,827 --> 00:01:45,641

<b>You're being hostile.</b>

160
00:09:58,526 --> 00:10:00,902
<b>What's your problem? Your dad is in love.</b>

161
00:10:01,026 --> 00:10:02,571
<b>And now, it's your turn.</b>

162
00:10:03,156 --> 00:10:05,642
<b>I heard Jae Seon is going to start a cafe.</b>

163
00:10:06,467 --> 00:10:09,067
<b>Good for him. Although it has nothing to do with me.</b>

164
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:10,312
<b>Do you know what it's going to be called?</b>

165
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,211
<b>"Sonamu".</b>

166
00:10:12,906 --> 00:10:14,142
<b>Kim Sol Ah.</b>

167
00:10:14,307 --> 00:10:16,081
<b>Don't you see the connection?</b>

168
00:10:17,376 --> 00:10:18,652
<b>You're being ridiculous.</b>

169
00:10:18,906 --> 00:10:21,221
<b>- Don't you want to meet him? - No, why would I meet him?</b>

170
00:10:21,546 --> 00:10:22,792
<b>Hey, Jae Seon.</b>

171
00:10:25,746 --> 00:10:27,191
<b>You do want to meet him.</b>

172
00:10:27,746 --> 00:10:30,562
<b>And you want to die, right?</b>

173
00:10:30,817 --> 00:10:32,026
<b>Hey, come on.</b>

174
00:10:32,026 --> 00:10:34,772
<b>You guys knew each other for so long. Lee Ru Bi?</b>

175
00:10:34,996 --> 00:10:38,042
<b>He only dated her for a year, and they're done for good.</b>

176
00:10:38,266 --> 00:10:39,396
<b>They dated for 10 months.</b>

177
00:10:39,396 --> 00:10:41,672
<b>My gosh, you even kept count?</b>

178
00:10:43,366 --> 00:10:45,707
<b>Jae Seon dated other girls too.</b>

179
00:10:45,707 --> 00:10:47,282
<b>Why are you trying to cut ties?</b>

180
00:10:48,437 --> 00:10:49,782
<b>By any chance,</b>

181
00:10:50,406 --> 00:10:52,081
<b>did something happen between you two?</b>

182
00:11:18,607 --> 00:11:20,512
<b>Why do you always sit behind me like that?</b>

183
00:11:22,477 --> 00:11:24,412
<b>Why are you always here?</b>

184
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:26,721
<b>You know why.</b>

185
00:11:28,447 --> 00:11:29,591
<b>That's why...</b>

186
00:11:30,646 --> 00:11:32,721
<b>you always come join me.</b>

187
00:11:37,987 --> 00:11:39,701
<b>How long is this going to last?</b>

188
00:11:41,427 --> 00:11:42,502
<b>What do you mean?</b>

189
00:11:44,597 --> 00:11:46,571
<b>We're not exactly sitting next to each other.</b>

190
00:11:47,626 --> 00:11:49,772
<b>But at the same time, we kind of are.</b>

191
00:12:06,546 --> 00:12:08,191
<b>What am I...</b>

192
00:12:10,487 --> 00:12:11,562
<b>to you?</b>

193
00:12:16,427 --> 00:12:17,932
<b>"What am I to you?"</b>

194
00:12:18,266 --> 00:12:20,101
<b>Don't tell me you said something like that to him.</b>

195
00:12:20,266 --> 00:12:22,471
<b>- I would never. - I guess you're right.</b>

196
00:12:22,967 --> 00:12:25,136
<b>You lack common sense, but it's not that bad.</b>

197
00:12:25,136 --> 00:12:27,211
<b>Hey, what's so bad about that?</b>

198
00:12:27,307 --> 00:12:28,937
<b>It's even worse not being able to say that.</b>

199
00:12:28,937 --> 00:12:31,347
<b>Then go ahead and say it. There he is.</b>

200
00:12:31,347 --> 00:12:32,481
<b>Hey, Jae Seon.</b>

201
00:12:33,006 --> 00:12:35,616
<b>He'll probably stand there with a straight face trying to look cool.</b>

202
00:12:35,616 --> 00:12:37,516
<b>I bet he'll look at me with his sparkly eyes...</b>

203
00:12:37,516 --> 00:12:38,821
<b>and say this with his low voice.</b>

204
00:12:39,116 --> 00:12:40,361
<b>"Long time no see."</b>

205
00:12:45,987 --> 00:12:47,162
<b>Long time no see.</b>

206
00:12:48,427 --> 00:12:50,402
<b>You said you wanted coffee.</b>

207
00:12:51,526 --> 00:12:53,371
<b>That's his cafe. It opened today.</b>

208
00:12:57,097 --> 00:12:59,581
<b>Hey, Sol Ah. Are you leaving?</b>

209
00:12:59,937 --> 00:13:01,451
<b>Hey, don't go.</b>

210
00:13:18,057 --> 00:13:19,532
<b>I had the same dream again.</b>

211
00:13:21,227 --> 00:13:22,471
<b>My first memory.</b>

212
00:13:26,026 --> 00:13:27,601
<b>And in that memory,</b>

213
00:13:33,207 --> 00:13:34,441
<b>I was a human.</b>

214
00:13:42,146 --> 00:13:43,821
<b>Why won't you make a sound?</b>

215
00:13:44,746 --> 00:13:46,591
<b>Will I hear something if I press the button?</b>

216
00:13:50,592 --> 00:13:55,592


217
00:14:00,927 --> 00:14:02,672
<b>Maybe it's not even a memory.</b>

218
00:14:03,636 --> 00:14:05,111
<b>Maybe it was just a dream.</b>

219
00:14:18,717 --> 00:14:19,892
<b>Gosh, no.</b>

220
00:14:22,756 --> 00:14:23,786
<b>Sol Ah.</b>

221
00:14:23,786 --> 00:14:25,286
<b>(Sol Ah)</b>

222
00:14:25,286 --> 00:14:26,687
<b>Sonamu.</b>

223
00:14:26,687 --> 00:14:28,756
<b>(Sonamu)</b>

224
00:14:28,756 --> 00:14:30,032
<b>They're kind of similar.</b>

225
00:14:31,296 --> 00:14:32,727
<b>Sonamu.</b>

226
00:14:32,727 --> 00:14:34,302
<b>(Sonamu)</b>

00:14:37,337 --> 00:14:40,581
<b>(Kim Sol Ah)</b>

229
00:14:44,337 --> 00:14:45,981
<b>What am I...</b>

230
00:14:48,246 --> 00:14:49,392
<b>to you?</b>

231
00:14:49,776 --> 00:14:50,991
<b>You want to know...</b>

232
00:14:51,987 --> 00:14:53,091
<b>what you are to me?</b>

233
00:14:58,126 --> 00:14:59,262
<b>You're...</b>

234
00:15:05,896 --> 00:15:07,042
<b>Kim Sol Ah.</b>

235
00:15:09,837 --> 00:15:11,711
<b>You're Kim Sol Ah.</b>

236
00:15:22,947 --> 00:15:24,152
<b>What's with your face?</b>

237
00:15:24,717 --> 00:15:27,022
<b>What? What are you talking about?</b>

238
00:15:32,357 --> 00:15:34,002
<b>I didn't expect that from you.</b>

239
00:15:35,526 --> 00:15:36,632
<b>What?</b>

240
00:15:37,597 --> 00:15:38,741
<b>Expect what?</b>

241
00:15:39,697 --> 00:15:40,772
<b>You're blushing.</b>

242
00:16:06,126 --> 00:16:07,656
<b>Then he never called.</b>

243
00:16:07,656 --> 00:16:09,201
<b>He fell for someone rich.</b>

244
00:16:09,796 --> 00:16:11,741
<b>I shouldn't go. If I go,</b>

245
00:16:11,827 --> 00:16:15,042
<b>then I'm a dog. Not just a dog but a mad dog.</b>

246
00:16:22,937 --> 00:16:26,351
<b>(Sonamu)</b>

247
00:16:28,376 --> 00:16:29,491
<b>You're here.</b>

248
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:32,646
<b>I had to come by at least once.</b>

249
00:16:32,646 --> 00:16:35,856
<b>We're friends. And I'm the designer.</b>

250
00:16:35,857 --> 00:16:38,016
<b>So, the sign's okay,</b>

251
00:16:38,016 --> 00:16:41,386
<b>and the interior might go out of fashion but it's fresh.</b>

252
00:16:41,386 --> 00:16:43,402
<b>I'm done looking. I should go now. Bye.</b>

253
00:16:44,097 --> 00:16:45,441
<b>Jae Seon!</b>

254
00:16:46,026 --> 00:16:47,302
<b>Sol Ah's here.</b>

255
00:16:47,567 --> 00:16:48,812
<b>Hey.</b>

256
00:16:55,837 --> 00:16:57,111
<b>He must be busy.</b>

257
00:16:58,646 --> 00:16:59,882
<b>Let's sit over here.</b>

258
00:17:06,447 --> 00:17:07,692
<b>Aren't you proud of him?</b>

259
00:17:07,846 --> 00:17:10,462
<b>He set up all this on his own while you were apart.</b>

260
00:17:34,447 --> 00:17:35,745
<b>Drink this and go.</b>

261
00:17:35,746 --> 00:17:36,952
<b>Thank you.</b>

262
00:17:37,217 --> 00:17:39,117
<b>What? "Go"?</b>

263
00:17:39,117 --> 00:17:41,661
<b>Drink this and then go.</b>

264
00:17:42,516 --> 00:17:44,016
<b>That is just harsh.</b>

265
00:17:44,016 --> 00:17:46,657
<b>Why is he so frigid when he shouldn't be?</b>

266
00:17:46,657 --> 00:17:49,496
<b>No. He acts all frigid,</b>

267
00:17:49,496 --> 00:17:51,631
<b>but Jae Seon waited for you all along.</b>

268
00:17:51,867 --> 00:17:53,096
<b>Oh, really?</b>

269
00:17:53,096 --> 00:17:55,641
<b>Yes. Look at him.</b>

270
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:58,141
<b>He was like that for a while.</b>

271
00:17:58,506 --> 00:18:00,841
<b>Staring out the window.</b>

272
00:18:01,606 --> 00:18:04,651
<b>He's waiting and waiting.</b>

273
00:18:05,147 --> 00:18:06,782
<b>He's still...</b>

274
00:18:07,877 --> 00:18:09,252
<b>waiting.</b>

275
00:18:16,286 --> 00:18:17,931
<b>Who is he waiting for?</b>

276
00:18:18,217 --> 00:18:19,361
<b>Wait here.</b>

277
00:18:20,086 --> 00:18:22,401
<b>Hey. Who are you waiting for?</b>

278
00:18:24,826 --> 00:18:26,396
<b>I doubt he'll come.</b>

279
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:27,542
<b>You mean...</b>

280
00:18:28,867 --> 00:18:30,371
<b>That woman Ru Bi?</b>

281
00:18:30,467 --> 00:18:32,766
<b>Jae Seon. Is that who you're waiting for?</b>

282
00:18:32,766 --> 00:18:33,982
<b>No.</b>

283
00:18:34,306 --> 00:18:37,377
<b>Hey, what's this? A present for her?</b>

284
00:18:37,377 --> 00:18:39,745
<b>- I said no. - As if it's not.</b>

285
00:18:39,746 --> 00:18:41,022
<b>Look at it.</b>

286
00:18:41,207 --> 00:18:43,117
<b>It has the initials too.</b>

287
00:18:43,117 --> 00:18:45,062
<b>K. Y. Lee.</b>

288
00:18:49,856 --> 00:18:51,085
<b>Who's that?</b>

289
00:18:51,086 --> 00:18:54,032
<b>My English may be poor, but I know it's not Ru Bi.</b>

290
00:18:58,227 --> 00:18:59,641
<b>My father.</b>

291
00:19:02,496 --> 00:19:04,736
<b>He still won't see you?</b>

292
00:19:04,737 --> 00:19:07,712
<b>When did you quit studying law abroad to learn leather crafting?</b>

293
00:19:07,937 --> 00:19:09,651
<b>Hasn't it been 6, 7 years already?</b>

294
00:19:10,336 --> 00:19:12,881
<b>It's time he got over it.</b>

295
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:23,931
<b>I'm the pitiful one, so why is he so pitiful?</b>

296
00:19:26,657 --> 00:19:28,202
<b>A human...</b>

297
00:19:28,397 --> 00:19:30,232
<b>could open the door and leave.</b>

298

<b>Sergei. I told you not to scratch the door.</b>

299

<b>Do you know how much all the furniture you ruined cost?</b>

300
00:19:49,617 --> 00:19:50,992
<b>Let's go out.</b>

301
00:19:51,987 --> 00:19:53,792
<b>If you want to leave that much.</b>

302
00:20:09,937 --> 00:20:13,482
<b>My future in-laws detest cats.</b>

303
00:20:13,836 --> 00:20:15,081
<b>Take it.</b>

<b>(Devoted Mr. Gogalbi)</b>

<b>I'm serious.</b>

00:20:36,356 --> 00:20:38,431
<b>I said no!</b>

307
00:20:38,467 --> 00:20:40,596
<b>I can't put a cat in charge of fish.</b>

<b>Please, Mom. Just for a few days.</b>

<b>- Why... - Say yes.</b>

<b>It's just for a few days.</b>

<b>A few days? A few days?</b>

<b>Then can we run a business or not?</b>

<b>I'll look after it in my room.</b>

318
00:21:06,356 --> 00:21:07,631
<b>As if!</b>

319
00:21:07,987 --> 00:21:10,472
<b>Do you know how much work that is?</b>

320
00:21:10,596 --> 00:21:12,071
<b>It's a no.</b>

321
00:21:12,397 --> 00:21:14,401
<b>No. I said no!</b>

322
00:21:27,977 --> 00:21:29,192
<b>(Devoted Mr. Gogalbi)</b>

323
00:21:37,157 --> 00:21:38,702
<b>Where's Jae Seon? Did he leave?</b>

324
00:21:39,026 --> 00:21:40,161
<b>Yes.</b>

325
00:21:46,496 --> 00:21:48,871
<b>Are they both dumped by her?</b>

326
00:21:50,336 --> 00:21:51,542
<b>Kim Sol Ah.</b>

327
00:21:51,737 --> 00:21:53,111
<b>You take it.</b>

328
00:21:53,566 --> 00:21:54,766
<b>Her cat?</b>

329
00:21:54,766 --> 00:21:56,877
<b>It's Jae Seon's cat. He bought it for her,</b>

330
00:21:56,877 --> 00:21:58,312
<b>and she returned it.</b>

331
00:21:59,407 --> 00:22:02,246
<b>Then he should keep it.</b>

332
00:22:02,246 --> 00:22:04,217
<b>You know he can't keep it.</b>

333
00:22:04,217 --> 00:22:05,562
<b>Don't you feel bad for him?</b>

334
00:22:05,717 --> 00:22:08,631
<b>He won't be able to ask anyone else.</b>

335
00:22:09,117 --> 00:22:10,992
<b>There's no one but us.</b>

336
00:22:11,586 --> 00:22:13,756
<b>What? You don't feel sorry for him?</b>

337
00:22:13,756 --> 00:22:15,631
<b>Oh, forget it.</b>

338
00:22:58,036 --> 00:22:59,411
<b>What is it called?</b>

339
00:23:02,937 --> 00:23:04,081
<b>It doesn't have a name?</b>

340
00:23:04,237 --> 00:23:08,052
<b>Something like Kitty or Meowster?</b>

341
00:23:09,046 --> 00:23:10,252
<b>Sergei.</b>

342
00:23:10,276 --> 00:23:11,921
<b>"Sergei"?</b>

343
00:23:13,187 --> 00:23:14,722
<b>What kind of name is that?</b>

344
00:23:16,816 --> 00:23:19,462
<b>Sergei Rachmaninoff.</b>

345
00:23:20,387 --> 00:23:22,202
<b>What kind of name is that for a cat?</b>

346
00:23:24,197 --> 00:23:26,671
<b>Did she name it?</b>

347
00:23:31,867 --> 00:23:33,012
<b>Are you crying?</b>

348
00:23:34,637 --> 00:23:35,911
<b>I'm not crying.</b>

349
00:23:37,536 --> 00:23:38,952
<b>Look at you.</b>

350
00:23:39,477 --> 00:23:42,052
<b>Lee Jae Seon's crying over a woman.</b>

351
00:23:42,147 --> 00:23:43,851
<b>It's not over a woman.</b>

352
00:23:44,576 --> 00:23:46,161
<b>Then what is it about?</b>

353
00:23:47,546 --> 00:23:49,131
<b>I'm allergic to cats.</b>

354
00:24:01,227 --> 00:24:02,442
<b>Hand it over.</b>

355
00:24:03,496 --> 00:24:05,071
<b>Hand it over.</b>

356
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:09,407
<b>No. Not to you.</b>

357
00:24:09,407 --> 00:24:10,681
<b>Why not me?</b>

358
00:24:13,776 --> 00:24:15,052
<b>You don't like...</b>

359
00:24:16,717 --> 00:24:17,921
<b>cats.</b>

360
00:24:24,117 --> 00:24:26,831
<b>Yes. I don't like them.</b>

361
00:24:31,927 --> 00:24:33,772
<b>He should be thanking me.</b>

362
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:51,151
<b>A human?</b>

363
00:25:51,377 --> 00:25:52,921
<b>It's not a dream?</b>

364
00:26:02,217 --> 00:26:04,631
<b>If I really turned into a human...</b>

365
00:26:51,496 --> 00:26:52,712
<b>That feels nice.</b>

366
00:27:04,717 --> 00:27:06,562
<b>When did you crawl out?</b>

367
00:27:07,717 --> 00:27:09,492
<b>Don't tell me you already got used to the place.</b>

368
00:27:10,516 --> 00:27:12,062
<b>You'd better not get comfortable.</b>

369
00:27:12,326 --> 00:27:14,302
<b>I'm only going to take care of you...</b>

370
00:27:14,457 --> 00:27:18,371
<b>until I find someone who will adopt you.</b>

371
00:27:19,167 --> 00:27:21,101
<b>So I don't want you to get too comfortable.</b>

372
00:27:26,967 --> 00:27:28,411
<b>Make sure you stay uncomfortable.</b>

373
00:27:37,877 --> 00:27:40,762
<b>Hey, get back on the floor.</b>

374
00:27:45,826 --> 00:27:47,861
<b>My gosh, are you serious?</b>

375
00:27:48,687 --> 00:27:49,901
<b>What's the matter with you?</b>

376
00:27:50,397 --> 00:27:51,472
<b>Hey.</b>

377
00:27:52,326 --> 00:27:53,442
<b>Get off the bed.</b>

378
00:27:55,167 --> 00:27:56,272
<b>Get off the bed.</b>

379
00:27:56,667 --> 00:27:58,712
<b>Will you... Hey! My gosh!</b>

380
00:28:02,637 --> 00:28:05,081
<b>This is why I hate cats.</b>

381
00:28:21,856 --> 00:28:23,931
<b>(Episode 2 will air shortly.)</b>

382
00:28:24,765 --> 00:28:26,265
<b>(Episode 2)</b>

383
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:40,424
<b>Sol Ah, is that you?</b>

384
00:31:16,169 --> 00:31:18,304
<b>Do you know how surprised I was around dawn?</b>

385
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:19,470
<b>That's odd.</b>

386
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:21,744
<b>I showed him to you last night.</b>

387
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:27,284
<b>I'm home.</b>

388
00:31:27,609 --> 00:31:28,955
<b>Hey.</b>

389
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,025
<b>I'm home.</b>

390
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:33,325
<b>Close the door.</b>

391
00:31:38,149 --> 00:31:40,735
<b>You don't even look at me.</b>

392
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,645
<b>My gosh.</b>

393
00:31:56,769 --> 00:32:00,284
<b>We shouldn't let just any beast in the house.</b>

394
00:32:00,709 --> 00:32:03,724
<b>And it's okay to let just any person in?</b>

395
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:08,154
<b>I never said I'd let her in this house.</b>

396
00:32:13,419 --> 00:32:14,419
<b>Who is it?</b>

397
00:32:14,419 --> 00:32:16,560
<b>Hello. We're here to see the place.</b>

398
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,635
<b>What?</b>

399
00:32:17,989 --> 00:32:19,305
<b>Come on up.</b>

400
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:22,705
<b>What...</b>

401
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,974
<b>Are you selling the apartment?</b>

402
00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:28,744
<b>I decided to...</b>

403
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,844
<b>move to the countryside with her.</b>

404
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:34,585
<b>My goodness.</b>

405
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:37,908
<b>How could you make that decision without talking to me?</b>

406
00:32:37,909 --> 00:32:41,594
<b>I thought for a long time before I made the decision.</b>

407
00:32:41,719 --> 00:32:43,120
<b>- So... - So why...</b>

408
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,620
<b>did you think about it yourself when I live here too?</b>

409
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:49,205
<b>What am I to you, Dad?</b>

410
00:32:49,329 --> 00:32:52,135
<b>I really didn't want to say this.</b>

411
00:32:52,829 --> 00:32:55,000
<b>You fell for a gold-digger.</b>

412
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
<b>You don't know how the world works.</b>

413
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,469
<b>You taught poetry writing at a culture center.</b>

414
00:32:59,469 --> 00:33:02,510
<b>Are you trying to lose what little you have to your name?</b>

415
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:04,010
<b>- Kim Sol Ah. - I take back saying...</b>

416
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:06,914
<b>you can do anything you want. Don't get married.</b>

417
00:33:07,079 --> 00:33:09,354
<b>You'll sell the apartment to make a fresh start?</b>

418
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:12,154
<b>I'm sorry, but you can't do it.</b>

419
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:14,495
<b>Because I won't leave this apartment.</b>

420
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:16,864
<b>I got kicked out and ended up with...</b>

421
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,835
<b>someone who's about to get kicked out.</b>

422
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:52,294
<b>You're an adult, not a kid. Smile and give your blessing.</b>

423
00:33:53,719 --> 00:33:57,529
<b>I'm angry with how he's doing it, not what he's doing.</b>

424
00:33:57,529 --> 00:33:59,399
<b>He couldn't bring himself to tell you.</b>

425
00:33:59,399 --> 00:34:00,829
<b>He was considerate so you wouldn't get hurt.</b>

426
00:34:00,829 --> 00:34:03,329
<b>Oh, really? He kept his mouth shut,</b>

427
00:34:03,329 --> 00:34:05,344
<b>then gave me an ultimatum. Is that considerate?</b>

428
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:06,614
<b>Yes.</b>

429
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:10,284
<b>The color of the cafe logo.</b>

430
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:13,054
<b>Change it from hot pink to indian pink.</b>

431
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:15,209
<b>My gosh, Ko Doo Sik.</b>

432
00:34:15,209 --> 00:34:18,625
<b>Someone's so considerate to you as well.</b>

433
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,065
<b>Ji Eun.</b>

434
00:34:25,789 --> 00:34:27,065
<b>Do you dislike me?</b>

435
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:28,519
<b>What?</b>

436
00:34:28,519 --> 00:34:30,804
<b>How much must you dislike me to not want to talk to me?</b>

437
00:34:31,029 --> 00:34:35,174
<b>I thought my breath smelled bad, so I had my teeth scaled last week.</b>

438
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:37,130
<b>I gargled with mouthwash for hours.</b>

439
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:39,015
<b>- Hey. - Leave me alone.</b>

440
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,645
<b>I had a lot of messages to relay.</b>

441
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,414
<b>In case I got mixed up...</b>

442
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:46,214
<b>What's wrong with hot pink?</b>

443
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:48,685
<b>Is it because you know I like hot pink?</b>

444
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:50,380
<b>It is, isn't it?</b>

445
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:53,420
<b>You dislike hot pink because you dislike me, don't you?</b>

446
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:55,125
<b>No, it's...</b>

447
00:34:55,279 --> 00:34:58,025
<b>I asked her to change it. Why? Is there a problem?</b>

448
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:00,594
<b>Then shall we change it?</b>

449
00:35:12,099 --> 00:35:13,315
<b>Indian pink?</b>

450
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,769
<b>I really don't understand why people like...</b>

451
00:35:15,769 --> 00:35:17,145
<b>this whitish color.</b>

452
00:35:17,469 --> 00:35:18,745
<b>Look at this hot pink color.</b>

453
00:35:18,839 --> 00:35:20,880
<b>It's nice and dark, and everyone likes it.</b>

454
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,579
<b>There's no reason to think about it. It's a given.</b>

455
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:23,849
<b>Flirting? No need.</b>

456
00:35:23,849 --> 00:35:25,310
<b>Playing hard to get? No way.</b>

457
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:26,724
<b>I like you for sure!</b>

458
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:33,094
<b>This color is talking to me.</b>

459
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,435
<b>"Do you like me?"</b>

460
00:35:37,229 --> 00:35:38,335
<b>"Do you like me?"</b>

461
00:35:39,959 --> 00:35:41,104
<b>"Do you like me?"</b>

462
00:35:42,399 --> 00:35:43,544
<b>I do.</b>

463
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:20,775
<b>Who wants to raise a cat?</b>

464
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:25,885
<b>My son is only three months old now.</b>

465
00:36:26,539 --> 00:36:28,484
<b>Cats shed too much fur.</b>

466
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:32,025
<b>Kittens are cute, but I'm not fond of grown-up cats.</b>

467
00:36:32,519 --> 00:36:34,354
<b>Why don't you just raise it?</b>

468
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:35,849
<b>I don't like cats.</b>

469
00:36:35,849 --> 00:36:37,325
<b>Why do you not like them?</b>

470
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:42,034
<b>Well, they don't come to me when I call them like dogs...</b>

471
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:43,430
<b>and just do as they please.</b>

472
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:46,534
<b>Still, isn't it cute when they come near you sneakily?</b>

473
00:36:48,029 --> 00:36:50,029
<b>They purr lovingly next to you at one point...</b>

474
00:36:50,029 --> 00:36:52,715
<b>but suddenly disappear as if nothing happened.</b>

475
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:54,375
<b>I really can't trust them.</b>

476
00:36:56,609 --> 00:36:59,454
<b>There are many stray cats, but there aren't many stray dogs.</b>

477
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:00,715
<b>Why do you think that is?</b>

478
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:16,560
<b>They're too wary...</b>

479
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,589
<b>and spying on people secretly annoys me too.</b>

480
00:37:18,589 --> 00:37:21,135
<b>- That's because they're cautious. - No, they're too suspicious.</b>

481
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:46,619
<b>They consider people as servants who do their chores.</b>

482
00:37:46,619 --> 00:37:49,204
<b>No, was it a can opener that opens their food for them?</b>

483
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:04,885
<b>I've heard of dogs saving people,</b>

484
00:38:05,009 --> 00:38:09,084
<b>but cats can never become animals that protect someone.</b>

485
00:38:12,109 --> 00:38:14,450
<b>They're merely selfish traitors that only think of survival...</b>

486
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:16,064
<b>at a critical moment.</b>

487
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:55,194
<b>Wait, sir. Isn't this the man who lives in unit 605?</b>

488
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,965
<b>What happened? Did you call an ambulance?</b>

489
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,684
<b>- Who is the guardian? - Oh, here...</b>

490
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:15,115
<b>- He was here just now. - We'll have to go for now.</b>

491
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:19,084
<b>(119 Emergency Services)</b>

492
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:37,074
<b>You know so much about cats.</b>

493
00:39:37,329 --> 00:39:38,775
<b>Doesn't that mean you like them?</b>

494
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,875
<b>- Let's go. - Hello?</b>

495
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:45,515
<b>The hospital?</b>

496
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:57,865
<b>- Where is Mr. Kim Soo Pyung? - Over there.</b>

497
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:22,755
<b>What happened? I heard you fainted.</b>

498
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:25,284
<b>What about work?</b>

499
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:29,125
<b>- You didn't have to come. - Who else would...</b>

500
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,034
<b>Sol Ah.</b>

501
00:41:11,459 --> 00:41:13,775
<b>What an unexpected coincidence.</b>

502
00:41:14,499 --> 00:41:15,674
<b>It's so poetic.</b>

503
00:41:16,729 --> 00:41:17,845
<b>It's nice to see you.</b>

504
00:41:18,530 --> 00:41:19,645
<b>I met your dad...</b>

505
00:41:19,999 --> 00:41:22,145
<b>at the culture center while learning poetry.</b>

506
00:41:27,609 --> 00:41:29,084
<b>My name is Bang Sil.</b>

507
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:33,755
<b>"I am a thread. and you are a needle."</b>

508
00:41:34,249 --> 00:41:37,265
<b>"I shall enter your narrow door."</b>

509
00:41:39,089 --> 00:41:40,759
<b>It's my favorite poem I wrote.</b>

510
00:41:40,759 --> 00:41:43,404
<b>Your dad criticized it harshly...</b>

511
00:41:43,589 --> 00:41:45,505
<b>but he eventually became my needle.</b>

512
00:41:46,099 --> 00:41:48,074
<b>- Right, Mr. Kim? - Yes.</b>

513
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:54,140
<b>Patient Kim Soo Pyung?</b>

514
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:55,170
<b>- Yes. - Yes.</b>

515
00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:56,544
<b>I have your test results.</b>

516
00:41:56,869 --> 00:41:59,284
<b>Is it because of arrhythmia? Bradyarrhythmia?</b>

517
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:01,109
<b>Oh, yes. You're right.</b>

518
00:42:01,109 --> 00:42:04,310
<b>It's dangerous if it's bad enough to make him faint,</b>

519
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:05,379
<b>so...</b>

520
00:42:05,379 --> 00:42:08,725
<b>You want to recommend using a cardiac pacemaker?</b>

521
00:42:09,249 --> 00:42:12,225
<b>But he doesn't want to attach a machine on his chest.</b>

522
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:15,334
<b>I told you. You should listen to me.</b>

523
00:42:16,359 --> 00:42:18,989
<b>You should be admitted for some more tests...</b>

524
00:42:18,989 --> 00:42:20,530
<b>and get ready for the procedure tomorrow.</b>

525
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:22,804
<b>- Okay. - Wait. What is going on?</b>

526
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,944
<b>Why is my dad's heart...</b>

527
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:26,745
<b>Attach what on his chest?</b>

528
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:30,015
<b>Don't worry, Sol Ah. It's a very simple procedure.</b>

529
00:42:30,209 --> 00:42:31,745
<b>- Right, sir? - Yes.</b>

530
00:42:32,369 --> 00:42:33,485
<b>Well, then.</b>

531
00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:39,025
<b>I told you, Mr. Kim. You heard him, right?</b>

532
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:41,154
<b>Right?</b>

533
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:47,064
<b>But who brought me to the hospital?</b>

534
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:50,735
<b>I heard the security guard called the ambulance.</b>

535
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:56,245
<b>I have no memory of coming outside the house.</b>

536
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:01,475
<b>When did I come out?</b>

537
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:05,245
<b>I only remember a cat.</b>

538
00:43:08,009 --> 00:43:09,115
<b>Goodness.</b>

539
00:43:33,116 --> 00:43:38,116


540
00:44:02,530 --> 00:44:03,674
<b>What...</b>

541
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:11,574
<b>Are you all right?</b>

542
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:13,044
<b>Shall we meet up?</b>

543
00:45:13,239 --> 00:45:14,674
<b>I'm fine.</b>

544
00:45:18,839 --> 00:45:20,314
<b>Can you manage being alone?</b>

545
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:22,109
<b>Shall I send Jae Seon over?</b>

546
00:45:22,109 --> 00:45:26,124
<b>(Shall I send Jae Seon over?)</b>

547
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:28,094
<b>Don't you dare.</b>

548
00:46:57,670 --> 00:46:58,945
<b>Lee Jae Seon?</b>

549
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,784
<b>Don't look at my face. It's a mess.</b>

550
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:07,394
<b>I'm okay. Dad will be fine too.</b>

551
00:47:08,749 --> 00:47:10,995
<b>Tonight, his girlfriend will stay with...</b>

552
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:14,834
<b>I mean, my dad's fiancee.</b>

553
00:47:15,059 --> 00:47:17,465
<b>They're moving to the countryside for my dad's health.</b>

554
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:20,905
<b>She's called Bang Sil.</b>

555
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,245
<b>She's so smiley.</b>

556
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:27,814
<b>Dad looked like he'd lost a few screws and grinned too.</b>

557
00:47:31,039 --> 00:47:32,784
<b>Why am I telling you this?</b>

558
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:36,624
<b>Anyway, I'm okay.</b>

559
00:47:37,809 --> 00:47:39,054
<b>You can go.</b>

560
00:47:44,390 --> 00:47:46,324
<b>You're just like him. You're a cat.</b>

561
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:52,665
<b>Cats all disappear whenever they want to.</b>

562
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:55,034
<b>Without a word.</b>

563
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:59,275
<b>I mean, they think they're being considerate.</b>

564
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:02,039
<b>In case I'll worry that he's sick?</b>

565
00:48:02,039 --> 00:48:03,415
<b>That I'll say he's a burden?</b>

566
00:48:04,739 --> 00:48:06,485
<b>If I'd never found out,</b>

567
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:08,655
<b>I'd have gotten kicked out without knowing anything.</b>

568
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:13,725
<b>I'd have gotten angry with Dad and yelled at him.</b>

569
00:48:15,819 --> 00:48:17,195
<b>When he's sick.</b>

570
00:48:21,459 --> 00:48:25,005
<b>His heart beats slower than average and I didn't know.</b>

571
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:31,675
<b>I'm so darn grateful that he's considerate.</b>

572
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:37,344
<b>This is why I dislike cats.</b>

573
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:39,809
<b>You disappeared when you wanted to,</b>

574
00:48:39,809 --> 00:48:42,185
<b>and now you're back trying to comfort me.</b>

575
00:48:44,309 --> 00:48:45,955
<b>It's fine, so get lost.</b>

576
00:48:50,749 --> 00:48:52,094
<b>Go.</b>

577
00:48:58,430 --> 00:49:00,005
<b>I told you to go.</b>

578
00:49:03,269 --> 00:49:05,144
<b>He really came back.</b>

579
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:08,515
<b>My Beodeul Love.</b>

580
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:37,205
<b>You won't go when I tell you to.</b>

581
00:49:39,469 --> 00:49:41,715
<b>You never came to me when I waited for you.</b>

582
00:49:49,110 --> 00:49:50,485
<b>Did you have...</b>

583
00:49:52,650 --> 00:49:55,894
<b>a reason you couldn't share as my dad has?</b>

584
00:50:00,459 --> 00:50:03,094
<b>Darn. I'm talking to myself again.</b>

585
00:50:06,430 --> 00:50:08,134
<b>Say something.</b>

586
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:20,015
<b>(Jae Seon)</b>

587
00:50:20,239 --> 00:50:21,354
<b>Lee Jae Seon?</b>

588
00:50:39,959 --> 00:50:43,104
<b>Hey, Jae Seon. Where are you?</b>

589
00:50:44,569 --> 00:50:46,304
<b>Why are you there?</b>

590
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,245
<b>Just a while ago, you were...</b>

591
00:50:52,739 --> 00:50:54,384
<b>right here.</b>

592
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,410
<b>I was in my workshop all day.</b>

593
00:50:56,410 --> 00:50:58,185
<b>Then you didn't hear anything I said...</b>

594
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:02,725
<b>Who was I talking to?</b>

595
00:51:07,319 --> 00:51:09,390
<b>Kim Sol Ah. Are you there?</b>

596
00:51:09,390 --> 00:51:11,390
<b>Yes. I'm here.</b>

597
00:51:11,390 --> 00:51:12,534
<b>Where's Sergei?</b>

598
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:14,930
<b>Next to me.</b>

599
00:51:14,930 --> 00:51:16,435
<b>Are you sure he's okay?</b>

600
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,405
<b>He's right here, but...</b>

601
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:22,945
<b>Why is he here?</b>

602
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:28,784
<b>This won't work.</b>

603
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:31,525
<b>You can't keep Sergei.</b>

604
00:51:31,549 --> 00:51:34,725
<b>Gosh. You do feel bad then?</b>

605
00:51:35,219 --> 00:51:36,455
<b>You should be.</b>

606
00:51:36,650 --> 00:51:40,465
<b>You should feel bad that I'm caring for that woman's cat.</b>

607
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:42,165
<b>That's not the reason.</b>

608
00:51:42,590 --> 00:51:44,564
<b>I'm uncomfortable leaving him with you.</b>

609
00:51:44,590 --> 00:51:46,034
<b>What do you mean?</b>

610
00:51:47,330 --> 00:51:50,969
<b>Are you more worried about her cat than me?</b>

611
00:51:50,969 --> 00:51:52,705
<b>Is your door locked at all times?</b>

612
00:51:53,370 --> 00:51:55,814
<b>Cats can disappear in a split second.</b>

613
00:51:56,140 --> 00:51:58,784
<b>- Well... - You might never find him again.</b>

614
00:52:00,209 --> 00:52:04,185
<b>If you're that concerned, find someone to adopt him.</b>

615
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:07,054
<b>I am looking, and I'll find someone as soon as possible.</b>

616
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:09,794
<b>Don't abandon him this time.</b>

617
00:52:11,350 --> 00:52:12,390
<b>I beg of you.</b>

618
00:52:12,390 --> 00:52:13,665
<b>What?</b>

619
00:52:17,759 --> 00:52:19,405
<b>What did he mean?</b>

620
00:52:20,130 --> 00:52:21,775
<b>Who will abandon him?</b>

621
00:52:24,069 --> 00:52:26,975
<b>I should be the one to say that.</b>

622
00:52:56,870 --> 00:52:58,074
<b>Hey, cat.</b>

623
00:52:59,029 --> 00:53:01,074
<b>Did you see the person next to me?</b>

624
00:53:05,410 --> 00:53:07,215
<b>How are you out here?</b>

625
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:13,124
<b>Can you not talk? Answer me.</b>

626
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:18,064
<b>Why won't you make a sound?</b>

627
00:53:19,289 --> 00:53:21,294
<b>Will you make a sound if I press you here?</b>

628
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:25,735
<b>Beep.</b>

629
00:53:27,499 --> 00:53:30,905
<b>Kid. What are you doing here?</b>

630
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:34,445
<b>Where's your mom? Are you lost?</b>

631
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:37,614
<b>You must feel so cold.</b>

632
00:53:38,670 --> 00:53:39,784
<b>Here.</b>

633
00:53:45,049 --> 00:53:47,525
<b>There. Do you feel better?</b>

634
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:52,064
<b>What's your name? How old are you?</b>

635
00:53:53,759 --> 00:53:55,864
<b>Why won't you make a sound?</b>

636
00:53:57,860 --> 00:53:59,765
<b>Will I hear something if I press the button?</b>

637
00:54:04,670 --> 00:54:05,745
<b>Beep.</b>

638
00:54:12,539 --> 00:54:13,680
<b>Hello.</b>

639
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:16,015
<b>- Thank you. - You're welcome.</b>

640
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:17,749
<b>I'll find your mom. Come with me.</b>

641
00:54:17,749 --> 00:54:20,354
<b>It's cold, so let's go to my place first.</b>

642
00:54:25,249 --> 00:54:26,995
<b>Wait here for a moment.</b>

643
00:54:34,830 --> 00:54:36,304
<b>Yes, hello?</b>

644
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:56,995
<b>Kid.</b>

645
00:55:02,719 --> 00:55:04,005
<b>Kid.</b>

646
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:06,334
<b>Kid.</b>

647
00:55:37,130 --> 00:55:40,104
<b>Hey. I told you not to get too comfortable.</b>

648
00:55:44,229 --> 00:55:46,304
<b>We can't stay here anymore.</b>

649
00:55:47,299 --> 00:55:48,475
<b>We must leave.</b>

650
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:55,955
<b>But still,</b>

651
00:55:57,249 --> 00:55:59,354
<b>I don't feel lonely now that I'm getting kicked out with you.</b>

652
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:20,074
<b>You're doing this again.</b>

653
00:56:23,170 --> 00:56:25,044
<b>Sleep down there.</b>

654
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:34,695
<b>Will you stop coming up here?</b>

655
00:56:43,529 --> 00:56:44,735
<b>It's her.</b>

656
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:51,205
<b>She makes me turn human.</b>

657
00:57:47,959 --> 00:57:51,134
<b>(Meow, the Secret Boy)</b>

658
00:57:52,890 --> 00:57:54,235
<b>He'll get the wrong idea.</b>

659
00:57:54,999 --> 00:57:56,275
<b>It must be so tough.</b>

660
00:57:56,299 --> 00:57:58,975
<b>You're actually surprisingly clingy.</b>

661
00:57:59,569 --> 00:58:01,544
<b>Will you at least see me off?</b>

662
00:58:05,569 --> 00:58:06,685
<b>Hong Jo.</b>

663
00:58:10,650 --> 00:58:12,384
<b>Did I leave the ladder there?</b>

664
00:58:12,709 --> 00:58:14,054
<b>I'll be right down.</b>

665
00:58:18,390 --> 00:58:19,495
<b>Oh, no!</b>
