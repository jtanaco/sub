<b>Let's get divorced.</b>

2
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:09,980
<b>What?</b>

3
00:00:13,509 --> 00:00:14,720
<b>Let's get a divorce.</b>

4
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:19,050
<b>But under one condition.</b>

5
00:00:22,219 --> 00:00:24,296
<b>As you know,
my mom is still traumatized...</b>

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,289
<b>over Da Hee's annulled marriage.</b>

7
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:32,269
<b>She said that I'm her only hope
and that I should make mine work.</b>

8
00:00:32,769 --> 00:00:34,670
<b>The timing is rotten,</b>

9
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,909
<b>so let's not tell our parents
for a while.</b>

10
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:40,640
<b>We will...</b>

11
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,210
<b>once the time seems right.</b>

12
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,985
<b>I asked around
and selling the house...</b>

13
00:00:46,009 --> 00:00:48,320
<b>will each give us enough
to rent a studio apartment.</b>

14
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:52,896
<b>So until then,
let's not tell our families...</b>

15
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,549
<b>Hold on a second.</b>

16
00:00:57,259 --> 00:00:58,729
<b>What are you doing?</b>

17
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,890
<b>Are you truly asking for a divorce?</b>

18
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:03,530
<b>You want to sever our marriage?</b>

19
00:01:03,859 --> 00:01:05,775
<b>We're only going back
to how things were.</b>

20
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:07,299
<b>That's not what I mean...</b>

21
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:15,270
<b>Is this because you're upset
about what I said the other day?</b>

22
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:18,486
<b>If that's the case,
I'll admit that I was wrong, but...</b>

23
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:19,709
<b>Gyu Jin.</b>

24
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:23,920
<b>It wasn't a mistake.</b>

25
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,665
<b>You were just finally
speaking the truth.</b>

26
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:29,736
<b>Of course not. Don't be ridiculous.</b>

27
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,260
<b>Don't deny it.</b>

28
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:34,629
<b>We drifted apart...</b>

29
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,299
<b>and became
no better than strangers...</b>

30
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:39,469
<b>since that day.</b>

31
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:42,239
<b>I felt guilty...</b>

32
00:01:42,739 --> 00:01:44,540
<b>and you resented me.</b>

33
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:49,510
<b>But we kept those feelings
bottled up inside...</b>

34
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,810
<b>and found other ways
to be at each other's throats.</b>

35
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,219
<b>I thought you'd
forever be on my side...</b>

36
00:01:58,349 --> 00:02:00,150
<b>and a place for me to rest,</b>

37
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,730
<b>but that has changed.</b>

38
00:02:05,989 --> 00:02:07,060
<b>When...</b>

39
00:02:08,329 --> 00:02:11,370
<b>was the last time
we enjoyed each other's company?</b>

40
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,300
<b>A year ago? Two years ago?</b>

41
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,645
<b>Na Hee...</b>

42
00:02:17,669 --> 00:02:18,840
<b>That's not all.</b>

43
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,240
<b>Your mother is egotistical...</b>

44
00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:23,939
<b>and you put on a show
as Son of the Year.</b>

45
00:02:24,139 --> 00:02:26,050
<b>I'm sick and tired...</b>

46
00:02:26,949 --> 00:02:28,695
<b>of putting up an act too.</b>

47
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:29,949
<b>She's egotistical?</b>

48
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,735
<b>Watch what you're saying
or you'll regret it later.</b>

49
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:37,560
<b>I can't take it anymore.
Your mother...</b>

50
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,229
<b>is too much.</b>

51
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,000
<b>Hey.</b>

52
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:45,945
<b>Why do you keep acting
like the victim here?</b>

53
00:02:45,969 --> 00:02:48,216
<b>Living with you
hasn't been merry for me too.</b>

54
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,045
<b>You're just as odd
as my mom, you know.</b>

55
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:51,786
<b>You think you're the law,</b>

56
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,615
<b>you don't consider others' feelings,</b>

57
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:55,599
<b>and you grill people
when you think they're wrong.</b>

58
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:59,556
<b>It's like I've been living
with a bomb on my waist.</b>

59
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,680
<b>That's why I'm saying
we should get a divorce.</b>

60
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,256
<b>I know I can be weird.</b>

61
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,596
<b>It's why we're both miserable
in our own ways.</b>

62
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,990
<b>So why must we stay together?
Whom does that benefit?</b>

63
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,936
<b>Fine, let's end it.</b>

64
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,729
<b>We'll get a divorce. Happy now?</b>

65
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,669
<b>Don't say that out of spite.</b>

66
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:23,115
<b>Can't you see that I'm dead serious?</b>

67
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:24,746
<b>I'm just as serious too,</b>

68
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:26,539
<b>so let's get a divorce.</b>

69
00:03:45,389 --> 00:03:47,430
<b>Living with you
hasn't been merry for me too.</b>

70
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,759
<b>It's like I've been living
with a bomb on my waist.</b>

71
00:04:05,949 --> 00:04:07,009
<b>A divorce?</b>

72
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,580
<b>Is it that easy for you?</b>

73
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,550
<b>How can she...</b>

74
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:19,090
<b>How can you make
a mistake like that?</b>

75
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:22,175
<b>What have I constantly
been reminding you to check?</b>

76
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:25,029
<b>Typos, dates, and passport numbers.</b>

77
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,399
<b>You should never mess those up.</b>

78
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:29,776
<b>What have you learned
over the past year?</b>

79
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,375
<b>What if you found out
on the day of departure?</b>

80
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:32,915
<b>The next flight
was fully booked too.</b>

81
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,716
<b>I double-checked,</b>

82
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,509
<b>but I had so much work that week...</b>

83
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:38,509
<b>I'm sorry, sir.</b>

84
00:04:38,649 --> 00:04:40,656
<b>She was only helping me out,
so it's my fault.</b>

85
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,680
<b>Of course, you should be sorry.</b>

86
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,920
<b>You insisted on getting married...</b>

87
00:04:44,949 --> 00:04:47,790
<b>during our busiest season
of the year...</b>

88
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,160
<b>only to get an annulment?</b>

89
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:52,389
<b>What a joke.</b>

90
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:55,399
<b>This is where lack of education
truly shows.</b>

91
00:04:55,699 --> 00:04:57,276
<b>It's too obvious.</b>

92
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,776
<b>Have Ji Hye and Tae Hoon
ever made a mistake like this?</b>

93
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,375
<b>It's why they were promoted
to full-time employees...</b>

94
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:04,170
<b>even though you were hired first.</b>

95
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,040
<b>If I could, I'd love
nothing more than to...</b>

96
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:10,379
<b>fire you both.</b>

97
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:15,579
<b>But the boss wants to promote
one of you to full-time status.</b>

100
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:23,136
<b>We'll decide after
seeing your presentations.</b>

101
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,906
<b>- What?
- A full-time employee?</b>

102
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:27,230
<b>The spot will only go to one of you.</b>

103
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:31,300
<b>This is your last chance
so do your best. Got it?</b>

104
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:32,500
<b>Out of the way.</b>

105
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,925
<b>It's great that we weren't
reprimanded in any way.</b>

<b>Right, I guess.</b>

<b>It's all right. I have it too.</b>

110
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:01,529
<b>I see.</b>

111
00:06:07,629 --> 00:06:08,670

<b>Isn't it obvious?</b>

00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:20,149
<b>What other documents

115

<b>We have until 6 p.m.</b>

<b>I'd rather you not take too long.</b>

119

<b>Didn't Gyu Jin tell you?</b>

169

<b>Don't you two talk?</b>

172
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,846
<b>You said it was a secret.</b>

173
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,716
<b>Only to Mom.</b>

<b>Your mom knows everything

181

<b>Don't be relieved

201

202
00:10:21,649 --> 00:10:23,590

00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:38,509
<b>I just had no choice.</b>

463
00:24:39,579 --> 00:24:40,710
<b>No.</b>

464
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,519
<b>You always have a choice, Song Yi.</b>

465
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:45,619
<b>This is your choice.</b>

466
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:49,190
<b>It's your choice
that you want to survive this way.</b>

467
00:24:49,589 --> 00:24:52,160
<b>And it is my choice
that I'm quitting like this.</b>

468
00:24:53,089 --> 00:24:55,230
<b>I ended up getting fired,</b>

469
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:57,900
<b>but I'm not ashamed of myself.</b>

470
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:00,400
<b>What about you?</b>

471
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:11,255
<b>- Goodbye.
- Bye.</b>

472
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,250
<b>Thank you, Doctor.</b>

473
00:25:18,849 --> 00:25:21,065
<b>- Yes.
- That was the last patient.</b>

474
00:25:21,089 --> 00:25:22,220
<b>Already?</b>

475
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:26,606
<b>Why does work finish
on time these days?</b>

476
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:29,235
<b>Why do we not
have many patients here?</b>

477
00:25:29,259 --> 00:25:31,960
<b>I always said we should promote
our hospital better.</b>

478
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,755
<b>You're finished, aren't you?</b>

479
00:25:42,779 --> 00:25:44,109
<b>What? Jeong Hun?</b>

480
00:25:44,339 --> 00:25:46,109
<b>How serious is it?</b>

481
00:25:46,349 --> 00:25:48,156
<b>Okay. I'll be right there.</b>

482
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,849
<b>Okay. Wait for me.</b>

483
00:25:50,779 --> 00:25:54,325
<b>Oh, hi. My friend just got injured
in a three-way collision.</b>

484
00:25:54,349 --> 00:25:55,795
<b>Gosh, this is serious.</b>

485
00:25:55,819 --> 00:25:57,789
<b>I'm sorry,
but I can't make it today.</b>

486
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,636
<b>I will talk to you later.</b>

487
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:02,529
<b>I'm sorry. I have no choice.
Gosh, I'm sorry.</b>

488
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,856
<b>Where do I go now?</b>

489
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,095
<b>(Yongju Traditional Market
Merchant Association)</b>

490
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:27,966
<b>And one more thing.</b>

491
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:31,835
<b>Since the spring event,
we all have...</b>

492
00:26:31,859 --> 00:26:34,529
<b>worked really hard together.</b>

493
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:36,759
<b>Like I always say...</b>

494
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,535
<b>Where did you get your hair dyed?</b>

495
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,005
<b>It looks good.</b>

496
00:26:40,029 --> 00:26:41,745
<b>At the shop behind the drug store.
It's only 15 dollars.</b>

497
00:26:41,769 --> 00:26:44,170
<b>Really? That's great.</b>

498
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,640
<b>Just pretend to listen to him.
It won't end otherwise.</b>

499
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:54,525
<b>Anyway, on the agenda
at the previous meeting...</b>

500
00:26:54,549 --> 00:26:57,795
<b>was a program for
our members' health and welfare.</b>

501
00:26:57,819 --> 00:26:59,295
<b>Research showed that...</b>

502
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:02,325
<b>most of you were interested in
learning dance sports.</b>

503
00:27:02,349 --> 00:27:05,035
<b>Starting next week,
we'll hire an instructor...</b>

504
00:27:05,059 --> 00:27:07,636
<b>to teach us in
the afternoon or evening.</b>

505
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:10,200
<b>I'd like you all to
attend if possible.</b>

506
00:27:12,869 --> 00:27:15,206
<b>Listen. Just to
give us a demonstration,</b>

507
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:18,245
<b>the instructor agreed to
come by today.</b>

508
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:22,315
<b>Anyone who wishes to take part
can come to the lounge.</b>

509
00:27:22,339 --> 00:27:25,315
<b>Especially you men.
Make sure to be there.</b>

510
00:27:25,339 --> 00:27:26,349
<b>Okay.</b>

511
00:27:26,579 --> 00:27:29,750
<b>Will the president
and his wife be present?</b>

512
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:32,126
<b>No, not me.</b>

513
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,595
<b>We're both terrible at
anything physical.</b>

514
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:37,835
<b>The president and wife
should be a good example.</b>

515
00:27:37,859 --> 00:27:39,636
<b>You want people to attend.</b>

516
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:42,466
<b>Exactly. The president
should be there...</b>

517
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:44,436
<b>so other men can join. Am I wrong?</b>

518
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:45,437
<b>- No.
- No.</b>

519
00:27:45,461 --> 00:27:48,206
<b>Well, that is true, but I'm not...</b>

520
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:51,670
<b>- He said yes!
- Applause!</b>

521
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:56,609
<b>Sirs and madams,
it's lovely to meet you.</b>

522
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:01,525
<b>Let's see how supple you are...</b>

523
00:28:01,549 --> 00:28:04,220
<b>by learning the basic step.</b>

524
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:05,519
<b>Look at us.</b>

525
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:12,190
<b>In 7, 8.
1, 2, cha, cha, 1.</b>

526
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:15,335
<b>2, 3, cha, cha, 1.</b>

527
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:19,029
<b>Keep going. 2, 3, cha, cha, 1.</b>

528
00:28:19,869 --> 00:28:22,345
<b>Wow. This mother here is so good.</b>

529
00:28:22,369 --> 00:28:23,640
<b>You're our ace.</b>

530
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:26,670
<b>Hey, I'm not a mother. I'm a miss.</b>

531
00:28:27,109 --> 00:28:29,815
<b>Oh, I see. I apologize.</b>

532
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:32,555
<b>She's just saying what she thought.</b>

533
00:28:32,579 --> 00:28:35,025
<b>It's your fault
for not looking single.</b>

534
00:28:35,049 --> 00:28:36,279
<b>Stop it.</b>

535
00:28:37,579 --> 00:28:39,420
<b>Miss, is this right?</b>

536
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:41,325
<b>Is this how to dance?</b>

537
00:28:41,349 --> 00:28:43,696
<b>Is this it? It is, isn't it?</b>

538
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,765
<b>Yes. Not bad.</b>

539
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:46,366
<b>Ma'am, shall I help you?</b>

540
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:48,166
<b>No, I'm fine. I can manage.</b>

541
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:49,676
<b>Go on. Get his help.</b>

542
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,805
<b>- Why me?
- Why not?</b>

543
00:28:51,829 --> 00:28:53,106
<b>Go on.</b>

544
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:55,069
<b>Don't be silly.</b>

545
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:56,569
<b>- Cheers!
- Cheers.</b>

546
00:29:00,109 --> 00:29:01,210
<b>I love it.</b>

547
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:04,315
<b>Korean beer is just my taste.</b>

548
00:29:04,339 --> 00:29:05,785
<b>- It's so good.
- Is it?</b>

549
00:29:05,809 --> 00:29:08,825
<b>You said you'd live in Istanbul
and play golf and gaze at the sea.</b>

550
00:29:08,849 --> 00:29:11,896
<b>Hey. Great views
only last you for a while.</b>

551
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,589
<b>I looked at so much green
that my eyesight improved.</b>

552
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:16,495
<b>I was hoping to visit
while you were there.</b>

553
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:19,565
<b>You should've stayed a while longer.
Why did you come back?</b>

554
00:29:19,589 --> 00:29:22,835
<b>Didn't I tell you to visit soon?
Pil Jae got to visit, didn't he?</b>

555
00:29:22,859 --> 00:29:24,376
<b>Attention. One o'clock.</b>

556
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:27,700
<b>Why? What? How pretty is she?</b>

557
00:29:29,069 --> 00:29:30,539
<b>I'm looking right now.</b>

558
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:46,890
<b>You don't have a decent job
and you aren't that pretty.</b>

559
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:48,726
<b>Your family isn't that great either.</b>

560
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:51,890
<b>We're done.
Our marriage is void, okay?</b>

561
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:01,106
<b>She looks like something
definitely happened to her.</b>

562
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:03,200
<b>What do you think that is?
Was she dumped?</b>

563
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:05,039
<b>Was she conned?</b>

564
00:30:05,269 --> 00:30:08,245
<b>Did she lose the deposit
to her lease to a pyramid scheme?</b>

565
00:30:08,269 --> 00:30:10,039
<b>No. You're all wrong.</b>

566
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:12,515
<b>On the day of their wedding,</b>

567
00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:14,825
<b>she witnessed
her fiance cheating on her.</b>

568
00:30:14,849 --> 00:30:18,680
<b>And the guy had the gall
to void the wedding, I think?</b>

569
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,019
<b>Perhaps?</b>

570
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:21,619
<b>That's detailed.</b>

571
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,835
<b>Have you been watching
Korean dramas in Turkey?</b>

572
00:30:23,859 --> 00:30:25,235
<b>Not in Turkey.</b>

573
00:30:25,259 --> 00:30:28,166
<b>The day I returned,
I saw something killer.</b>

574
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:29,559
<b>- What?
- What did you see?</b>

575
00:30:35,069 --> 00:30:36,329
<b>Hey, wait here.</b>

576
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:43,380
<b>I drank a whole pitcher
and I'm even not drunk.</b>

577
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:48,609
<b>Nothing in the world
goes how I want it to.</b>

578
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:50,019
<b>My gosh.</b>

579
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:52,349
<b>Hey. Excuse me.</b>

580
00:30:53,089 --> 00:30:54,250
<b>Is this yours?</b>

581
00:30:56,660 --> 00:31:00,166
<b>Thank you. I appreciate it. Thanks.</b>

582
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:02,366
<b>You're welcome. Get home safely.</b>

583
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:03,960
<b>You seem drunk.</b>

584
00:31:04,059 --> 00:31:05,059
<b>What?</b>

585
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:10,815
<b>I'm not. I'm not drunk at all.</b>

586
00:31:10,839 --> 00:31:13,769
<b>You're wrong. You look very drunk.</b>

587
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:15,839
<b>Never mind, then.</b>

588
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:17,910
<b>Wait!</b>

589
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:23,079
<b>You brought me my belongings,</b>

590
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:26,079
<b>and I'm eternally grateful.</b>

591
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:29,049
<b>Would you like to get
just one drink with me?</b>

592
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:33,359
<b>I really want to get drunk.
I really, really do.</b>

593
00:31:34,529 --> 00:31:35,506
<b>Yes?</b>

594
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:37,505
<b>What kind of drunk antic is this?</b>

595
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:38,559
<b>Yes?</b>

596
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:44,216
<b>Slowly. Slow down.</b>

597
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,285
<b>Don't you worry. I'm not drunk.</b>

598
00:31:47,309 --> 00:31:51,880
<b>The more I drink,
the more sober I feel.</b>

599
00:31:52,309 --> 00:31:53,349
<b>Hey.</b>

600
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:56,795
<b>Why do you think
I asked you to drink with me?</b>

601
00:31:56,819 --> 00:31:58,180
<b>I don't know.</b>

602
00:32:00,089 --> 00:32:01,250
<b>Because I'm handsome?</b>

603
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:06,095
<b>You're really funny, mister.</b>

604
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:07,460
<b>What, "mister"?</b>

605
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:09,406
<b>It's clear that
we're only 4 or 5 years apart.</b>

606
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:12,259
<b>I asked you to drink with me...</b>

607
00:32:14,269 --> 00:32:16,170
<b>because I don't know you.</b>

608
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,500
<b>What?</b>

609
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:21,440
<b>I feel so frustrated.</b>

610
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:25,640
<b>If I were to just go home like this,</b>

611
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:30,220
<b>I think I'd grab my parents
and wail my heart out.</b>

612
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,220
<b>I want to get things off my chest,</b>

613
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:39,359
<b>but I can't talk to a friend
or someone I know.</b>

614
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:42,966
<b>I don't want them to
see me at my lowest,</b>

615
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:44,960
<b>and it hurts my pride.</b>

616
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,700
<b>Hey.</b>

617
00:32:47,369 --> 00:32:51,299
<b>I have no idea
what you're going through,</b>

618
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,809
<b>but you can't get
over a man like this.</b>

619
00:32:54,369 --> 00:32:56,410
<b>He wasn't even worth this...</b>

620
00:32:58,839 --> 00:33:00,250
<b>I don't think.</b>

621
00:33:00,609 --> 00:33:02,426
<b>Pretend you stepped on a turd.</b>

622
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:04,696
<b>It happens to all of us
once in our lifetime.</b>

623
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,220
<b>It was just a bad day.</b>

624
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:09,126
<b>- Yes, we step in turds.
- Right.</b>

625
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:13,706
<b>When it gets in a tiny crease
in the sole, that's darn annoying.</b>

626
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:15,059
<b>You know the feeling.</b>

627
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,230
<b>The truth is,</b>

628
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:26,569
<b>my marriage was voided
on the day of the wedding.</b>

629
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:30,940
<b>I won't say why
because that's privacy.</b>

630
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:35,980
<b>But then today, I even lost my job.</b>

631
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:39,779
<b>Don't you think that
life is just crazy?</b>

632
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:43,390
<b>Here.</b>

633
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:47,160
<b>My nickname is Last One.</b>

634
00:33:48,329 --> 00:33:51,160
<b>It's only because
I'm the youngest child,</b>

635
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,876
<b>but is that why?</b>

636
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:55,869
<b>I've been the last at everything
my whole life.</b>

637
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:59,916
<b>The oldest, my brother,
is great at sports.</b>

638
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:02,539
<b>My oldest sister is pretty.</b>

639
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:05,480
<b>My second sister is amazingly smart.</b>

640
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:10,396
<b>I feel as if my older siblings
took all the good traits,</b>

641
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:15,050
<b>and I'm the one that got made
with the leftovers from them.</b>

642
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:19,789
<b>Thinking about that made me sad.</b>

643
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:24,376
<b>I wish I had just one good trait.</b>

644
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,130
<b>You're too hard on yourself.</b>

645
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:29,969
<b>All human beings...</b>

646
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:34,010
<b>have value just by existing.</b>

647
00:34:34,969 --> 00:34:37,639
<b>Why cut yourself down
by comparing yourself to others?</b>

648
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:41,079
<b>"Just be myself."
You don't know that phrase?</b>

649
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,150
<b>Just... Just be what?</b>

650
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,925
<b>You just live as yourself.</b>

651
00:34:47,949 --> 00:34:49,119
<b>Be yourself.</b>

652
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:52,590
<b>That's way cool.</b>

653
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:55,530
<b>That's a huge dignity boost.</b>

654
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,436
<b>Did you go to a good school?</b>

655
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,206
<b>Why does that matter?</b>

656
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:01,506
<b>That's a prejudice too.</b>

657
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:03,146
<b>Is your IQ over 100?</b>

658
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:04,440
<b>Yours isn't?</b>

659
00:35:07,269 --> 00:35:11,309
<b>I feel a bit tipsy now. I should go.</b>

660
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:12,880
<b>Okay. Hang on.</b>

661
00:35:13,579 --> 00:35:15,679
<b>Wait. What are you doing?</b>

662
00:35:15,849 --> 00:35:18,296
<b>I invited you for a drink.
I should buy.</b>

663
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,896
<b>What do you take me for?</b>

664
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,360
<b>I don't mind paying. Okay then.</b>

665
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,396
<b>Hang on.</b>

666
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:28,630
<b>How much do I owe you?</b>

667
00:35:28,929 --> 00:35:30,736
<b>- Wait.
- Just a moment. Hello?</b>

668
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,360
<b>It's 96 dollars.</b>

669
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:33,969
<b>What?</b>

670
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,900
<b>Nine?</b>

671
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:38,015
<b>Did you say 90?</b>

672
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:39,099
<b>Yes.</b>

673
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,639
<b>Let me see...</b>

674
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,179
<b>We had a lot.</b>

675
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,436
<b>What's this?</b>

676
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:07,929
<b>I'm sorry. Lend me 64 dollars.</b>

677
00:36:08,429 --> 00:36:10,199
<b>This means I'm paying.</b>

678
00:36:11,099 --> 00:36:12,300
<b>My gosh.</b>

679
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,539
<b>What is this?</b>

680
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:23,940
<b>What has gotten into you?
It's not like you to call first.</b>

681
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,155
<b>Tell me about it.</b>

682
00:36:25,179 --> 00:36:27,755
<b>So how have you all been these days?</b>

683
00:36:27,779 --> 00:36:30,949
<b>Must you ask when
I'm a father of twins?</b>

684
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:33,849
<b>I'm either at work
or watching my kids.</b>

685
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,695
<b>I feed them, change their diapers,
and put them to sleep.</b>

686
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:38,489
<b>Then the cycle repeats.</b>

687
00:36:39,829 --> 00:36:41,829
<b>- So he's saying he's happy.
- How did you know?</b>

688
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,646
<b>You look good too.
How's divorce treating you?</b>

689
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:48,530
<b>Good. So what?</b>

690
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:52,840
<b>Is it really nice?</b>

691
00:36:53,469 --> 00:36:54,710
<b>In what way?</b>

692
00:36:56,179 --> 00:36:57,539
<b>You know how...</b>

693
00:36:58,179 --> 00:37:00,310
<b>my ex-wife and I constantly argued.</b>

694
00:37:00,979 --> 00:37:03,250
<b>When I was still married to her,
I didn't mind Mondays.</b>

695
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:05,719
<b>Going to work was better
than staying at home.</b>

696
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:10,090
<b>One day, I stood outside my house
after coming home from work.</b>

697
00:37:11,219 --> 00:37:14,259
<b>It felt like a rock
was pressing on my heart.</b>

698
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,799
<b>I just didn't want to go inside.</b>

699
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:22,246
<b>So I decided to wait
until she fell asleep...</b>

700
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:23,969
<b>and walked toward the bench.</b>

701
00:37:25,239 --> 00:37:26,469
<b>And there was my wife.</b>

702
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:29,379
<b>She had the same idea.</b>

703
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,609
<b>So we signed the papers
the next day and went to court.</b>

704
00:37:34,579 --> 00:37:37,055
<b>You made the right choice.
You both have a right...</b>

705
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:38,750
<b>to live comfortably.</b>

706
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:43,719
<b>Anyway, it's been great.
My ex-wife agrees.</b>

707
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:46,689
<b>I feel like we were wrong
to hold onto our marriage...</b>

708
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:49,329
<b>and deprive ourselves of happiness.</b>

709
00:37:50,829 --> 00:37:53,230
<b>Relationships can be weird.</b>

710
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:56,370
<b>There was a time when we had fun...</b>

711
00:37:56,939 --> 00:37:58,340
<b>just sharing an ice cream.</b>

712
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:01,569
<b>Let me join you for that drink.
My goodness.</b>

713
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:15,420
<b>Don't deny it.</b>

714
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:17,866
<b>We drifted apart...</b>

715
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:20,659
<b>and became
no better than strangers...</b>

716
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:22,400
<b>since that day.</b>

717
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,969
<b>I felt guilty...</b>

718
00:38:26,469 --> 00:38:28,300
<b>and you resented me.</b>

719
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:37,556
<b>This is my first time making soup,</b>

720
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:39,349
<b>but I think I did better
than my mom.</b>

721
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:43,150
<b>You need to eat well
at times like this, okay?</b>

722
00:38:43,379 --> 00:38:45,179
<b>Please eat even though
you don't feel like it.</b>

723
00:38:46,219 --> 00:38:47,319
<b>Sorry.</b>

724
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:49,960
<b>I don't want to.</b>

725
00:38:50,219 --> 00:38:51,719
<b>I'll get to it later.</b>

726
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:40,810
<b>Shouldn't you be resting some more?</b>

727
00:39:40,939 --> 00:39:42,455
<b>I got your favorite...</b>

728
00:39:42,479 --> 00:39:43,780
<b>Did you throw them away?</b>

729
00:39:45,879 --> 00:39:46,909
<b>Yes.</b>

730
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:49,949
<b>They just seemed to be taking space.</b>

731
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:53,319
<b>We could buy new ones
when we need them.</b>

732
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:58,096
<b>Who gave you the right
to throw them all away?</b>

733
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,159
<b>You should've discussed it with me!</b>

734
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:03,430
<b>Good for you...</b>

735
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:06,870
<b>for being able to move on so easily.</b>

736

and patbingsu there.</b>

769
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:47,089
<b>We used to love their patbingsu.</b>

770
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:54,689
<b>Why don't we go there
for old times' sake?</b>

771
00:43:58,399 --> 00:44:00,529
<b>It shut down two years ago.</b>

772
00:44:01,769 --> 00:44:02,839
<b>Also,</b>

773
00:44:03,899 --> 00:44:05,810
<b>I don't like patbingsu anymore.</b>

774
00:44:25,389 --> 00:44:27,365
<b>Da Hee, breakfast is ready!</b>

775
00:44:27,389 --> 00:44:29,036
<b>My gosh.</b>

776
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:30,459
<b>Gosh, it reeks of alcohol.</b>

777
00:44:31,199 --> 00:44:34,829
<b>Why does it smell
like an old man lives here?</b>

778
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:36,476
<b>Last One.</b>

779
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:38,315
<b>Wake up.
You should get ready for work.</b>

780
00:44:38,339 --> 00:44:39,946
<b>Mom cooked
dried pollack soup for you.</b>

781
00:44:39,970 --> 00:44:41,509
<b>Wake up already.</b>

782
00:44:42,009 --> 00:44:43,685
<b>Let me be.</b>

783
00:44:43,709 --> 00:44:45,386
<b>I'm not going to work today.</b>

784
00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:46,649
<b>Why not?</b>

785
00:44:47,079 --> 00:44:48,625
<b>Are you still drunk?</b>

786
00:44:48,649 --> 00:44:50,180
<b>I don't have to.</b>

787
00:44:50,379 --> 00:44:53,090
<b>- I'm taking the day off.
- What?</b>

788
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,190
<b>Can interns do that?</b>

789
00:44:55,450 --> 00:44:57,559
<b>What if you get fired for this?</b>

790
00:44:58,789 --> 00:45:00,105
<b>So what if I'm an intern?</b>

791
00:45:00,129 --> 00:45:01,830
<b>Aren't interns
allowed vacation days?</b>

792
00:45:02,429 --> 00:45:03,709
<b>I'm going back to bed, so leave.</b>

793
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,176
<b>Get out of here!</b>

794
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,905
<b>My gosh. All right.
There's no need to throw a fit.</b>

795
00:45:08,929 --> 00:45:10,700
<b>Go back to bed.</b>

796
00:45:11,399 --> 00:45:12,940
<b>Unbelievable.</b>

797
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:19,679
<b>Da Hee has adopted
quite the temper these days.</b>

798
00:45:20,049 --> 00:45:21,379
<b>Isn't she getting up?</b>

799
00:45:21,610 --> 00:45:23,010
<b>She's taking the day off from work.</b>

800
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:25,220
<b>She even raised her voice
and threw a fit.</b>

801
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:27,096
<b>That's not like her.</b>

802
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:28,865
<b>I'm guessing she's still
not over the annulment.</b>

803
00:45:28,889 --> 00:45:31,796
<b>She had a team dinner last night,
so I'm sure she's tired.</b>

804
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:33,635
<b>Just let her get enough sleep.</b>

805
00:45:33,659 --> 00:45:34,936
<b>Sure thing, Father.</b>

806
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,635
<b>That workplace of hers...</b>

807
00:45:36,659 --> 00:45:38,375
<b>constantly has team dinners
and eats late at night.</b>

808
00:45:38,399 --> 00:45:39,806
<b>If only they'd pay her enough.</b>

809
00:45:39,830 --> 00:45:41,600
<b>What do you expect
when she's only an intern?</b>

810
00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:44,070
<b>It's not easy earning money
from other people, you know.</b>

811
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:47,840
<b>You're saying that as if
you're out there making a living.</b>

812
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,655
<b>Of course, I am.</b>

813
00:45:49,679 --> 00:45:51,316
<b>I'm receiving child support.</b>

814
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:52,379
<b>Unbelievable.</b>

815
00:45:52,809 --> 00:45:53,980
<b>Keep it down...</b>

816
00:45:54,009 --> 00:45:55,750
<b>- and go back to your meal.
- Got it.</b>

817
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,956
<b>Are you taking Ji Hun
to his father today?</b>

818
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:02,166
<b>Yes, he said he was busy,
but I guess he made time.</b>

819
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:04,490
<b>- Really, Mom?
- Of course.</b>

820
00:46:04,659 --> 00:46:07,105
<b>He'll pick you up from school,
so come straight out.</b>

821
00:46:07,129 --> 00:46:09,635
<b>Yes, Mom.
I'll get ready for school then.</b>

822
00:46:09,659 --> 00:46:10,929
<b>Thank you for the meal.</b>

823
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:12,500
<b>You should eat some more!</b>

824
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:16,539
<b>He sure is young, isn't he?
He's thrilled to see his dad.</b>

825
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,946
<b>Just so you know,
I have work today.</b>

826
00:46:18,970 --> 00:46:20,769
<b>- No one asked.
- Got it.</b>

827
00:46:37,659 --> 00:46:40,059
<b>Get in. Let's go to work together.</b>

828
00:46:40,389 --> 00:46:42,460
<b>Forget it. I'll just take a cab.</b>

829
00:46:42,659 --> 00:46:45,299
<b>There's really no need for that.</b>

830
00:46:45,899 --> 00:46:46,929
<b>Hop in.</b>

831
00:46:56,639 --> 00:46:57,840
<b>Let's do it.</b>

832
00:46:59,809 --> 00:47:02,049
<b>Let's get divorced.</b>

833
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:07,910
<b>We'll head to the court together
after work.</b>

834
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:10,659
<b>I'll stop by your office.</b>

835
00:47:13,289 --> 00:47:14,789
<b>All right.</b>

836
00:47:22,429 --> 00:47:26,015
<b>I got it. I said I wouldn't be late.</b>

837
00:47:26,039 --> 00:47:27,909
<b>- Dad!
- I'll call you back.</b>

838
00:47:28,039 --> 00:47:29,985
<b>Ji Hun, how have you been?</b>

839
00:47:30,009 --> 00:47:31,909
<b>- Have you been well too?
- Of course.</b>

840
00:47:33,110 --> 00:47:35,826
<b>Bring him home by 10 p.m.
He has homework to do.</b>

841
00:47:35,850 --> 00:47:37,250
<b>Got it.</b>

842
00:47:38,019 --> 00:47:39,990
<b>Wait, did you dye your hair?</b>

843
00:47:40,350 --> 00:47:42,389
<b>Right, that color
definitely suits you.</b>

844
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:45,360
<b>Meanwhile, you're losing your hair.</b>

845
00:47:45,889 --> 00:47:47,865
<b>You should watch out
since you're dating someone young.</b>

846
00:47:47,889 --> 00:47:48,960
<b>Is that so?</b>

847
00:47:49,429 --> 00:47:50,605
<b>Is it bad?</b>

848
00:47:50,629 --> 00:47:52,676
<b>I've been applying
some ointment these days.</b>

849
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:54,846
<b>Whatever you do
is none of my business,</b>

850
00:47:54,870 --> 00:47:56,110
<b>so just bring him back on time.</b>

851
00:47:57,070 --> 00:47:58,370
<b>Ji Hun, I'll see you later.</b>

852
00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:03,086
<b>Do you think I lost a lot of hair?</b>

853
00:48:03,110 --> 00:48:05,316
<b>- No, you look great.
- Right?</b>

854
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:06,480
<b>That's my boy.</b>

855
00:48:06,679 --> 00:48:08,649
<b>Why did she have
to annoy me like that?</b>

856
00:48:09,649 --> 00:48:10,950
<b>Have you been well?</b>

857
00:48:11,919 --> 00:48:14,196
<b>I said I won't be late.</b>

858
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:15,690
<b>Must you buy it today of all days?</b>

859
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:20,059
<b>I have to, at least once a month.</b>

860
00:48:21,129 --> 00:48:22,289
<b>You know that.</b>

861
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:24,700
<b>What's up with you today?</b>

862
00:48:25,299 --> 00:48:27,200
<b>Hold on a second...</b>

863
00:48:27,629 --> 00:48:30,139
<b>Hello? Unbelievable.</b>

864
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:33,269
<b>Go ahead. Dig in.</b>

865
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:36,139
<b>- Dad.
- Yes?</b>

866
00:48:39,179 --> 00:48:40,686
<b>- I'm going to the restroom.
- Sure.</b>

867
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:42,149
<b>Go ahead.</b>

868
00:48:43,149 --> 00:48:45,895
<b>How can you hang up on me like that?</b>

869
00:48:45,919 --> 00:48:48,649
<b>Must I go with you to buy that?</b>

870
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:54,259
<b>Mom...</b>

871
00:49:17,649 --> 00:49:20,649
<b>Make the swings bigger like so.</b>

872
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:21,889
<b>That's right.</b>

873
00:49:22,350 --> 00:49:25,166
<b>Jun Yeong, you can't be like this.</b>

874
00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:27,759
<b>You agreed to film
the motorcycle scene yourself.</b>

875
00:49:27,889 --> 00:49:30,905
<b>I don't think I'm in
the perfect condition though.</b>

876
00:49:30,929 --> 00:49:32,846
<b>Have one of my boys do the scene.</b>

877
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:34,806
<b>Out of the blue?
Would it be all right?</b>

878
00:49:34,830 --> 00:49:36,340
<b>It's what we're paid to do.</b>

879
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:39,509
<b>- Jeong Bong, let's talk.
- Sure.</b>

880
00:49:42,509 --> 00:49:44,539
<b>You're closest to
his height and build.</b>

881
00:49:44,809 --> 00:49:46,450
<b>You'll be filming
a motorcycle scene.</b>

882
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:48,179
<b>A motorcycle?</b>

883
00:49:48,379 --> 00:49:50,726
<b>That's not really my specialty.</b>

884
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:52,556
<b>As if that's important.</b>

885
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:54,690
<b>You probably know
how to ride one though.</b>

886
00:49:54,919 --> 00:49:56,936
<b>Come on, Mr. Jang.</b>

887
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,806
<b>You can't make him film the scene
without giving him a heads-up.</b>

888
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:01,590
<b>It's nothing too difficult,
so he'll be fine.</b>

889
00:50:01,789 --> 00:50:03,105
<b>I'll teach you the route...</b>

890
00:50:03,129 --> 00:50:06,100
<b>A stunt shouldn't be performed
just because it can be done.</b>

891
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:07,905
<b>Out on the field,
accidents happen...</b>

892
00:50:07,929 --> 00:50:09,470
<b>even when all precautions are taken.</b>

893
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,245
<b>You can't keep accepting
requests like this.</b>

894
00:50:12,269 --> 00:50:13,870
<b>We only have one life, you know.</b>

895
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:16,716
<b>Tell him it can't be done
unless you'll be doing it yourself.</b>

896
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:17,940
<b>What?</b>

897
00:50:23,279 --> 00:50:24,649
<b>Mr. Jang, come on over.</b>

898
00:50:24,850 --> 00:50:27,066
<b>We'll cut out the motorcycle scene
and save some time.</b>

899
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:28,289
<b>Sure thing.</b>

900
00:50:30,389 --> 00:50:32,035
<b>Guys, stretch out your limbs.</b>

901
00:50:32,059 --> 00:50:34,190
<b>Taller ones to the back,
shorter ones to the front.</b>

902
00:50:39,899 --> 00:50:41,399
<b>Look at her handwriting.</b>

903
00:50:41,899 --> 00:50:44,240
<b>Oddly enough, she's a funny one.</b>

904
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:51,480
<b>You never know,
so I'll keep it as a lucky charm.</b>

905
00:50:55,379 --> 00:50:58,279
<b>Mom, must you be this relentless?</b>

906
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,105
<b>Hi, Mom.</b>

907
00:51:06,129 --> 00:51:08,265
<b>Jae Seok, where on earth are you?</b>

908
00:51:08,289 --> 00:51:11,330
<b>I'm in Turkey, of course.
I just woke up.</b>

909
00:51:11,429 --> 00:51:12,745
<b>Are you kidding me?</b>

910
00:51:12,769 --> 00:51:15,629
<b>Why do you keep dodging my calls?
Why won't you call back?</b>

911
00:51:15,830 --> 00:51:17,546
<b>- I'm sorry.
- Did you call Dr. Kim?</b>

912
00:51:17,570 --> 00:51:18,970
<b>Yes, just a second ago.</b>

913
00:51:20,169 --> 00:51:22,210
<b>Wait. What was that?</b>

914
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:25,480
<b>I think I heard Korean just now.</b>

915
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:27,950
<b>- Right?
- Mom,</b>

916
00:51:29,210 --> 00:51:31,726
<b>it was Korean TV.
I fell asleep while watching it.</b>

917
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:32,995
<b>I guess it kept going all night.</b>

918
00:51:33,019 --> 00:51:35,365
<b>I'm running late,
so I should get ready.</b>

919
00:51:35,389 --> 00:51:36,995

<b>Okay. Let's just say that it is.</b>

<b>- Do you understand?
- Okay. I get it.</b>

<b>I wondered why things were
so peaceful between you and me.</b>

<b>That's what I was going to say.</b>

989

<b>I thought it was awkward.</b>

990

<b>What will you do with our house?
Will you put it up for sale?</b>

997
00:56:15,930 --> 00:56:17,716
<b>Let's go then.</b>

998
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:19,599
<b>You should go that way.</b>

999

<b>- We'd like to sell urgently.
- We'd like to sell urgently.</b>

00:56:25,539 --> 00:56:29,156
<b>Well... This isn't the right time.</b>

<b>We don't know how

<b>I don't care.</b>

1004

<b>I don't mind losing money.
Just put it up for sale.</b>

<b>If you want to sell it urgently,</b>

1008

<b>Right.</b>

<b>You have no idea at your age.</b>

<b>Actually, there was something

<b>I want to heal angels

<b>I had to study a lot

<b>Unfortunately, I wasn't

<b>So I just gave up.</b>

<b>Get going if you're done. It's late.</b>

1069
00:59:54,349 --> 00:59:55,549
<b>Thank you.</b>

1070
00:59:56,119 --> 00:59:57,119
<b>What?</b>

1071
00:59:57,890 --> 00:59:59,490
<b>Okay. I should go.</b>

1072
01:00:00,390 --> 01:00:01,466
<b>Gosh.</b>

1073
01:00:01,490 --> 01:00:02,589
<b>Bye.</b>

1074
01:00:03,859 --> 01:00:06,275
<b>I'm home. Dad!</b>

1075
01:00:06,299 --> 01:00:09,206
<b>Hello, sweetheart. You're home late.</b>

1076
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:12,146
<b>I had an extra class.</b>

1077
01:00:12,170 --> 01:00:14,716
<b>What are you doing here?
Are you sleeping over?</b>

1078
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:15,845
<b>What?</b>

1079
01:00:15,869 --> 01:00:17,656
<b>Are you two living together now?</b>

1080
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,055
<b>It's not like that.</b>

1081
01:00:19,079 --> 01:00:20,985
<b>He just dropped by
to bring Seo Jin home.</b>

1082
01:00:21,009 --> 01:00:22,849
<b>Is that it? I see.</b>

1083
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:26,380
<b>All right.
I should get going then. Bye.</b>

1084
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:28,565
<b>Make sure to turn off the tap.</b>

1085
01:00:28,589 --> 01:00:30,436
<b>If the toilet leaks again, call me.</b>

1086
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:31,595
<b>Okay. Thank you.</b>

1087
01:00:31,619 --> 01:00:33,859
<b>- Bye, Dad. I'll text you.
- Okay.</b>

1088
01:00:36,259 --> 01:00:38,235
<b>Why? What?</b>

1089
01:00:38,259 --> 01:00:41,069
<b>I smell food. You should've let him
stay for dinner.</b>

1090
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:43,900
<b>Dad likes your doenjang jjigae.</b>

1091
01:00:44,539 --> 01:00:46,176
<b>Don't be silly. Just go wash up.</b>

1092
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:47,710
<b>And wake Seo Jin up.</b>

1093
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:48,940
<b>Mom.</b>

1094
01:00:49,170 --> 01:00:51,815
<b>I read an article on the Internet.
A child from a divorced family...</b>

1095
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:55,285
<b>might suffer from a sense of loss,
anxiety, and fear.</b>

1096
01:00:55,309 --> 01:00:57,696
<b>So I'd like you to try...</b>

1097
01:00:57,720 --> 01:00:59,525
<b>to get back together with Dad...</b>

1098
01:00:59,549 --> 01:01:02,019
<b>for my sake. Okay?</b>

1099
01:01:02,119 --> 01:01:04,460
<b>You took an exam
at the academy today, didn't you?</b>

1100
01:01:06,019 --> 01:01:09,890
<b>Seo Jin. Wake up, Seo Jin. I'm home.</b>

1101
01:01:19,869 --> 01:01:21,009
<b>It must be delicious.</b>

1102
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:24,109
<b>Hyun Gyung makes
really good doenjang jjigae.</b>

1103
01:01:36,549 --> 01:01:39,859
<b>What do you want?
Shall we sell the house?</b>

1104
01:01:40,019 --> 01:01:42,166
<b>We should.
We can't get a new place...</b>

1105
01:01:42,190 --> 01:01:43,606
<b>unless we sell this house.</b>

1106
01:01:43,630 --> 01:01:45,759
<b>I know. I guess you're right.</b>

1107
01:01:46,630 --> 01:01:49,946
<b>But I heard the house price
might bounce back in a few months.</b>

1108
01:01:49,970 --> 01:01:52,045
<b>It's not a few months.
It might happen in a few weeks.</b>

1109
01:01:52,069 --> 01:01:53,585
<b>It has just hit bottom.</b>

1110
01:01:53,609 --> 01:01:56,216
<b>And we have to lower
the price by 100,000 dollars.</b>

1111
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:58,680
<b>That's a huge loss.</b>

1112
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:01,386
<b>I guess an expert
dissuades us for a reason.</b>

1113
01:02:01,410 --> 01:02:02,450
<b>Okay.</b>

1114
01:02:04,319 --> 01:02:05,595
<b>My point.</b>

1115
01:02:05,619 --> 01:02:08,565
<b>So let's be honest with each other.</b>

1116
01:02:08,589 --> 01:02:11,565
<b>Let's not be emotional.
We should think reasonably.</b>

1117
01:02:11,589 --> 01:02:14,460
<b>Do you think 100,000 dollars
is little money?</b>

1118
01:02:16,490 --> 01:02:19,299
<b>No. We've worked really hard
to save that money.</b>

1119
01:02:19,359 --> 01:02:20,775
<b>We've gone through our internship
and residency training...</b>

1120
01:02:20,799 --> 01:02:23,670
<b>in so many operating rooms
to save that money.</b>

1121
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:24,946
<b>I know.
That's how hard we've worked.</b>

1122
01:02:24,970 --> 01:02:27,186
<b>We can't lose that money
in the heat of the moment.</b>

1123
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:30,255
<b>We're not that foolish.
We are intellectual people.</b>

1124
01:02:30,279 --> 01:02:31,809
<b>I don't know about you, but I am.</b>

1125
01:02:32,539 --> 01:02:35,609
<b>Let's not put it up for sale
so urgently.</b>

1126
01:02:35,779 --> 01:02:39,095
<b>Even if it takes time, we should
receive a reasonable price. Okay?</b>

1127
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:41,089
<b>Good. Until then,</b>

1128
01:02:41,849 --> 01:02:43,196
<b>we stay here together.</b>

1129
01:02:43,220 --> 01:02:45,319
<b>Okay, although it doesn't
mean anything.</b>

1130
01:02:45,490 --> 01:02:46,936
<b>We're just sharing the house.</b>

1131
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:48,460
<b>We're like housemates.</b>

1132
01:02:48,930 --> 01:02:50,900
<b>Housemates sound good. Okay.</b>

1133
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:53,505
<b>But we should respect
each other's privacy.</b>

1134
01:02:53,529 --> 01:02:54,676
<b>Of course.</b>

1135
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:57,599
<b>I will be at the hospital all day
and just sleep here anyway.</b>

1136
01:02:58,069 --> 01:03:01,009
<b>I'll sleep in the bedroom,
and you'll sleep in the living room.</b>

1137
01:03:02,210 --> 01:03:03,269
<b>Okay.</b>

1138
01:03:04,009 --> 01:03:07,686
<b>So we will share this house
for the time being.</b>

1139
01:03:07,710 --> 01:03:11,950
<b>Deal. Why don't we have
a written contract then?</b>

1140
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:13,890
<b>Deal.</b>

1141
01:03:13,950 --> 01:03:15,196
<b>(Cohabitation)</b>

1142
01:03:15,220 --> 01:03:18,160
<b>Cohabitation Contract.</b>

1143
01:03:19,190 --> 01:03:22,460
<b>One. Song Na Hee
occupies the bedroom...</b>

1144
01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:25,559
<b>and Yoon Gyu Jin occupies
the living room.</b>

1145
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:28,946
<b>Article 1, Clause 1. Cleaning
and interior design are left...</b>

1146
01:03:28,970 --> 01:03:30,616
<b>to the owner's discretion.</b>

1147
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:33,845
<b>Two. The rest of the house
is owned communally.</b>

1148
01:03:33,869 --> 01:03:35,315
<b>So it should be cleaned
by both parties.</b>

1149
01:03:35,339 --> 01:03:38,616
<b>Article 2, Clause 1.
Every Sunday at 9 a.m.,</b>

1150
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:40,456
<b>there should be
a general house cleaning.</b>

1151
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:43,849
<b>The kitchen is cleaned by Song
and the bathroom is cleaned by Yoon.</b>

1152
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:47,295
<b>Seven. Both parties must attend
family occasions...</b>

1153
01:03:47,319 --> 01:03:50,420
<b>like birthdays, national holidays,
or ancestral rites.</b>

1154
01:03:50,490 --> 01:03:52,666
<b>For other occasions,
prior notice must be given.</b>

1155
01:03:52,690 --> 01:03:54,990
<b>And they are attended
by mutual consent only.</b>

1156
01:03:55,930 --> 01:03:59,099
<b>Eight. This agreement shall not be
disclosed to anyone.</b>

1157
01:03:59,259 --> 01:04:00,876
<b>The one who discloses it
takes full responsibility...</b>

1158
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:03,869
<b>and moves out,
forfeiting all shares in the house.</b>

1159
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:08,640
<b>Is there anything you want to add?</b>

1160
01:04:11,710 --> 01:04:13,480
<b>No. It's perfect.</b>

1161
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:16,426
<b>This is the most important clause.</b>

1162

<b>"The one who discloses it
takes full responsibility..."</b>

1163
01:04:18,519 --> 01:04:20,866
<b>"and moves out,
forfeiting all shares in the house."</b>

1164
01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:22,426
<b>You bet.</b>

1165
01:04:22,450 --> 01:04:24,396
<b>Say we're living together
when we're divorced.</b>

1166
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:26,059
<b>Our parents would all faint.</b>

1167
01:04:26,420 --> 01:04:28,936
<b>What about at work?
We don't have to lie to them.</b>

1168
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:30,376
<b>We can't tell for a while.</b>

1169
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:33,230
<b>Once the director finds out,
it's only time until Mom does.</b>

1170
01:04:33,930 --> 01:04:36,670
<b>You're right. We shouldn't tell
our colleagues for a while too.</b>

1171
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,839
<b>Let's print the contract.</b>

1172
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:40,039
<b>Okay.</b>

1173
01:04:41,009 --> 01:04:42,210
<b>Are you home?</b>

1174
01:04:43,109 --> 01:04:45,440
<b>How much fun did you have
that you're sleepy already?</b>

1175
01:04:45,509 --> 01:04:46,779
<b>Was it that much fun?</b>

1176
01:04:48,049 --> 01:04:50,079
<b>Yes. I had fun.</b>

1177
01:04:51,619 --> 01:04:55,349
<b>Hey, I get jealous
if you have too much fun.</b>

1178
01:04:56,119 --> 01:04:57,420
<b>Tell the truth.</b>

1179
01:04:57,519 --> 01:05:00,136
<b>If Mom and Dad are drowning,
who will you save first?</b>

1180
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:01,759
<b>I can't swim.</b>

1181
01:05:01,890 --> 01:05:04,859
<b>Don't try to talk your way out.</b>

1182
01:05:05,130 --> 01:05:07,376
<b>Who will you save first?
Who will you save?</b>

1183
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:09,476
<b>- Who will you save?
- That tickles.</b>

1184
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:11,839
<b>- Stop it.
- I won't.</b>

1185
01:05:17,910 --> 01:05:18,916
<b>Ji Hun wants to sleep.</b>

1186
01:05:18,940 --> 01:05:20,820
<b>He must be tired
after hanging out with his dad.</b>

1187
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:23,825
<b>Do you still have half the melon?</b>

1188
01:05:23,849 --> 01:05:26,220
<b>Give him some when he wakes.
This was expensive.</b>

1189
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:29,349
<b>You're showing off
with a melon you got on sale?</b>

1190
01:05:29,549 --> 01:05:31,535
<b>It's still an expensive melon.</b>

1191
01:05:31,559 --> 01:05:33,930
<b>Okay, fine. I get it.</b>

1192
01:05:35,690 --> 01:05:38,500
<b>Why do you keep
looking at the front door?</b>

1193
01:05:38,829 --> 01:05:39,900
<b>Why is that?</b>

1194
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,245
<b>Are you hopeful because
Joon Seon went to Hyun Gyung's?</b>

1195
01:05:42,269 --> 01:05:45,245
<b>I'm not hopeful.
Don't you make things up.</b>

1196
01:05:45,269 --> 01:05:46,575
<b>As if.</b>

1197
01:05:46,599 --> 01:05:49,085
<b>You're just looking for an excuse
to get them back together.</b>

1198
01:05:49,109 --> 01:05:50,309
<b>- Right?
- You're right.</b>

1199
01:05:50,779 --> 01:05:52,279
<b>- I'm home!
- That's him.</b>

1200
01:05:53,650 --> 01:05:55,710
<b>How come we're having melon?</b>

1201
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:59,126
<b>Why are you back so late?</b>

1202
01:05:59,150 --> 01:06:01,626
<b>Did Hyun Gyung make you dinner?</b>

1203
01:06:01,650 --> 01:06:03,519
<b>No. I fixed something for her.</b>

1204
01:06:03,890 --> 01:06:04,867
<b>And then?</b>

1205
01:06:04,891 --> 01:06:06,819
<b>I left because she told me to.</b>

1206
01:06:07,029 --> 01:06:08,529
<b>Is that it?</b>

1207
01:06:08,690 --> 01:06:10,759
<b>Darn it. And I thought...</b>

1208
01:06:11,859 --> 01:06:15,176
<b>She denied it, but look at her
looking all disappointed.</b>

1209
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:16,946
<b>I know. It's too obvious.</b>

1210
01:06:16,970 --> 01:06:18,440
<b>It shows.</b>

1211
01:06:18,569 --> 01:06:20,745
<b>- Cut them into smaller pieces.
- Joon Seon.</b>

1212
01:06:20,769 --> 01:06:22,470
<b>- Okay.
- You can't eat them all.</b>

1213
01:06:22,710 --> 01:06:24,039
<b>Wasn't it for me?</b>

1214
01:06:24,339 --> 01:06:26,686
<b>Make sure the skin is thin.</b>

1215
01:06:26,710 --> 01:06:27,726
<b>Okay!</b>

1216
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:29,426
<b>Da Hee, come over here.</b>

1217
01:06:29,450 --> 01:06:31,095
<b>Have some fruit.</b>

1218
01:06:31,119 --> 01:06:34,319
<b>Here. We got it for cheap,
but it's really sweet.</b>

1219
01:06:37,059 --> 01:06:39,420
<b>Listen, Mom, Dad.</b>

1220
01:06:39,559 --> 01:06:41,430
<b>I have something to say.</b>

1221
01:06:41,990 --> 01:06:44,230
<b>Why are you suddenly being
so awkward and polite?</b>

1222
01:06:44,829 --> 01:06:46,630
<b>You're not getting back with...</b>

1223
01:06:46,829 --> 01:06:47,806
<b>No, right?</b>

1224
01:06:47,830 --> 01:06:49,069
<b>I...</b>

1225
01:06:50,369 --> 01:06:54,670
<b>What do you want to say
that you're so serious? Just say it.</b>

1226
01:06:54,710 --> 01:06:57,785
<b>Yes. We're used to getting
shocking news,</b>

1227
01:06:57,809 --> 01:06:59,880
<b>so nothing's bad anymore. Say it.</b>

1228
01:07:00,779 --> 01:07:02,380
<b>I quit my job.</b>

1229
01:07:05,650 --> 01:07:08,426
<b>Why? Why did you quit?</b>

1230
01:07:08,450 --> 01:07:10,289
<b>Did you quit or get fired?</b>

1231
01:07:10,690 --> 01:07:12,460
<b>Half and half.</b>

1232
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:15,529
<b>And there's one more thing.</b>

1233
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,230
<b>There's more?</b>

1234
01:07:19,329 --> 01:07:21,900
<b>The contract stands
until this apartment is sold.</b>

1235
01:07:22,130 --> 01:07:24,069
<b>Any objections, Ms. Song Na Hee?</b>

1236
01:07:24,369 --> 01:07:26,339
<b>No. No objections.</b>

1237
01:07:26,470 --> 01:07:27,509
<b>Then...</b>

1238
01:07:29,869 --> 01:07:31,339
<b>(Yoon Gyu Jin)</b>

1239
01:07:34,549 --> 01:07:35,779
<b>(Song Na Hee)</b>

1240
01:07:36,180 --> 01:07:37,220
<b>There.</b>

1241
01:07:39,750 --> 01:07:43,220
<b>I hope we get along, housemate.</b>

1242
01:07:45,190 --> 01:07:46,359
<b>Same here.</b>

1243
01:07:51,130 --> 01:07:52,430
<b>I'll...</b>

1244
01:07:57,799 --> 01:07:59,640
<b>I'll go back to university.</b>

1245
01:08:00,839 --> 01:08:02,039
<b>- What?
- What?</b>

1246
01:08:02,140 --> 01:08:04,039
<b>University? What university?</b>

1247
01:08:04,309 --> 01:08:07,680
<b>I'll study and transfer to
a four-year university.</b>

1248
01:08:08,210 --> 01:08:10,250
<b>Mom. Dad.</b>

1249
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:41,849
<b>(Once Again)</b>

1250
01:08:42,079 --> 01:08:43,226
<b>Na Hee!</b>

1251
01:08:43,250 --> 01:08:44,795
<b>Clause three of
the Cohabitation Code.</b>

1252
01:08:44,819 --> 01:08:47,849
<b>You never touch
your housemate's belongings.</b>

1253
01:08:48,089 --> 01:08:49,390
<b>Wait, stop.</b>

1254
01:08:49,519 --> 01:08:51,366
<b>Clause five of
the Cohabitation Code.</b>

1255
01:08:51,390 --> 01:08:53,095
<b>Did you not memorize that one?</b>

1256
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:55,166
<b>- Darn it.
- Why are you so annoyed?</b>

1257
01:08:55,190 --> 01:08:56,406
<b>Did you and Na Hee fight again?</b>

1258
01:08:56,430 --> 01:08:59,059
<b>Why do you want to know
what goes on in my private life?</b>

1259
01:08:59,559 --> 01:09:00,900
<b>You got divorced?</b>

1260
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:02,775
<b>Divorced?</b>

1261
01:09:02,799 --> 01:09:05,769
<b>You're belittling me, aren't you?</b>

1262
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:07,839
<b>Get the hostess!</b>

1263
01:09:08,069 --> 01:09:09,809
<b>The hostess is right here.</b>

1264
01:09:12,140 --> 01:09:13,440
<b>What's the problem?</b>
