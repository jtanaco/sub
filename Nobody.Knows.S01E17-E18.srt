00:00:52,722 --> 00:00:55,453
<b>(Episode 9)</b>

2
00:00:55,796 --> 00:00:57,148
<b>What are you doing
in someone else's house?</b>

3
00:00:57,398 --> 00:00:59,099
<b>It's someone else's place
for you too.</b>

4
00:01:00,405 --> 00:01:02,903
<b>I called you many times
to see you.</b>

5
00:01:03,859 --> 00:01:05,859
<b>Do you remember me?
We met at school earlier today.</b>

6
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:10,898
<b>Sorry I touched it
without any permission.</b>

7
00:01:11,178 --> 00:01:13,859
<b>I did it because I wanted
to talk to you alone.</b>

8
00:01:23,462 --> 00:01:24,344
<b>It must be hard...</b>

9
00:01:25,266 --> 00:01:27,361
<b>by the thought that your friend died
because of you.</b>

10
00:01:30,816 --> 00:01:32,327
<b>Why is it because of me?</b>

11
00:01:32,955 --> 00:01:34,635
<b>It's not like I told him to die.</b>

12
00:01:34,676 --> 00:01:37,604
<b>If you think so,
that makes me feel relieved.</b>

13
00:01:38,945 --> 00:01:40,070
<b>Let's talk for a few minutes.</b>

14
00:01:40,406 --> 00:01:42,343
<b>Are you really Eun Ho's friend?</b>

15
00:01:42,543 --> 00:01:43,344
<b>Yes.</b>

16
00:01:44,094 --> 00:01:45,633
<b>Like you and Choi Dae Hoon.</b>

17
00:01:46,247 --> 00:01:49,817
<b>You look comfortable
in the photo I found in his phone.</b>

18
00:02:01,895 --> 00:02:04,131
<b>I heard everything
from Detective Hwang.</b>

19
00:02:04,132 --> 00:02:05,000
<b>He said...</b>

20
00:02:06,594 --> 00:02:08,594
<b>he'd scare him a bit. That's all.</b>

21
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:09,803
<b>I believe you.</b>

22
00:02:10,604 --> 00:02:13,073
<b>But I don't believe
that Eun Ho extorted money.</b>

23
00:02:13,407 --> 00:02:14,641
<b>Because you're on Eun Ho's side.</b>

24
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:19,413
<b>I thought he was a boy who couldn't
tell a lie or do bad things.</b>

25
00:02:19,789 --> 00:02:21,305
<b>But I was wrong.</b>

26
00:02:21,306 --> 00:02:23,476
<b>He could do anything
if he wanted to.</b>

27
00:02:23,751 --> 00:02:25,719
<b>However, I realized one thing
for sure.</b>

28
00:02:26,153 --> 00:02:28,297
<b>He has neither told a lie
nor done a bad thing...</b>

29
00:02:28,822 --> 00:02:30,883
<b>just for himself.</b>

30
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:39,566
<b>Doesn't it hurt?</b>

31
00:02:41,546 --> 00:02:43,843
<b>- Of course, it does.
- But does it...</b>

32
00:02:45,055 --> 00:02:46,367
<b>lessen your sadness?</b>

33
00:02:48,195 --> 00:02:50,195
<b>The better your condition gets,</b>

34
00:02:51,859 --> 00:02:53,981
<b>the less you'll hurt yourself.</b>

35
00:02:54,381 --> 00:02:55,382
<b>How do I get better?</b>

36
00:02:55,749 --> 00:02:58,234
<b>Eun Ho got injured and Dae Hoon died
because of me.</b>

37
00:02:58,485 --> 00:03:00,476
<b>How would I ever feel better?</b>

38
00:03:11,406 --> 00:03:12,566
<b>One of my friends...</b>

39
00:03:14,766 --> 00:03:16,403
<b>was killed by a murderer...</b>

40
00:03:17,004 --> 00:03:18,531
<b>when she was 18.</b>

41
00:03:19,606 --> 00:03:22,180
<b>She called me three times
before she was killed,</b>

42
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,977
<b>but I was just lazy
and didn't answer them.</b>

43
00:03:24,484 --> 00:03:26,976
<b>I'd thought she died
because of me for a long time.</b>

44
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:31,652
<b>But that's an awful idea.</b>

45
00:03:32,836 --> 00:03:35,055
<b>Whether I'd answered her calls
or not,</b>

46
00:03:35,956 --> 00:03:37,925
<b>murder must've not been committed
in the first place.</b>

47
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:42,596
<b>It's the murderer that's thoroughly
responsible for my friend's death.</b>

48
00:03:43,648 --> 00:03:45,032
<b>It's the same for you.</b>

49
00:03:45,332 --> 00:03:48,635
<b>Eun Ho's fall and Dae Hoon's death
aren't your faults.</b>

50
00:03:48,636 --> 00:03:49,914
<b>Your fault is...</b>

51
00:03:50,838 --> 00:03:53,312
<b>that you neglected the violence
Eun Ho was about to fall victim to.</b>

52
00:03:53,741 --> 00:03:54,875
<b>That's all.</b>

53
00:03:55,809 --> 00:03:57,773
<b>What happened after that...</b>

54
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,539
<b>has nothing to do with you.</b>

55
00:04:08,788 --> 00:04:10,257
<b>It's not your fault.</b>

56
00:04:11,945 --> 00:04:13,160
<b>Uncle Dae Hoon.</b>

57
00:04:17,264 --> 00:04:18,332
<b>Uncle Dae Hoon.</b>

58
00:04:47,773 --> 00:04:48,929
<b>Ki Ho.</b>

59
00:04:52,366 --> 00:04:54,134
<b>It's been a while.</b>

60
00:05:05,828 --> 00:05:06,813
<b>Who are you?</b>

61
00:05:07,499 --> 00:05:08,594
<b>Oh, well.</b>

62
00:05:08,788 --> 00:05:11,156
<b>Don't you go to New Life Church?</b>

63
00:05:11,157 --> 00:05:12,386
<b>- What?
- I...</b>

64
00:05:12,387 --> 00:05:15,055
<b>just saw the picture of it,
so I came in.</b>

65
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:18,292
<b>That was on it even before I brought
that scrap here.</b>

66
00:05:18,292 --> 00:05:19,293
<b>Get out.</b>

67
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:22,229
<b>I'm sorry. I'm leaving now.</b>

68
00:05:30,695 --> 00:05:31,638
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

69
00:05:36,835 --> 00:05:38,111
<b>Goodness.</b>

70
00:05:38,403 --> 00:05:40,547
<b>I don't know where to start
to resolve this misunderstanding.</b>

71
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:42,883
<b>I wish I could show you
everything in my mind.</b>

72
00:05:42,883 --> 00:05:45,285
<b>We can help you do so.</b>

73
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:53,827
<b>Sang Ho.</b>

74
00:05:55,031 --> 00:05:56,508
<b>Chairman Baek.</b>

75
00:05:58,766 --> 00:06:01,001
<b>Chairman Baek Sang Ho.</b>

76
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:02,970
<b>That's nice to hear.</b>

77
00:06:04,484 --> 00:06:06,344
<b>You should live long...</b>

78
00:06:06,345 --> 00:06:08,842
<b>so that I can hear that longer.</b>

79
00:06:08,843 --> 00:06:11,345
<b>I was going to tell you
at the right time.</b>

80
00:06:11,578 --> 00:06:13,847
<b>Ki Ho said he had something
to get back from a boy,</b>

81
00:06:13,981 --> 00:06:16,817
<b>so I just waited until he gets it.</b>

82
00:06:16,818 --> 00:06:18,519
<b>Do you know what it was
that he needed to get back?</b>

83
00:06:19,031 --> 00:06:20,087
<b>Well...</b>

84
00:06:20,758 --> 00:06:23,824
<b>I thought he'd keep his my shut
if I'd been too nosy.</b>

85
00:06:26,602 --> 00:06:27,683
<b>Darn it.</b>

86
00:06:30,734 --> 00:06:33,066
<b>Sorry, I interrupted you.</b>

87
00:06:34,539 --> 00:06:35,802
<b>I have to lift my head...</b>

88
00:06:36,495 --> 00:06:39,394
<b>to talk to you, and you know,</b>

89
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:42,809
<b>my neck hurts.</b>

90
00:06:50,851 --> 00:06:52,753
<b>This is way better now.</b>

91
00:06:54,221 --> 00:06:56,867
<b>I like this place.</b>

92
00:06:56,867 --> 00:06:58,559
<b>There's nothing around here,</b>

93
00:06:59,193 --> 00:07:01,673
<b>so no one would know
what happens here, right?</b>

94
00:07:17,156 --> 00:07:19,880
<b>I've had wrong thoughts
about you so far.</b>

95
00:07:21,516 --> 00:07:24,117
<b>If I'd known what kind person
you are,</b>

96
00:07:24,753 --> 00:07:27,955
<b>I wouldn't have used petty tricks
for that chicken feed.</b>

97
00:07:28,622 --> 00:07:30,090
<b>What you need isn't just Ki Ho.</b>

98
00:07:30,424 --> 00:07:32,242
<b>You need what the boy has.</b>

99
00:07:32,365 --> 00:07:35,696
<b>But only Ki Ho knows what it is.</b>

100
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,131
<b>Am I wrong?</b>

101
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:42,035
<b>- Go on.
- I'm offering you a deal.</b>

102
00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:46,974
<b>I'll talk Ki Ho into saying
what the boy is keeping.</b>

103
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,254
<b>Drink it.</b>

104
00:08:02,687 --> 00:08:04,953
<b>You've lost this much water
already while crying.</b>

105
00:08:12,398 --> 00:08:15,076
<b>I'm sorry but I need you
to check something for me.</b>

106
00:08:15,869 --> 00:08:18,805
<b>- What is it?
- I'll show you some photos.</b>

107
00:08:19,573 --> 00:08:22,042
<b>Just tell me if you recognize
anyone from the photos.</b>

108
00:08:23,176 --> 00:08:24,244
<b>Will it be all right?</b>

109
00:08:25,703 --> 00:08:26,379
<b>Yes.</b>

110
00:08:35,255 --> 00:08:36,289
<b>I don't know him.</b>

111
00:08:44,698 --> 00:08:45,832
<b>I don't know this guy.</b>

112
00:08:48,884 --> 00:08:50,637
<b>It's late. Let's go home.</b>

113
00:08:51,492 --> 00:08:52,539
<b>These guys...</b>

114
00:08:54,507 --> 00:08:56,209
<b>You showed the photos
because of Dae Hoon, right?</b>

115
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:58,612
<b>Did he do wrongdoings with them?</b>

116
00:08:59,112 --> 00:09:02,883
<b>I don't know yet. I'm checking
all the possibilities.</b>

117
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:05,117
<b>I know Dae Hoon isn't a good guy.</b>

118
00:09:05,886 --> 00:09:06,953
<b>Still,</b>

119
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:10,290
<b>he has sympathized with me
and been nice to me.</b>

120
00:09:10,935 --> 00:09:12,656
<b>He was the only one...</b>

121
00:09:13,984 --> 00:09:15,529
<b>that I didn't have to pretend
to be fine.</b>

122
00:09:19,469 --> 00:09:20,467
<b>Did he know...</b>

123
00:09:21,034 --> 00:09:23,737
<b>that you habitually hurt yourself?</b>

124
00:09:24,867 --> 00:09:25,639
<b>Yes.</b>

125
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,741
<b>Did you know
about his night blindness?</b>

126
00:09:30,483 --> 00:09:33,080
<b>There are too many light sensors
in his place.</b>

127
00:09:33,647 --> 00:09:35,277
<b>I also checked his medical record.</b>

128
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:40,008
<b>You two really knew
almost everything about each other.</b>

129
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:43,623
<b>I also thought...</b>

130
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,547
<b>I knew everything about Eun Ho.</b>

131
00:09:50,664 --> 00:09:51,665
<b>I'll come back again.</b>

132
00:09:56,369 --> 00:09:58,939
<b>We should see often,
and call me anytime.</b>

133
00:09:59,072 --> 00:10:00,474
<b>Make sure you don't ignore my calls.</b>

134
00:10:00,874 --> 00:10:02,742
<b>Okay. Bye.</b>

135
00:10:14,445 --> 00:10:16,389
<b>(Mr. Lee Sun Woo)</b>

136
00:10:21,133 --> 00:10:22,462
<b>Min Sung.</b>

137
00:10:23,594 --> 00:10:24,664
<b>Dong Myung.</b>

138
00:10:25,922 --> 00:10:27,000
<b>Why did you do it?</b>

139
00:10:39,109 --> 00:10:40,146
<b>Dong Myung.</b>

140
00:10:41,554 --> 00:10:43,183
<b>I was on the phone
with Eun Ho's mother,</b>

141
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:45,252
<b>and I've been waiting
after I heard you were here.</b>

142
00:10:45,986 --> 00:10:47,153
<b>How did you get hurt?</b>

143
00:10:49,031 --> 00:10:52,025
<b>I tripped myself hard this time.</b>

144
00:10:52,492 --> 00:10:54,528
<b>Why didn't you take my call?</b>

145
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,063
<b>I had a lot to think about.</b>

146
00:10:58,711 --> 00:10:59,733
<b>You're a hypocrite.</b>

147
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:03,128
<b>I told you to stop bothering me
and stop worrying about it.</b>

148
00:11:03,503 --> 00:11:04,504
<b>But...</b>

149
00:11:04,738 --> 00:11:07,140
<b>you ignored me, kept poking me,</b>

150
00:11:07,141 --> 00:11:08,575
<b>and threw me off guard.</b>

151
00:11:08,675 --> 00:11:11,430
<b>When he said one lie,
the first thing you said to me was,</b>

152
00:11:13,486 --> 00:11:14,581
<b>"Why did you do it?"</b>

153
00:11:15,194 --> 00:11:18,445
<b>Before you asked me
if I really did it,</b>

154
00:11:20,797 --> 00:11:21,988
<b>you said: "Why did you do it?"</b>

155
00:11:23,632 --> 00:11:24,686
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

<b>Hello?</b>

159
00:12:24,555 --> 00:12:25,618
<b>Yes.</b>

160

<b>Are you on your way home?</b>

161
00:12:27,726 --> 00:12:29,923
<b>- Yes.
- Go straight home.</b>

162

- I'm hanging up.</b>

164

<b>I'll get going.</b>

165
00:12:42,103 --> 00:12:43,706
<b>Are you going

166

<b>I'll take you there.</b>

167

<b>No thanks.</b>

168

<b>Min Sung said that he hurt himself.</b>

<b>I'll fill you in on the way.</b>

170

<b>Let's go.</b>

171

<b>(Chairman Baek Sang Ho,
Manager Oh Doo Seok)</b>

172
00:13:11,798 --> 00:13:14,570
<b>Did he tell you why he did it

173
00:13:14,901 --> 00:13:16,086
<b>Not yet.</b>

174
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:18,071
<b>His chauffeur is the perpetrator,
right?</b>

175
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:20,023
<b>They're still investigating that
too.</b>

176
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:21,539
<b>He is.</b>

177
00:13:22,421 --> 00:13:24,444
<b>That's why Min Sung went all crazy.</b>

178
00:13:26,754 --> 00:13:27,778
<b>Dong Myung.</b>

179
00:13:28,367 --> 00:13:30,547
<b>About Min Sung's chauffeur...</b>

180
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:34,721
<b>What?</b>

181
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,820
<b>He's dead.</b>

182
00:13:40,384 --> 00:13:41,795
<b>How?</b>

183
00:13:42,999 --> 00:13:46,933
<b>Kevin Jung killed Choi Dae Hoon.</b>

<b>I don't have the details yet.</b>

<b>And...</b>

187
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,328
<b>I'm sorry,</b>

188
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,537
<b>but I can't tell you even if I did.</b>

189
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:04,914
<b>I told Min Sung
to beware of his chauffeur.</b>

190
00:14:05,709 --> 00:14:07,020
<b>I told him that he's bad.</b>

191
00:14:08,172 --> 00:14:09,255
<b>You didn't know.</b>

192
00:14:09,522 --> 00:14:10,790
<b>Even if he's dead,</b>

193
00:14:11,572 --> 00:14:13,572
<b>he's still a bad person.</b>

194
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:15,228
<b>Min Sung is...</b>

195
00:14:16,187 --> 00:14:17,330
<b>also a bad person.</b>

196
00:14:17,527 --> 00:14:18,598
<b>Though he's bad,</b>

197
00:14:19,945 --> 00:14:21,668
<b>since someone close to him died,</b>

198
00:14:23,172 --> 00:14:26,506
<b>it must have been sad
and hard for him.</b>

199
00:14:34,016 --> 00:14:36,383
<b>I was in the same class with Eun Ho
in second year in elementary school.</b>

200
00:14:40,898 --> 00:14:42,155
<b>But it's so delicious.</b>

201
00:14:42,457 --> 00:14:44,403
<b>- And?
- I feel bad about the people...</b>

202
00:14:44,428 --> 00:14:46,153
<b>- who can't eat it.
- Like who?</b>

203
00:14:46,711 --> 00:14:48,094
<b>One of my classmates.</b>

204
00:14:49,829 --> 00:14:52,265
<b>You shouldn't have brought it up
if you weren't going to tell me.</b>

205
00:14:52,305 --> 00:14:53,900
<b>It was a long time ago.</b>

206
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,220
<b>I was very little at the time.</b>

207
00:14:56,221 --> 00:14:57,976
<b>- It sounds fun.
- Forget it.</b>

208
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:01,434
<b>Gosh.</b>

209
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,643
<b>So...</b>

210
00:15:04,511 --> 00:15:07,013
<b>we were in the same class
in second year in elementary school.</b>

211
00:15:07,247 --> 00:15:09,649
<b>He asked me why I didn't have
a father.</b>

212
00:15:10,757 --> 00:15:11,937
<b>So I told him:</b>

213
00:15:13,553 --> 00:15:15,055
<b>"He died because he had
too many shrimps."</b>

214
00:15:15,321 --> 00:15:17,090
<b>Did you know your friend was
allergic to shrimp?</b>

215
00:15:17,091 --> 00:15:18,691
<b>That's why I said that to him.</b>

216
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:20,827
<b>That's so mean.</b>

217
00:15:22,012 --> 00:15:23,163
<b>What did he say?</b>

218
00:15:24,204 --> 00:15:25,498
<b>He kept crying.</b>

219
00:15:26,937 --> 00:15:28,268
<b>So I told him that my father died...</b>

220
00:15:28,668 --> 00:15:30,537
<b>because he was too full
after eating all the shrimps.</b>

221
00:15:30,925 --> 00:15:33,706
<b>He started following me since then,
so I hung out with him.</b>

222
00:15:34,203 --> 00:15:36,367
<b>Then he started ignoring me
overnight.</b>

223
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:39,820
<b>His mother told him not to hang out
with poor friends.</b>

224
00:15:41,019 --> 00:15:42,549
<b>I was a poor boy with no father.</b>

225
00:15:44,508 --> 00:15:45,576
<b>Does he...</b>

226
00:15:46,219 --> 00:15:48,087
<b>still ignore you?</b>

227
00:15:48,162 --> 00:15:49,622
<b>I met his eyes,</b>

228
00:15:50,273 --> 00:15:52,892
<b>and I ignored him
when he waved at me.</b>

229
00:15:53,359 --> 00:15:54,427
<b>Well done.</b>

230
00:16:02,476 --> 00:16:04,476
<b>Min Sung,
are you allergic to shrimp?</b>

231
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:09,442
<b>- How did you know?
- Eun Ho once told me about you.</b>

232
00:16:10,242 --> 00:16:12,445
<b>I should have asked him your name.</b>

233
00:16:13,046 --> 00:16:14,247
<b>I sent...</b>

234
00:16:15,312 --> 00:16:17,650
<b>the answers for the midterm exam
to his cell phone.</b>

235
00:16:18,451 --> 00:16:19,853
<b>I didn't tell him they were
for the midterm exam, though.</b>

236
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,688
<b>I wanted to be friends with him
again.</b>

237
00:16:22,344 --> 00:16:24,557
<b>My grades went up, but he said...</b>

238
00:16:25,656 --> 00:16:28,294
<b>that he couldn't write the answers
because he already knew.</b>

239
00:16:28,295 --> 00:16:30,029
<b>Did Eun Ho tell you to confess?</b>

240
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,464
<b>I begged him,</b>

241
00:16:32,304 --> 00:16:33,782
<b>but he wasn't going to let it go.</b>

242
00:16:34,667 --> 00:16:37,303
<b>He said that he'd tell the school
if I didn't.</b>

243
00:16:37,304 --> 00:16:39,739
<b>So that's what you meant when you
said he gave you a hard time.</b>

244
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:40,840
<b>Yes.</b>

245
00:16:41,258 --> 00:16:42,275
<b>My mother...</b>

246
00:16:44,648 --> 00:16:45,812
<b>is going to prison, right?</b>

247
00:16:46,779 --> 00:16:47,947
<b>Maybe.</b>

248
00:16:49,195 --> 00:16:51,551
<b>But you shouldn't blame yourself.</b>

249
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:54,287
<b>You're only responsible
for your own wrongdoing.</b>

250
00:16:55,922 --> 00:16:58,758
<b>Was Dae Hoon ever
going after Eun Ho's bag?</b>

251
00:16:59,259 --> 00:17:01,027
<b>To destroy evidence on his phone.</b>

252
00:17:01,342 --> 00:17:03,763
<b>I've never thought about that.</b>

253
00:17:05,414 --> 00:17:07,567
<b>But someone must have opened
Eun Ho's locker.</b>

254
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:14,807
<b>Do you know who it was?</b>

255
00:17:17,777 --> 00:17:19,245
<b>But I saw a man.</b>

256
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,271
<b>Here at the Shinsung Middle School,</b>

257
00:17:22,462 --> 00:17:25,618
<b>I've seen light and darkness today.</b>

258
00:17:27,226 --> 00:17:31,224
<b>Everyone, do you know what
differentiates humans from animals?</b>

259
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:39,932
<b>After that,</b>

260
00:17:40,484 --> 00:17:43,136
<b>Eun Ho asked me
if I had opened his locker.</b>

261
00:17:43,336 --> 00:17:45,238
<b>Was it one of the guys
in the photos earlier?</b>

262
00:17:45,658 --> 00:17:47,173
<b>Then I would have said
I've seen them.</b>

263
00:17:47,874 --> 00:17:49,676
<b>If we find this man,</b>

264
00:17:50,251 --> 00:17:51,811
<b>will you be able to verify it?</b>

265
00:17:52,314 --> 00:17:54,247
<b>- Yes.
- Thank you.</b>

266
00:17:56,218 --> 00:17:59,752
<b>The things you told me today are
a great help.</b>

267

<b>- Really?
- Yes.</b>

268

<b>You can talk to me about anything.</b>

272

<b>- Okay.
- We should go.</b>

<b>"they have done."</b>

312
00:20:45,885 --> 00:20:48,254
<b>Ki Ho promised that he'd reward me.</b>

313
00:20:48,488 --> 00:20:51,023
<b>Then he asked me to find a boy...</b>

314
00:20:51,491 --> 00:20:52,859
<b>named Eun Ho.</b>

315
00:20:53,159 --> 00:20:55,828
<b>It means I'm the only one...</b>

316
00:20:55,829 --> 00:20:57,663
<b>he can rely on right now.</b>

317
00:20:57,664 --> 00:21:00,967
<b>I don't trust people.
I trust what they have...</b>

319

<b>This whole time,</b>

320
00:21:08,843 --> 00:21:11,143
<b>I've been so wrong about you.</b>

321
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:14,113
<b>I had no idea...</b>

322
00:21:14,747 --> 00:21:16,916
<b>you were this gutsy.</b>

323
00:21:17,891 --> 00:21:19,652
<b>Let me get this straight.</b>

324
00:21:20,586 --> 00:21:21,487
<b>So...</b>

325
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:26,325
<b>even when your life is at risk,</b>

326

<b>you're running that tongue of yours.</b>

327
00:21:44,776 --> 00:21:46,879
<b>This is me, Ki Ho.</b>

328
00:21:49,491 --> 00:21:51,484
<b>Hello?</b>

329
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,228
<b>Is that you, Ki Ho?</b>

330
00:22:02,562 --> 00:22:04,230
<b>- Yes.
- Where are you?</b>

331
00:22:04,231 --> 00:22:06,532
<b>I was startled
because you weren't here.</b>

332
00:22:07,066 --> 00:22:09,835
<b>Well, I had something to check.</b>

333
00:22:09,836 --> 00:22:12,004
<b>Stay there. I'll go get you.</b>

334
00:22:18,186 --> 00:22:20,079
<b>If I can't cut your hands off,</b>

335
00:22:20,346 --> 00:22:22,114
<b>I guess I'll have to join hands

336
00:22:24,694 --> 00:22:25,551
<b>Look.</b>

337
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:28,754
<b>If I tell you

00:22:37,619 --> 00:22:39,465
<b>- I'm listening.
- Well,</b>

341
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:42,001
<b>you said you liked this place.</b>

342
00:22:42,692 --> 00:22:45,605
<b>Buy it at a price 20 times higher
than the market value.</b>

343
00:22:52,445 --> 00:22:54,814
<b>- Ki Ho is waiting.
- Fine.</b>

344
00:22:55,719 --> 00:22:57,083
<b>I'll buy this place.</b>

346

<b>Was he also like that in the past?</b>

347
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,031
<b>I thought he was
just a foolish geezer,</b>

348
00:23:12,446 --> 00:23:14,734
<b>but it's like he was raising
dozens of snakes in his stomach.</b>

<b>Are you really going
to buy this place?</b>

350
00:23:19,387 --> 00:23:21,941
<b>- It's useless.
- Why is it useless?</b>

351
00:23:22,308 --> 00:23:23,809
<b>It's not bad as a graveyard.</b>

352
00:23:23,871 --> 00:23:25,478
<b>Good thinking, Doo Seok.</b>

353

<b>Let's bury him

354
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:31,617
<b>Okay.</b>

355
00:23:31,918 --> 00:23:33,886
<b>Not bad, Doo Seok.</b>

356

<b>(Senior Inspector Cha Young Jin)</b>

357
00:23:51,694 --> 00:23:53,773
<b>Someone must have opened
Eun Ho's locker.</b>

358
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,789
<b>He didn't take anything out.
He put something in.</b>

359
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:18,130
<b>What did Jang Ki Ho give to Eun Ho?</b>

360

<b>You're here.</b>

361
00:24:28,224 --> 00:24:30,476
<b>I've been so busy.</b>

362
00:24:31,382 --> 00:24:32,445
<b>How did you like Dong Myung?</b>

363
00:24:33,891 --> 00:24:36,082
<b>- He's cute.
- Like you in the past?</b>

364
00:24:36,449 --> 00:24:39,552
<b>When I met you, I was 18.</b>

365
00:24:39,553 --> 00:24:41,587
<b>Look at you.</b>

366
00:24:41,954 --> 00:24:44,757
<b>Then again,
a three-year age difference...</b>

367
00:24:44,966 --> 00:24:47,094
<b>is huge for kids around that age.</b>

368
00:24:49,476 --> 00:24:51,163
<b>And I've become...</b>

369
00:24:52,609 --> 00:24:55,201
<b>a totally different person
from that time too.</b>

370
00:24:57,187 --> 00:24:58,137
<b>Let's sit down.</b>

371
00:25:00,754 --> 00:25:02,808
<b>Take out the voice recorder.</b>

00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,335
<b>It's not here.</b>

376
00:25:34,707 --> 00:25:35,641
<b>Move.</b>

377
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:51,824
<b>What happened?</b>

378
00:25:53,023 --> 00:25:55,361
<b>Was there any time
Dong Myung was here alone?</b>

379
00:25:56,109 --> 00:25:56,996
<b>No.</b>

380
00:26:03,226 --> 00:26:04,103
<b>Wait.</b>

381
00:26:08,035 --> 00:26:10,042
<b>Yes, what is it?</b>

382
00:26:16,156 --> 00:26:19,451
<b>Ki Ho went to see Eun Ho today.</b>

383
00:26:23,633 --> 00:26:24,456
<b>I see.</b>

384
00:26:25,242 --> 00:26:26,859
<b>Please keep up the good work.</b>

385
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,967
<b>Forget about the recorder.</b>

386
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:35,901
<b>Sit down.</b>

387
00:26:36,902 --> 00:26:39,638
<b>Isn't it suffocating
to stay in this room?</b>

388
00:26:40,875 --> 00:26:42,475
<b>It's better than the beginning.</b>

389
00:26:42,708 --> 00:26:45,110
<b>- I've gotten attached to him too.
- As expected.</b>

390

<b>I guess having had you
guard Eun Ho was the right choice.</b>

<b>Well, are Dong Myung and Eun Ho...</b>

392

<b>- in the same class?
- I don't think so. Why do you ask?</b>

<b>- It's nothing.
- You silly.</b>

394

<b>I guess Mr. Baek is inside.</b>

<b>That's right.</b>

396

<b>Are you always with him?</b>

397
00:27:19,484 --> 00:27:21,614
<b>- Mostly, I am.
- What is your name?</b>

<b>(Manager Oh Doo Seok)</b>

<b>to Shinsung Middle School to present
a good conduct award, didn't he?</b>

401
00:27:38,105 --> 00:27:41,066
<b>- That's right.
- I'm sure you were with him.</b>

402
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,568
<b>Right.</b>

403
00:27:44,637 --> 00:27:46,138
<b>I see you aren't curious...</b>

404
00:27:46,749 --> 00:27:48,234
<b>about why I'm asking you
these questions.</b>

405
00:27:49,616 --> 00:27:51,616
<b>I rarely do anything useless.</b>

406
00:27:52,616 --> 00:27:54,313
<b>I know you won't tell me
even if I ask.</b>

407

<b>My gosh, we've run into each other
twice a day in this wide world.</b>

408
00:28:04,524 --> 00:28:06,992
<b>- Will you give me some time?
- Sure.</b>

409
00:28:07,193 --> 00:28:09,828
<b>- Mr. Oh, you can leave first.
- Just a moment is enough.</b>

410
00:28:10,162 --> 00:28:12,398
<b>Just go home and rest.</b>

411
00:28:13,732 --> 00:28:15,301
<b>- See you again.
- Goodbye.</b>

412
00:28:29,828 --> 00:28:31,317
<b>This afternoon, you asked me...</b>

<b>which one I'd choose if I had to.</b>

414
00:28:36,125 --> 00:28:38,924
<b>Oh, the drug dealing?
Did you find the culprits?</b>

415
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:42,309
<b>And you said you desired
for salvation instead of justice.</b>

416
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:44,196
<b>Which side is justice?</b>

417
00:28:44,964 --> 00:28:46,136
<b>And which side is salvation?</b>

418
00:28:46,161 --> 00:28:49,001
<b>Gosh, you got me wrong.</b>

419
00:28:49,168 --> 00:28:50,703
<b>An act of choosing itself...</b>

420
00:28:50,907 --> 00:28:53,639
<b>is salvation.</b>

421
00:28:53,884 --> 00:28:55,941
<b>You didn't choose.</b>

422
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:57,743
<b>Justice would...</b>

423
00:28:57,744 --> 00:29:01,680
<b>punish them both, but salvation
would give them a chance...</b>

424
00:29:01,681 --> 00:29:03,415
<b>without telling good from evil.</b>

425
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:05,851
<b>I mean,</b>

426
00:29:06,157 --> 00:29:09,788
<b>I heard they were both missing,
which gave me a bad omen.</b>

427
00:29:09,796 --> 00:29:13,555
<b>I wished at least
one of them would be alive.</b>

428
00:29:13,555 --> 00:29:14,927
<b>I babbled on...</b>

429

<b>with that in mind.</b>

430

<b>I didn't know you'd be

<b>Didn't you go to New Life Church

<b>Whatever the case is,

<b>They've devoted all their lives

<b>Why do you ask about them two?</b>

437

<b>It's our job...</b>

438

<b>to ask and listen

439
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:52,131
<b>That's right. But whatever you ask,</b>

440

<b>ask Chairman Yoon Hee Seob... No.</b>

441

<b>It should be faster to ask Sun Woo.</b>

<b>Wait.</b>

445

<b>Did you not know?</b>

446
00:30:09,882 --> 00:30:10,949
<b>You didn't know...</b>

<b>Sun Woo is the actual heir

<b>Gosh, what do I do?</b>

449
00:30:19,725 --> 00:30:21,260
<b>I made a mistake.</b>

450
00:31:01,238 --> 00:31:02,467
<b>You scared me!</b>

451
00:31:04,308 --> 00:31:05,182
<b>It hurts.</b>

452
00:31:05,304 --> 00:31:06,738
<b>What are you doing in here?</b>

453

<b>Gosh. You gave me a fright.</b>

455

<b>What's wrong with you?</b>

456
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:20,939
<b>What happened to your face?</b>

457
00:31:25,376 --> 00:31:30,129
<b>I got into a fight with a drunkard

<b>But he was taken away by the police.</b>

459
00:31:33,066 --> 00:31:34,500
<b>Seriously.</b>

460
00:31:34,501 --> 00:31:37,658
<b>You learned taekwondo

<b>Aren't you going to use that?</b>

462
00:31:38,738 --> 00:31:41,874
<b>How can I use that?
The other person will get hurt.</b>

463
00:31:42,423 --> 00:31:46,345
<b>Don't hit them. Get punched

<b>Under Kevin's directions,

<b>- What do you think?

<b>Why did they get in a fight?
What were they talking about?</b>

00:41:26,287 --> 00:41:28,331
<b>He was a bit unstable.</b>

591

<b>Apart from that, he's lying.</b>

592

<b>You said Dae Hoon drove

<b>He already admitted his crime

597

<b>Why would he lie about that?</b>

598
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:46,675
<b>First of all, he doesn't know
that Dae Hoon had night blindness.</b>

599
00:41:46,676 --> 00:41:49,117
<b>Secondly, there could have been
another accomplice.</b>

600
00:41:49,541 --> 00:41:51,149
<b>When he said he met the demon,</b>

601
00:41:51,593 --> 00:41:55,044
<b>he could have meant the person
behind it, not because he was high.</b>

<b>This is getting more interesting.</b>

<b>- Team One will take care of it.

<b>- What about Hee Jung's funds?
- We're still waiting for a warrant.</b>

607
00:42:08,122 --> 00:42:10,257
<b>Even when we have the warrant,

<b>to check all her accounts.
We need more teams on this.</b>

609
00:42:13,203 --> 00:42:15,017
<b>- I'll call for backup.
- Yes.</b>

610
00:42:16,141 --> 00:42:17,425
<b>And...</b>

611
00:42:18,615 --> 00:42:19,989
<b>Can I speak first?</b>

612
00:42:20,574 --> 00:42:22,275
<b>- Yes.
- You've gotten nicer.</b>

613

00:42:33,832 --> 00:42:34,886
<b>How much?</b>

618
00:42:35,104 --> 00:42:36,656
<b>A total of 15 million dollars.</b>

619
00:42:37,597 --> 00:42:40,483
<b>Where did she get all this money?</b>

620
00:42:41,253 --> 00:42:42,980
<b>Is this also from the church?</b>

621
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:45,217
<b>If an unregistered investor dies,</b>

- It'll be troublesome.</b>

623
00:42:48,011 --> 00:42:49,354
<b>How did you find out about this?</b>

624
00:42:49,863 --> 00:42:52,409
<b>I could have bought a house
with the money I paid...</b>

<b>- to treat my sources.
- You're still arrogant.</b>

626
00:42:55,901 --> 00:42:58,589
<b>Find the source of the 15 million
dollars when you get the warrant.</b>

627
00:42:58,590 --> 00:42:59,663
<b>Okay.</b>

628
00:42:59,897 --> 00:43:02,731
<b>I found a lead
from Min Sung last night.</b>

629
00:43:03,933 --> 00:43:05,775
<b>On the day Eun Ho received
the good conduct award,</b>

630
00:43:06,323 --> 00:43:08,629
<b>he saw a young man
walking down an empty hallway.</b>

631
00:43:09,169 --> 00:43:13,008
<b>After that, Eun Ho asked him
if he'd opened Eun Ho's locker.</b>

632
00:43:14,472 --> 00:43:16,215
<b>He's still asleep.</b>

633
00:43:16,495 --> 00:43:19,858
<b>- Doo Seok, how long are you...
- Just leave him.</b>

634
00:43:19,941 --> 00:43:22,357
<b>Why? Is he sick?</b>

635
00:43:22,357 --> 00:43:25,649
<b>He's been busy day and night
in the last few days.</b>

636
00:43:25,656 --> 00:43:28,340
<b>- He must be tired.
- What?</b>

637
00:43:28,627 --> 00:43:30,263
<b>Say it so that I can understand.</b>

638
00:43:30,292 --> 00:43:32,702
<b>It means I worked hard
thanks to someone.</b>

639
00:43:32,702 --> 00:43:34,219
<b>Thanks to whom? What kind of...</b>

640
00:43:35,261 --> 00:43:37,723
<b>- Me?
- You have quick wits.</b>

641
00:43:37,723 --> 00:43:39,303
<b>- What did I do?
- You have the body...</b>

642
00:43:39,328 --> 00:43:41,904
<b>that leaves a strong impression

643
00:43:42,043 --> 00:43:44,039
<b>And I have to do all your work.</b>

644

<b>Doo Seok.</b>

645
00:43:51,864 --> 00:43:53,535
<b>When you speak so kindly to me,</b>

646
00:43:53,621 --> 00:43:56,195
<b>I feel like I could give you
my liver and gall bladder.</b>

647

<b>I don't need

648

<b>When you die,

649

<b>It looks so healthy.</b>

650
00:44:04,621 --> 00:44:07,097
<b>You look thin and pale.

<b>You're okay, right?</b>

653
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:21,444
<b>Sure.</b>

654
00:44:21,988 --> 00:44:23,418
<b>Sang Ho said

655

<b>so that I can use it

<b>I have no idea how they all

<b>Can't we just be honest with them?</b>

<b>That's the problem. We can't.</b>

<b>How would he be able to bear

<b>Kids think Dong Myung is accused

<b>And Min Sung...</b>

<b>Yes, roughly.</b>

<b>Where is he?</b>

682

<b>Have you heard about the source

<b>It's Chairman Baek as far as I know.</b>

702

<b>Does that give him the right

<b>Are you also remaining silent?</b>

741

<b>Do you think something happened

<b>You'll feel safer

<b>Then you'll want to tell them

<b>The chairman is certain

<b>We don't care about those kind

<b>I'm the victim

770
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:35,861
<b>- Right.
- Well,</b>

771
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:39,419
<b>I guess the assault against me
isn't that important to you.</b>

772
00:51:39,899 --> 00:51:42,638
<b>I'm sorry. I'll get back to you
as soon as possible.</b>

773
00:51:43,017 --> 00:51:44,756
<b>Do you suddenly feel uncomfortable
around me?</b>

774
00:51:46,681 --> 00:51:47,883
<b>Why do you think so?</b>

775
00:51:47,883 --> 00:51:49,122
<b>This is the first time...</b>

776
00:51:49,146 --> 00:51:51,802
<b>you came to school
without calling me beforehand.</b>

777
00:51:52,869 --> 00:51:53,712
<b>Is that right?</b>

778
00:51:53,878 --> 00:51:55,732
<b>Should I've told you sooner...</b>

779
00:51:56,775 --> 00:51:58,788
<b>that my brother-in-law is
the chairman of this school?</b>

780
00:51:59,525 --> 00:52:02,067
<b>Are you assuming
that I hid it on purpose...</b>

781
00:52:02,416 --> 00:52:04,307
<b>and followed you around?</b>

782
00:52:04,884 --> 00:52:08,812
<b>I don't, but it's better we behave
more carefully from now on.</b>

783
00:52:10,235 --> 00:52:11,410
<b>I'll call you later.</b>

784
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:18,161
<b>Did you find Min Sung's weakness
that only Eun Ho might've known?</b>

785

<b>Did you...</b>

786

<b>find out about Min Sung's secret?</b>

787

<b>You're answering my question

788

<b>I think...</b>

789
00:52:33,798 --> 00:52:35,458
<b>I've missed the chance.</b>

790

<b>Dong Myung, when are you coming?</b>

797
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:48,907
<b>Put Mr. Hwang on the phone.</b>

798
00:53:48,961 --> 00:53:50,675
<b>Mr. Hwang, he wants to talk to you.</b>

799

<b>Dong Myung!</b>

<b>Joo Han Sol, come down there.</b>

803

<b>I want to stay a little longer.</b>

804

<b>Come down!</b>

805
00:54:10,906 --> 00:54:13,590
<b>Why would you yell
at a sick kid?</b>

806
00:54:13,621 --> 00:54:15,080
<b>I'm sick too.</b>

807
00:54:15,416 --> 00:54:18,437
<b>I'm rotting inside.</b>

808
00:54:18,882 --> 00:54:20,512
<b>Because of that punk,</b>

809
00:54:21,299 --> 00:54:23,316
<b>I might be forced to transfer.</b>

810

<b>Why?</b>

811
00:54:24,127 --> 00:54:26,023
<b>I don't know.</b>

812
00:54:26,298 --> 00:54:27,930
<b>Why me, not you?</b>

813
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:29,892
<b>How could you...</b>

<b>bring my brother here?</b>

815
00:54:33,449 --> 00:54:35,710
<b>We met at the convenience store.</b>

816
00:54:35,710 --> 00:54:39,531
<b>He bought me ice cream,
and I asked if I could come here.</b>

817
00:54:44,283 --> 00:54:45,276
<b>All right.</b>

818
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:47,493
<b>Have it your way, then.</b>

819
00:54:54,963 --> 00:54:55,786
<b>Let go...</b>

<b>- if you don't want a beating.
- You said you quit being a thug.</b>

821

<b>Why must you transfer because of me?</b>

822

<b>If I tell you,</b>

- I...</b>

<b>I'm going to tell the school.</b>

826
00:55:14,345 --> 00:55:15,835
<b>Was Eun Ho aware of this?</b>

827
00:55:17,619 --> 00:55:18,672
<b>Do you want to come in?</b>

828
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:26,451
<b>Do you have snacks?</b>

<b>Let's continue with the meeting.</b>

833

<b>Joo Dong Myung is
killing me, seriously.</b>

834
00:55:51,174 --> 00:55:52,838
<b>I should submit a leave of absence
or something.</b>

835
00:55:58,791 --> 00:56:00,376
<b>I'll be in charge of Dong Myung.</b>

836
00:56:01,907 --> 00:56:03,044
<b>I'm requesting...</b>

837
00:56:03,581 --> 00:56:05,695
<b>that he moves to my class.</b>

838
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:08,064
<b>We're considering the school
transfer option at the moment...</b>

839
00:56:08,065 --> 00:56:10,657
<b>Why must he be transferred
when he did nothing wrong?</b>

840
00:56:10,658 --> 00:56:12,656
<b>Mr. Lee! Keep your voice down.</b>

841
00:56:13,377 --> 00:56:15,922
<b>It's true what happened
to Min Sung is unfortunate,</b>

842
00:56:16,392 --> 00:56:18,713
<b>but Dong Myung shouldn't
be punished for this.</b>

843
00:56:21,939 --> 00:56:25,235
<b>Min Sung and Dong Myung's picture is
up on the online school noticeboard.</b>

844
00:56:25,235 --> 00:56:28,543
<b>- What do you mean?
- Min Sung wrote a posting.</b>

845
00:56:35,492 --> 00:56:37,142
<b>(Min Sung would've smashed
the wall in the science room...)</b>

<b>Hello, Mr. Hwang.</b>

849
00:56:55,705 --> 00:56:57,026
<b>Did you see the noticeboard?</b>

850
00:56:57,274 --> 00:56:59,596
<b>Dong Myung didn't make a smile
any bigger than that.</b>

851
00:57:01,603 --> 00:57:02,912
<b>Was that you?</b>

852
00:57:02,959 --> 00:57:05,767
<b>No, it was Min Sung's idea.
I only persuaded Dong Myung.</b>

853
00:57:05,939 --> 00:57:07,608
<b>I wonder if it'll be effective.</b>

854
00:57:07,712 --> 00:57:08,816
<b>Of course.</b>

855
00:57:09,455 --> 00:57:11,523
<b>Kids are way better than grownups.</b>

856
00:57:14,877 --> 00:57:18,949
<b>Tell Dong Myung
that he's in my class from today on,</b>

857
00:57:19,524 --> 00:57:22,537
<b>and he can no longer cut school.</b>

858
00:57:23,070 --> 00:57:23,986
<b>Okay.</b>

859
00:57:24,821 --> 00:57:27,895
<b>Did you hear that?
He said it so loud.</b>

860

<b>(Manager Oh Doo Seok)</b>

<b>Mr. Oh?</b>

00:58:01,805 --> 00:58:03,265
<b>Could we meet for a moment?</b>

863
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:13,155
<b>I think it's this man.</b>

864
00:58:13,689 --> 00:58:14,761
<b>Are you sure it's him?</b>

865
00:58:14,862 --> 00:58:16,452
<b>I think he's similar,</b>

866
00:58:17,213 --> 00:58:18,685
<b>but I'm not sure.</b>

867
00:58:21,231 --> 00:58:22,035
<b>I see.</b>

868
00:58:22,658 --> 00:58:24,564
<b>Thank you. You need to rest up now.</b>

869

<b>- Ms. Cha.
- Yes?</b>

870

<b>Dong Myung and I

<b>- Is that possible?
- I don't know.</b>

872
