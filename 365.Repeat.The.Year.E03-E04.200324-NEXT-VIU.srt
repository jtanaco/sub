1
00:00:07,491 --> 00:00:09,937
<b>Mr. Park Young Gil who couldn't make it here today...</b>

2
00:00:13,261 --> 00:00:14,906
<b>is dead.</b>

3
00:00:15,071 --> 00:00:17,947
<b>Pardon? He's dead?</b>

4
00:00:23,811 --> 00:00:27,017
<b>If I reset my life, does it mean I can win the lottery too?</b>

5
00:00:35,722 --> 00:00:39,136
<b>Are you all right? Se Rin. Se Rin! What should we do?</b>

6
00:00:42,891 --> 00:00:44,437
<b>Thank you.</b>

7
00:00:57,372 --> 00:00:58,886
<b>It was...</b>

8
00:00:59,442 --> 00:01:01,411
<b>an unexpected accident.</b>

9
00:01:01,411 --> 00:01:03,657
<b>It was an accident?</b>

10
00:01:04,012 --> 00:01:05,826
<b>Do you all remember...</b>

11
00:01:07,682 --> 00:01:09,397
<b>the moment we reset?</b>

12
00:01:10,352 --> 00:01:14,636
<b>I'm sure all of you blacked out for a moment.</b>

13
00:01:19,102 --> 00:01:20,406
<b>Gosh, that's hot!</b>

14
00:01:24,102 --> 00:01:25,276
<b>Are you okay?</b>

15
00:01:31,042 --> 00:01:32,317
<b>What's wrong?</b>

16
00:01:34,882 --> 00:01:36,682
<b>- That was my lucky moment! - Really?</b>

17
00:01:36,682 --> 00:01:39,397
<b>- What's he doing? - What's your plan?</b>

18
00:01:52,201 --> 00:01:53,831
<b>Goodness. Hey.</b>

19
00:01:53,831 --> 00:01:55,046
<b>Hey.</b>

20
00:01:59,301 --> 00:02:01,686
<b>Hey. Are you all right?</b>

21
00:02:06,242 --> 00:02:08,757
<b>Mr. Park Young Gil was driving at that very moment.</b>

22
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:22,506
<b>He died on the scene.</b>

23
00:02:26,132 --> 00:02:28,406
<b>I was the one who suggested this reset.</b>

24
00:02:29,532 --> 00:02:31,376
<b>So I feel responsible for his death.</b>

25
00:02:32,641 --> 00:02:33,746
<b>If any of you...</b>

26
00:02:34,812 --> 00:02:37,047
<b>encounter any problems regarding this reset...</b>

27
00:02:37,912 --> 00:02:39,387
<b>or need help,</b>

28
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:42,087
<b>feel free to come to me.</b>

29
00:02:42,752 --> 00:02:44,526
<b>I'll do my best...</b>

30
00:02:45,621 --> 00:02:47,096
<b>to help you.</b>

31
00:03:10,111 --> 00:03:11,216
<b>Ma'am.</b>

32
00:03:16,852 --> 00:03:19,096
<b>Goodness.</b>

33
00:03:20,322 --> 00:03:23,767
<b>Shouldn't she have warned us about this?</b>

34
00:03:24,562 --> 00:03:26,566
<b>We could've been in danger as well.</b>

35
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:32,207
<b>Perhaps, she didn't tell us because she didn't know either.</b>

36
00:03:33,562 --> 00:03:34,901
<b>I can't believe this.</b>

37
00:03:34,901 --> 00:03:37,807
<b>He was alive almost a year from today.</b>

38
00:03:39,171 --> 00:03:42,917
<b>But he died during the reset.</b>

39
00:03:43,442 --> 00:03:45,087
<b>His fate must've changed.</b>

40
00:03:50,982 --> 00:03:53,626
<b>Let's not talk about this here.</b>

41
00:03:53,782 --> 00:03:56,397
<b>Let's go somewhere else and chat more.</b>

42
00:04:04,431 --> 00:04:07,032
<b>It's time for my shift soon.</b>

43
00:04:07,032 --> 00:04:08,746
<b>Haven't you quit yet?</b>

44
00:04:09,371 --> 00:04:11,442
<b>- What about the lottery? - I've memorized...</b>

45
00:04:11,442 --> 00:04:12,876
<b>the lottery number for the one with huge prize money.</b>

46
00:04:14,502 --> 00:04:16,487
<b>But I'm going to continue working until they find my replacement.</b>

47
00:04:17,011 --> 00:04:18,186
<b>I can't help it.</b>

48
00:04:23,751 --> 00:04:26,496
<b>Let's go out for some coffee.</b>

49
00:04:31,421 --> 00:04:32,597
<b>Shall we begin?</b>

50
00:04:36,131 --> 00:04:38,206
<b>I found out about something...</b>

51
00:04:39,301 --> 00:04:40,436
<b>that I shouldn't have.</b>

52
00:04:40,631 --> 00:04:42,506
<b>I feel like everything's ruined now.</b>

53
00:04:44,402 --> 00:04:46,646
<b>I thought you'd be the happiest among them...</b>

54
00:04:47,501 --> 00:04:49,086
<b>after the reset.</b>

55
00:04:50,111 --> 00:04:52,086
<b>Seeing you regret this already...</b>

56
00:04:52,482 --> 00:04:53,987
<b>makes me sad.</b>

57
00:04:54,751 --> 00:04:57,126
<b>I only thought I'd dodge all the bad incidents.</b>

58
00:04:57,511 --> 00:04:59,797
<b>I didn't imagine I'd go through something...</b>

59
00:05:00,251 --> 00:05:01,727
<b>this horrible.</b>

60
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:03,967
<b>You still have the memory...</b>

61
00:05:04,392 --> 00:05:06,996
<b>from before the reset.</b>

62
00:05:07,662 --> 00:05:09,807
<b>That's why you can make different decisions.</b>

63
00:05:10,462 --> 00:05:12,936
<b>And living a different life because of those new decisions...</b>

64
00:05:13,631 --> 00:05:15,277
<b>is a given.</b>

65
00:05:23,912 --> 00:05:25,186
<b>Let's go.</b>

66
00:05:25,941 --> 00:05:28,386
<b>- Aren't you Maru? - Maru. I'm so sorry.</b>

67
00:05:29,751 --> 00:05:33,227
<b>Hold on. There you go.</b>

68
00:05:33,881 --> 00:05:35,196
<b>You don't like it.</b>

69
00:05:35,352 --> 00:05:37,566
<b>Right. Oh, no. The vaccinations.</b>

70
00:05:38,361 --> 00:05:39,537
<b>Let's get them tomorrow.</b>

71
00:05:39,962 --> 00:05:41,222
<b>Ga Hyeon will be home soon.</b>

72
00:05:41,222 --> 00:05:43,592
<b>All right. Woo Jin, why are you here at this hour?</b>

73
00:05:43,592 --> 00:05:46,107
<b>I bought some macarons, your favorite.</b>

74
00:05:48,371 --> 00:05:50,076
<b>Woo Jin, why are you here at this hour?</b>

75
00:05:54,001 --> 00:05:55,217
<b>You're right.</b>

76
00:05:56,212 --> 00:05:57,886
<b>I didn't know...</b>

77
00:05:58,111 --> 00:05:59,857
<b>and agreed to reset.</b>

78
00:06:03,051 --> 00:06:05,657
<b>I don't know if I can do this.</b>

79
00:06:06,881 --> 00:06:10,496
<b>I can't get over this feeling of betrayal.</b>

80
00:06:10,751 --> 00:06:13,066
<b>When people experience horrible incidents,</b>

81
00:06:13,691 --> 00:06:17,537
<b>they often go through memory loss.</b>

82
00:06:18,801 --> 00:06:20,836
<b>Your subconscious removes...</b>

83
00:06:21,261 --> 00:06:23,177
<b>any unbearable memories.</b>

84
00:06:24,202 --> 00:06:26,547
<b>But since you still remember them,</b>

85
00:06:26,602 --> 00:06:28,787
<b>doesn't that mean you can take it?</b>

86
00:06:30,371 --> 00:06:33,482
<b>Perhaps, you're a much stronger person...</b>

87
00:06:33,482 --> 00:06:35,456
<b>than you think you are.</b>

88
00:06:36,111 --> 00:06:38,157
<b>Think about why you agreed to do this...</b>

89
00:06:38,181 --> 00:06:40,756
<b>and how you'll use this time granted to you.</b>

90
00:06:41,352 --> 00:06:42,826
<b>Focus on those things.</b>

91
00:06:44,121 --> 00:06:45,936
<b>It'll be more worth it...</b>

92
00:06:46,592 --> 00:06:48,566
<b>than allowing your subconscious to make the decisions.</b>

93
00:07:07,741 --> 00:07:08,956
<b>Thank you.</b>

94
00:07:11,482 --> 00:07:13,256
<b>The vibe here is amazing.</b>

95
00:07:14,582 --> 00:07:17,396
<b>I used to be a regular here.</b>

96
00:07:17,821 --> 00:07:19,936
<b>My wife loved drinking coffee...</b>

97
00:07:20,191 --> 00:07:22,537
<b>and wanted to open one later on in life.</b>

98
00:07:23,431 --> 00:07:26,706
<b>Although I'm an amateur, I do have a barista certificate.</b>

99
00:07:26,931 --> 00:07:29,576
<b>So I was able to buy this place, thanks to the reset.</b>

100
00:07:30,532 --> 00:07:33,816
<b>I'm going to quit work soon and fly to Canada.</b>

101
00:07:33,902 --> 00:07:35,811
<b>This is my second chance. It should be worth it.</b>

102
00:07:35,811 --> 00:07:37,487
<b>You've already succeeded.</b>

103
00:07:38,042 --> 00:07:39,487
<b>I couldn't recognize you at first.</b>

104
00:07:40,342 --> 00:07:41,417
<b>Me neither.</b>

105
00:07:41,751 --> 00:07:45,196
<b>I'm going to surprise my mom by getting into Hankuk University.</b>

106
00:07:45,452 --> 00:07:47,557
<b>- "Hankuk University"? - I repeated a year.</b>

107
00:07:49,321 --> 00:07:51,396
<b>Hyeong Ju, do you have any plans?</b>

108
00:07:53,691 --> 00:07:54,836
<b>Well...</b>

109
00:07:56,261 --> 00:07:57,607
<b>I've already...</b>

110
00:07:58,631 --> 00:07:59,737
<b>done it.</b>

111
00:08:01,261 --> 00:08:03,070
<b>You all have set plans.</b>

112
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,746
<b>I don't.</b>

113
00:08:05,642 --> 00:08:07,772
<b>The fact that we've rewinded a year's worth of time...</b>

114
00:08:07,772 --> 00:08:09,217
<b>is an opportunity in itself.</b>

115
00:08:09,511 --> 00:08:11,642
<b>You can make plans from now on.</b>

116
00:08:11,642 --> 00:08:14,557
<b>Why do you all think that only good things will happen?</b>

117
00:08:16,881 --> 00:08:18,782
<b>Do you think it's a coincidence that the deliveryman died?</b>

118
00:08:18,782 --> 00:08:20,227
<b>What do you mean by that?</b>

119
00:08:22,792 --> 00:08:24,396
<b>Then what is it?</b>

120
00:08:25,991 --> 00:08:28,662
<b>I don't know.</b>

121
00:08:28,662 --> 00:08:31,737
<b>My gut just tells me that it's not a coincidence.</b>

122
00:08:31,861 --> 00:08:35,071
<b>Oh, come on. That means you know nothing.</b>

123
00:08:35,072 --> 00:08:37,047
<b>Why would you say such a thing?</b>

124
00:08:37,871 --> 00:08:39,946
<b>- How's the coffee? - It's good.</b>

125
00:08:41,072 --> 00:08:42,887
<b>- Come by often. - We will.</b>

126
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:52,956
<b>- What is it? - Give it to me.</b>

127
00:09:05,361 --> 00:09:06,507
<b>Of course.</b>

128
00:09:06,761 --> 00:09:09,076
<b>There's always a cop in these sorts of things.</b>

129
00:09:20,442 --> 00:09:21,781
<b>Why did you take these photos?</b>

130
00:09:21,781 --> 00:09:24,657
<b>- Is it wrong? - Yes, if they didn't consent.</b>

131
00:09:25,121 --> 00:09:27,452
<b>You could get sued for every single one of these.</b>

132
00:09:27,452 --> 00:09:29,267
<b>They're like items.</b>

133
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:31,997
<b>- What? - I need items to fight.</b>

134
00:09:32,121 --> 00:09:34,297
<b>I want to be prepared before I get attacked.</b>

135
00:09:35,261 --> 00:09:37,137
<b>What do you mean? "Items"?</b>

136
00:09:37,462 --> 00:09:40,537
<b>I'm trying to determine what the hidden rules are.</b>

137
00:09:43,501 --> 00:09:45,247
<b>You're quite slow for a cop.</b>

138
00:09:46,741 --> 00:09:48,277
<b>The delivery man's death was a teaser.</b>

139
00:09:48,611 --> 00:09:49,787
<b>The real game begins now.</b>

140
00:09:50,741 --> 00:09:54,116
<b>We've been invited to play the Death Note Game.</b>

141
00:09:57,411 --> 00:10:00,797
<b>Cut that nonsense and delete these.</b>

142
00:10:01,322 --> 00:10:04,027
<b>Aren't you curious who the next victim will be?</b>

143
00:10:05,562 --> 00:10:07,497
<b>I'm suspecting that it's a woman.</b>

144
00:10:08,021 --> 00:10:10,537
<b>- A woman? - That woman in a wheelchair.</b>

145
00:10:44,031 --> 00:10:45,877
<b>Okay. Strike another pose.</b>

146
00:10:51,741 --> 00:10:53,377
<b>I'm done.</b>

147
00:10:54,641 --> 00:10:55,917
<b>Maru, let's go.</b>

148
00:10:56,871 --> 00:10:57,986
<b>Maru!</b>

149
00:11:01,212 --> 00:11:02,356
<b>Maru!</b>

150
00:11:02,982 --> 00:11:05,897
<b>Maru! Maru!</b>

151
00:11:07,052 --> 00:11:08,157
<b>Maru!</b>

152
00:11:09,222 --> 00:11:10,466
<b>Maru!</b>

153
00:11:13,092 --> 00:11:14,236
<b>Maru!</b>

154
00:11:22,602 --> 00:11:26,171
<b>(Be careful!)</b>

155
00:11:26,172 --> 00:11:27,747
<b>It's today.</b>

156
00:11:31,241 --> 00:11:32,356
<b>Maru.</b>

157
00:11:32,712 --> 00:11:35,787
<b>Let's skip our walk today and walk twice as much tomorrow.</b>

158
00:11:45,092 --> 00:11:47,797
<b>Drawing the same scenes is a headache.</b>

159
00:11:52,732 --> 00:11:54,007
<b>Ga Hyeon.</b>

160
00:11:55,371 --> 00:11:56,946
<b>Can we talk?</b>

161
00:12:12,021 --> 00:12:13,257
<b>Ga Hyeon.</b>

162
00:12:14,422 --> 00:12:16,027
<b>Please open the door.</b>

163
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:22,137
<b>I know you're in there.</b>

164
00:12:32,972 --> 00:12:34,346
<b>I left a letter for you.</b>

165
00:12:34,401 --> 00:12:37,716
<b>You don't have to see me, but please do read my letter.</b>

166
00:12:45,552 --> 00:12:47,121
<b>Hey, Maru!</b>

167
00:12:47,121 --> 00:12:49,127
<b>Maru! Maru!</b>

168
00:12:49,751 --> 00:12:51,936
<b>Maru! Maru!</b>

169
00:12:55,021 --> 00:12:56,236
<b>Maru!</b>

170
00:12:58,361 --> 00:12:59,576
<b>Maru!</b>

171
00:13:04,932 --> 00:13:06,047
<b>Goodness, Maru.</b>

172
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:09,316
<b>My phone. Where's my...</b>

173
00:13:10,141 --> 00:13:13,816
<b>("Hidden Killer")</b>

174
00:13:19,781 --> 00:13:22,267
<b>- Yes? - Is Maru over there?</b>

175
00:13:22,751 --> 00:13:24,326
<b>Why would Maru be here?</b>

176
00:13:24,621 --> 00:13:26,291
<b>Wait, did you lose your dog again?</b>

177
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:27,962
<b>Never mind, then. Goodbye.</b>

178
00:13:27,962 --> 00:13:29,137
<b>Wait!</b>

179
00:13:29,861 --> 00:13:31,267
<b>Where are you?</b>

180
00:13:32,202 --> 00:13:33,736
<b>Hey, Jung Woo!</b>

181
00:13:35,332 --> 00:13:38,332
<b>Excuse me, girls. Have you seen this dog?</b>

182
00:13:38,332 --> 00:13:40,041
<b>- No, we haven't. - No, we haven't.</b>

183
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:42,586
<b>Maru. Maru?</b>

184
00:13:46,511 --> 00:13:48,586
<b>Maru! Goodness.</b>

185
00:13:49,151 --> 00:13:51,456
<b>- What are you doing? - Gosh.</b>

186
00:13:51,511 --> 00:13:54,251
<b>Girls, have you seen this dog?</b>

187
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:55,552
<b>- No. - Oh, no.</b>

188
00:13:55,552 --> 00:13:56,966
<b>Maru.</b>

189
00:13:58,151 --> 00:13:59,397
<b>Maru?</b>

190
00:14:00,592 --> 00:14:01,797
<b>Maru.</b>

191
00:14:03,062 --> 00:14:04,407
<b>Maru.</b>

192
00:14:04,732 --> 00:14:05,907
<b>Maru...</b>

193
00:14:15,908 --> 00:14:20,908


194
00:14:31,352 --> 00:14:32,497
<b>Ga Hyeon!</b>

195
00:14:34,261 --> 00:14:35,407
<b>Ga Hyeon.</b>

196
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:38,037
<b>What's wrong? Are you okay?</b>

197
00:14:44,131 --> 00:14:45,316
<b>Here.</b>

198
00:14:51,812 --> 00:14:53,387
<b>Was it a car accident...</b>

199
00:14:54,381 --> 00:14:55,751
<b>that made you sit in the wheelchair?</b>

200
00:14:55,751 --> 00:14:57,027
<b>A hit-and-run accident.</b>

201
00:14:58,682 --> 00:15:00,356
<b>It happened right there...</b>

202
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:04,326
<b>a year ago today.</b>

203
00:15:04,651 --> 00:15:06,066
<b>Aren't you curious...</b>

204
00:15:06,361 --> 00:15:07,897
<b>who the next victim will be?</b>

205
00:15:08,562 --> 00:15:10,232
<b>I'm suspecting that it's a woman.</b>

206
00:15:10,232 --> 00:15:12,537
<b>- A woman? - That woman in a wheelchair.</b>

207
00:15:16,001 --> 00:15:19,716
<b>That's why I was going to stay home all day.</b>

208
00:15:19,802 --> 00:15:21,976
<b>I lost Maru at that time,</b>

209
00:15:22,342 --> 00:15:24,486
<b>so I didn't even take Maru for a walk.</b>

210
00:15:25,011 --> 00:15:26,486
<b>Come to think about it,</b>

211
00:15:27,082 --> 00:15:29,757
<b>I met Maru around now.</b>

212
00:15:30,082 --> 00:15:32,326
<b>I knew this would happen, but I ended up here again.</b>

213
00:15:34,982 --> 00:15:37,696
<b>I guess some things are just bound to happen.</b>

214
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:41,566
<b>You're right. Things end up happening.</b>

215
00:15:43,092 --> 00:15:46,206
<b>But it's possible to stop it too.</b>

216
00:15:47,901 --> 00:15:50,206
<b>There was a culprit that I had to catch.</b>

217
00:15:50,871 --> 00:15:52,677
<b>Are you a police officer?</b>

218
00:15:54,741 --> 00:15:57,071
<b>So did you catch the culprit?</b>

219
00:15:57,072 --> 00:16:00,312
<b>He tried to commit the same crime on the same day,</b>

220
00:16:00,312 --> 00:16:01,856
<b>so I arrested him.</b>

221
00:16:03,452 --> 00:16:06,826
<b>Is that why you reset?</b>

222
00:16:09,121 --> 00:16:10,751
<b>Anyway, what I'm trying to say is...</b>

223
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:13,562
<b>you can stop this from happening if you take preventative measures.</b>

224
00:16:13,562 --> 00:16:16,592
<b>I'll look for Maru. Go back home and stay in for today.</b>

225
00:16:16,592 --> 00:16:18,606
<b>No, I couldn't do that.</b>

226
00:16:19,732 --> 00:16:21,976
<b>I am a police officer.</b>

227
00:16:24,501 --> 00:16:25,716
<b>A part of Violent Crimes Investigation.</b>

228
00:16:25,972 --> 00:16:28,787
<b>You may be a detective, but that doesn't mean you'll find my dog.</b>

229
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:36,157
<b>Yes, hello?</b>

230
00:16:37,212 --> 00:16:39,427
<b>Yes. Yes, that's me.</b>

231
00:16:44,751 --> 00:16:48,196
<b>Maru. Where have you been?</b>

232
00:16:49,361 --> 00:16:50,537
<b>Ga Hyeon.</b>

233
00:16:51,861 --> 00:16:53,702
<b>Hey, Yeon Soo.</b>

234
00:16:53,702 --> 00:16:56,202
<b>Goodness, that was your dog?</b>

235
00:16:56,202 --> 00:16:57,907
<b>Gosh, yes.</b>

236
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:01,277
<b>What are the chances?</b>

237
00:17:01,442 --> 00:17:03,041
<b>Exactly.</b>

238
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:06,116
<b>Thank you for finding Maru.</b>

239
00:17:06,142 --> 00:17:09,156
<b>I didn't do much. I just gave you a call.</b>

240
00:17:11,011 --> 00:17:13,096
<b>I found Maru thanks to you, Hyeong Ju.</b>

241
00:17:13,251 --> 00:17:15,467
<b>It would've been really bad if you didn't put this on.</b>

242
00:17:16,152 --> 00:17:18,527
<b>It looks like you two had been acquainted.</b>

243
00:17:19,662 --> 00:17:21,261
<b>Well, yes.</b>

244
00:17:21,261 --> 00:17:22,406
<b>What?</b>

245
00:17:24,392 --> 00:17:26,601
<b>- He's my fan. - What? Your fan?</b>

246
00:17:26,601 --> 00:17:27,676
<b>Yes.</b>

247
00:17:28,801 --> 00:17:32,547
<b>I'm a huge fan of her artwork.</b>

248
00:17:32,741 --> 00:17:35,747
<b>Oh, so you're an artist.</b>

249
00:17:37,442 --> 00:17:38,646
<b>Yeon Soo.</b>

250
00:17:40,081 --> 00:17:41,612
<b>Please excuse me.</b>

251
00:17:41,612 --> 00:17:44,727
<b>If it's okay with you, let's all grab a cup of coffee.</b>

252
00:17:44,851 --> 00:17:47,081
<b>Let's do that, Yeon Soo. Let me return your favor.</b>

253
00:17:47,081 --> 00:17:48,497
<b>What would you like?</b>

254
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:51,227
<b>Do you know them?</b>

255
00:17:52,622 --> 00:17:53,866
<b>Well...</b>

256
00:17:53,991 --> 00:17:56,737
<b>They're all regulars here.</b>

257
00:17:57,192 --> 00:17:58,932
<b>My business is pretty slow,</b>

258
00:17:58,932 --> 00:18:01,101
<b>so my customers usually greet each other.</b>

259
00:18:01,101 --> 00:18:04,101
<b>I see. I'm Kim Dae Sung.</b>

260
00:18:04,101 --> 00:18:05,777
<b>I'm her fiance.</b>

261
00:18:07,402 --> 00:18:10,011
<b>We really have to go. I'll see you next time.</b>

262
00:18:10,011 --> 00:18:12,916
<b>- Oh, all right. - That's a shame.</b>

263
00:18:13,142 --> 00:18:14,341
<b>- Thank... - Goodbye, then.</b>

264
00:18:14,341 --> 00:18:16,687
<b>Thank you for your help.</b>

265
00:18:35,402 --> 00:18:36,606
<b>Let's go.</b>

266
00:18:38,132 --> 00:18:39,477
<b>This is it.</b>

267
00:18:39,672 --> 00:18:41,116
<b>This building?</b>

268
00:18:41,801 --> 00:18:45,017
<b>I see. This is the studio where you made that classic.</b>

269
00:18:45,942 --> 00:18:47,856
<b>Thank you for your help today.</b>

270
00:18:47,982 --> 00:18:49,727
<b>I ended up owing you twice.</b>

271
00:18:50,351 --> 00:18:52,856
<b>Don't just say it.</b>

272
00:18:53,152 --> 00:18:54,957
<b>Who in the world is Samson?</b>

273
00:18:55,751 --> 00:18:57,122
<b>Are you that curious?</b>

274
00:18:57,122 --> 00:18:59,497
<b>Of course. Think about the cliffhanger.</b>

275
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:02,807
<b>I knew it was a great ending.</b>

276
00:19:03,162 --> 00:19:05,007
<b>I signed a contract, so I can't tell you that.</b>

277
00:19:05,462 --> 00:19:07,902
<b>Come on, you can't do that to me.</b>

278
00:19:07,902 --> 00:19:10,872
<b>What if I ruin the story by telling people what comes before Samson?</b>

279
00:19:10,872 --> 00:19:13,816
<b>Then I'll probably write a different story to avoid that one.</b>

280
00:19:13,841 --> 00:19:16,747
<b>Then you'll never know who Samson is.</b>

281
00:19:19,882 --> 00:19:21,316
<b>Goodbye, then.</b>

282
00:19:21,781 --> 00:19:22,957
<b>Bye.</b>

283
00:19:23,682 --> 00:19:26,321
<b>Hey. You never know,</b>

284
00:19:26,321 --> 00:19:28,197
<b>so don't go outside today.</b>

285
00:19:29,192 --> 00:19:30,297
<b>Okay.</b>

286
00:19:33,991 --> 00:19:36,437
<b>Maru, you've done well today.</b>

287
00:20:36,892 --> 00:20:38,491
<b>Yes, hello?</b>

288
00:20:38,491 --> 00:20:40,066
<b>Hey, Shin Ga Hyeon.</b>

289
00:20:42,862 --> 00:20:45,366
<b>You sent my portfolio to your company.</b>

290
00:20:46,702 --> 00:20:48,777
<b>They called and asked me to sign with them.</b>

291
00:20:49,771 --> 00:20:51,277
<b>Why did you do that?</b>

292
00:20:51,972 --> 00:20:54,571
<b>Are you telling me to go die, pretending to help me?</b>

293
00:20:54,571 --> 00:20:57,616
<b>I just didn't want to see your stuff in my studio.</b>

294
00:20:57,811 --> 00:20:59,057
<b>Stop overreacting.</b>

295
00:20:59,412 --> 00:21:02,426
<b>I want to turn back the time just for a year.</b>

296
00:21:04,112 --> 00:21:05,780
<b>Ga Hyeon.</b>

297
00:21:05,781 --> 00:21:08,227
<b>I have something to tell you face to face.</b>

298
00:21:08,452 --> 00:21:11,692
<b>I'm on my way there, so open the door for me.</b>

299
00:21:11,692 --> 00:21:13,962
<b>Don't come. How dare you come here?</b>

300
00:21:13,962 --> 00:21:15,707
<b>Then do you want to come out?</b>

301
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:17,962
<b>I'm near exit eight of Sodam Park...</b>

302
00:21:17,962 --> 00:21:19,406
<b>Hey, Min Ju Young.</b>

303
00:21:20,732 --> 00:21:22,336
<b>Listen to me.</b>

304
00:21:22,601 --> 00:21:26,477
<b>You're a brat who stole your best friend's boyfriend.</b>

305
00:21:26,872 --> 00:21:30,086
<b>I want you to disappear from my life...</b>

306
00:21:30,912 --> 00:21:33,787
<b>No, I want you to disappear from this world.</b>

307
00:21:33,811 --> 00:21:35,257
<b>So don't ever...</b>

308
00:21:41,722 --> 00:21:42,926
<b>Min Ju Young.</b>

309
00:21:45,222 --> 00:21:46,437
<b>Ju Young?</b>

310
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:48,636
<b>Hey, answer me.</b>

311
00:21:51,132 --> 00:21:52,437
<b>(Ju Young)</b>

312
00:21:57,402 --> 00:21:59,101
<b>It's a car accident. It's the street in front of...</b>

313
00:21:59,101 --> 00:22:00,501
<b>exit eight of Sodam Park in Banho-dong.</b>

314
00:22:00,501 --> 00:22:01,747
<b>Please hurry.</b>

315
00:22:32,942 --> 00:22:34,176
<b>Ju Young.</b>

316
00:22:46,182 --> 00:22:47,356
<b>No.</b>

317
00:22:48,321 --> 00:22:49,467
<b>This can't happen.</b>

318
00:23:00,432 --> 00:23:02,136

<b>Please stay here for now.</b>

<b>Ga Hyeon.</b>

<b>What... What happened?</b>

322
00:23:19,851 --> 00:23:22,797
<b>It's because of me. Because of me, Ju Young...</b>

323
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:24,797
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

324
00:23:25,152 --> 00:23:26,497
<b>What did you do?</b>

325
00:24:00,962 --> 00:24:03,791
<b>Ms. Lee, please let me return to the time before the reset.</b>

326
00:24:03,791 --> 00:24:05,507
<b>I want to return. No.</b>

327
00:24:05,662 --> 00:24:06,901
<b>I have to go back.</b>

328
00:24:06,902 --> 00:24:08,431
<b>What's going on, Ga Hyeon?</b>

329
00:24:08,432 --> 00:24:09,807
<b>My...</b>

330
00:24:10,372 --> 00:24:12,717
<b>My friend got into the same accident that I had.</b>

331
00:24:12,872 --> 00:24:16,047
<b>The same time, the same place. It was exactly like that time.</b>

332
00:24:17,771 --> 00:24:18,987
<b>Wait.</b>

333
00:24:20,442 --> 00:24:23,227
<b>Did she get hurt because I avoided the accident?</b>

334
00:24:23,511 --> 00:24:26,957
<b>Is that so? You've done this a lot, so I'm sure you would know.</b>

335
00:24:28,281 --> 00:24:31,666
<b>That had never happened to me before.</b>

336
00:24:32,491 --> 00:24:35,437
<b>It might be the butterfly effect caused by your choice,</b>

337
00:24:36,291 --> 00:24:39,437
<b>but I'm sure she didn't get hurt in your place...</b>

338
00:24:40,432 --> 00:24:41,661
<b>or anything of that sort.</b>

339
00:24:41,662 --> 00:24:43,747
<b>You're only speculating too.</b>

340
00:24:43,831 --> 00:24:46,101
<b>It was your first time resetting as a group,</b>

341
00:24:46,101 --> 00:24:48,477
<b>so you don't know what the cost is.</b>

342
00:24:49,811 --> 00:24:51,217
<b>It'll be the same.</b>

343
00:24:52,311 --> 00:24:54,080
<b>It'll be impossible to find the culprit,</b>

344
00:24:54,081 --> 00:24:56,080
<b>and the accident will become a cold case.</b>

345
00:24:56,081 --> 00:24:58,126
<b>Then Ju Young will...</b>

346
00:25:00,321 --> 00:25:02,096
<b>This time, it might be different.</b>

347
00:25:03,521 --> 00:25:05,527
<b>If it happened at the same time and place,</b>

348
00:25:06,561 --> 00:25:08,437
<b>the culprit should be the same person too.</b>

349
00:25:10,291 --> 00:25:11,707
<b>I'll help you.</b>

350

<b>slowly falling down into the ground.</b>

<b>Your body feels relaxed...</b>

<b>and heavy like cotton soaked in water.</b>

355

<b>Ga Hyeon, you are unable to open your eyes...</b>

<b>or lift a finger.</b>

357
00:25:43,862 --> 00:25:45,366
<b>Ga Hyeon, you are now...</b>

358
00:25:46,061 --> 00:25:47,906
<b>in a state of weightlessness.</b>

359
00:25:59,541 --> 00:26:01,457
<b>You can fly anywhere...</b>

<b>and see anything.</b>

361

<b>Brown shoes.</b>

<b>A man.</b>

<b>He's poking me with something.</b>

<b>What is it? What is he using to poke you?</b>

<b>Look closely.</b>

374

<b>That man is leaving.</b>

<b>He thinks I'm dead.</b>

<b>- No... - Where is he headed?</b>

<b>Did he get in his car?</b>

<b>No, it can't be. No.</b>

<b>- No. It can't be true. - You will wake up now.</b>

<b>Even if I do, he won't believe me.</b>

<b>Hey, forget about that case.</b>

<b>Yes, he did ask me a lot of questions.</b>

<b>He got a new car around this time.</b>

<b>But not long after our marriage,</b>

<b>he started to change.</b>

457

<b>He had nightmares every night...</b>

<b>and seemed like he had a secret.</b>

<b>Earlier today, we broke up.</b>

<b>He couldn't understand,</b>

<b>so we decided to take a break.</b>

466
00:32:41,948 --> 00:32:43,352
<b>And then, I went home.</b>

467
00:32:44,948 --> 00:32:46,322

<b>And did you?</b>

515

518

<b>If he's truly the hit-and-run driver,</b>

544

631
00:44:20,108 --> 00:44:21,878
<b>Will you leave us and join the Traffic Department?</b>

632
00:44:21,878 --> 00:44:22,907
<b>Is that true?</b>

633
00:44:22,907 --> 00:44:24,848
<b>- Are you betraying us? - Is that true?</b>

634
00:44:24,848 --> 00:44:27,992
<b>You... It's not what you think.</b>

635
00:44:28,748 --> 00:44:30,348
<b>That's even more suspicious,</b>

636
00:44:30,348 --> 00:44:31,547
<b>- Yes. - Exactly.</b>

637
00:44:31,547 --> 00:44:33,958
<b>- You even put off your own cases. - You put off your cases.</b>

638
00:44:33,958 --> 00:44:36,427
<b>Why would you be working on your precious days off?</b>

639
00:44:36,427 --> 00:44:38,187
<b>- Exactly. - And it's a traffic accident!</b>

640
00:44:38,187 --> 00:44:39,458
<b>It's a traffic accident.</b>

641
00:44:39,458 --> 00:44:41,433
<b>- They are right. - Come on!</b>

642
00:44:42,258 --> 00:44:45,073
<b>If you keep harassing me like this, I'll really transfer.</b>

643
00:44:45,228 --> 00:44:47,142
<b>- What? - I mean...</b>

644
00:44:47,598 --> 00:44:49,407
<b>Something is bothering me.</b>

645
00:44:49,407 --> 00:44:50,667
<b>But I don't have evidence.</b>

646
00:44:50,667 --> 00:44:52,108
<b>And I happen to be on my days off.</b>

647
00:44:52,108 --> 00:44:54,083
<b>So I was just trying to figure this out.</b>

648
00:44:54,238 --> 00:44:55,708
<b>I won't transfer to the Traffic Department.</b>

649
00:44:55,708 --> 00:44:58,077
<b>And they won't accept a lazy detective like me.</b>

650
00:44:58,077 --> 00:45:00,522
<b>Don't act like you liked having me here.</b>

651
00:45:00,547 --> 00:45:04,447
<b>I mean, we've been doing pretty good...</b>

652
00:45:04,447 --> 00:45:06,518
<b>thanks to your good work these days.</b>

653
00:45:06,518 --> 00:45:07,718
<b>- Right. - You know?</b>

654
00:45:07,718 --> 00:45:09,358
<b>As for detectives, there's a time in life...</b>

655
00:45:09,358 --> 00:45:12,858
<b>- when their hunches are golden. - Right. It's now.</b>

656
00:45:12,858 --> 00:45:14,157
<b>- That happens. - Yes.</b>

657
00:45:14,157 --> 00:45:16,697
<b>- It's now. - Don't use that up on other cases.</b>

658
00:45:16,697 --> 00:45:18,827
<b>Go all-in and use them up with our cases.</b>

659
00:45:18,827 --> 00:45:20,338
<b>- Go all-in. - Okay?</b>

660
00:45:20,338 --> 00:45:22,043
<b>Okay? Go all-in with us.</b>

661
00:45:22,667 --> 00:45:24,407
<b>The call history. Is that it?</b>

662
00:45:24,407 --> 00:45:25,982
<b>- The burner... - We're leaving!</b>

663
00:45:27,138 --> 00:45:28,176
<b>Let go.</b>

664
00:45:28,177 --> 00:45:29,323
<b>Loosen up.</b>

665
00:45:30,777 --> 00:45:32,892
<b>You must go all-in with our cases!</b>

666
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:34,553
<b>Sure. Thanks.</b>

667
00:45:44,228 --> 00:45:46,573
<b>- Doctor, this is him. - Okay.</b>

668
00:45:48,998 --> 00:45:51,668
<b>I think we met at the cafe the other day, right?</b>

669
00:45:51,668 --> 00:45:52,773
<b>Yes.</b>

670
00:45:56,807 --> 00:45:58,438
<b>You're a doctor.</b>

671
00:45:58,438 --> 00:46:00,437
<b>How could you leave a girl like that on the street?</b>

672
00:46:00,438 --> 00:46:03,652
<b>Did you forget all about the Hippocratic Oath?</b>

673
00:46:03,777 --> 00:46:06,553
<b>What are you accusing me of all of a sudden?</b>

674
00:46:07,077 --> 00:46:08,753
<b>I'm sure you saw it coming.</b>

675
00:46:10,988 --> 00:46:13,162
<b>Not at all. I don't follow you at all.</b>

676
00:46:14,357 --> 00:46:15,662
<b>Is that so?</b>

677
00:46:15,887 --> 00:46:17,733
<b>All right.</b>

678
00:46:23,968 --> 00:46:26,337
<b>What? Is scrapping a car against the law?</b>

679
00:46:26,337 --> 00:46:28,442
<b>Running away after hitting someone is.</b>

680
00:46:28,738 --> 00:46:30,882
<b>And if the victim is dead,</b>

681
00:46:31,037 --> 00:46:32,513
<b>you'll get a heavier sentencing.</b>

682
00:46:34,008 --> 00:46:36,182
<b>Do you have proof that I was the hit-and-run driver?</b>

683
00:46:36,648 --> 00:46:39,948
<b>Do you see this man? After scrapping your car,</b>

684
00:46:39,948 --> 00:46:43,223
<b>he deleted all the records and quit.</b>

685
00:46:43,648 --> 00:46:45,962
<b>Why would you need to talk to a worker...</b>

686
00:46:46,488 --> 00:46:49,233
<b>who quit his job at the junkyard for this long?</b>

687
00:46:49,557 --> 00:46:51,162
<b>You guys even talked five times.</b>

688
00:46:53,728 --> 00:46:57,297
<b>If this evidence is to hold up in court, you must have a warrant.</b>

689
00:46:57,297 --> 00:47:00,573
<b>I would have escorted you to the station if I had.</b>

690
00:47:00,938 --> 00:47:02,912
<b>You must have thought...</b>

691
00:47:03,067 --> 00:47:05,142
<b>it was all over once you got the car scrapped.</b>

692
00:47:05,537 --> 00:47:07,313
<b>A witness can be evidence too.</b>

693
00:47:08,307 --> 00:47:10,948
<b>If we catch this guy first,</b>

694
00:47:10,948 --> 00:47:13,323
<b>you won't even have a chance to confess.</b>

695
00:47:14,148 --> 00:47:18,063
<b>Even to a scumbag like you, the law can be lenient.</b>

696
00:47:18,387 --> 00:47:20,287
<b>Don't waste your energy on this losing battle.</b>

697
00:47:20,287 --> 00:47:22,233
<b>Just turn yourself in and see the silver lining.</b>

698
00:47:22,587 --> 00:47:23,833
<b>Tell...</b>

699
00:47:24,928 --> 00:47:27,233
<b>Seo Yeon Soo what I told you just now.</b>

700
00:47:27,857 --> 00:47:29,672
<b>This is the last time.</b>

701
00:47:31,268 --> 00:47:33,073
<b>She can't get away with this twice.</b>

702
00:47:40,137 --> 00:47:41,352
<b>Seo Yeon Soo.</b>

703
00:47:41,777 --> 00:47:43,053
<b>Seo Yeon Soo!</b>

704
00:47:46,317 --> 00:47:47,892
<b>That's enough!</b>

705
00:47:48,018 --> 00:47:49,748
<b>She moved out this morning.</b>

706
00:47:49,748 --> 00:47:52,362
<b>You keep yelling at her. You're being really loud.</b>

707
00:48:03,363 --> 00:48:08,363


708
00:48:20,518 --> 00:48:21,692
<b>Ga Hyeon.</b>

709
00:48:24,918 --> 00:48:26,333
<b>You knew, didn't you?</b>

710
00:48:26,488 --> 00:48:28,218
<b>How Seo Yeon Soo and I were connected.</b>

711
00:48:28,218 --> 00:48:31,162
<b>You're connected? What do you mean?</b>

712
00:48:31,458 --> 00:48:33,872
<b>Before the reset, the hit-and-run accident I was in...</b>

713
00:48:34,627 --> 00:48:36,602
<b>was caused by Seo Yeon Soo.</b>

714
00:48:37,567 --> 00:48:40,273
<b>You invited both of us knowing the truth, didn't you?</b>

715
00:48:40,367 --> 00:48:43,107
<b>And did you hypnotize me, so I could find out she was the driver?</b>

716
00:48:43,107 --> 00:48:45,212
<b>Was that part of your plan as well?</b>

717
00:48:45,867 --> 00:48:48,753
<b>Why would I go to such lengths for that?</b>

718
00:48:48,807 --> 00:48:50,978
<b>Just like your claim, if I planned everything,</b>

719
00:48:50,978 --> 00:48:53,077
<b>don't you think I would have seen this coming?</b>

720
00:48:53,077 --> 00:48:54,993
<b>What do I gain from doing something...</b>

721
00:48:55,317 --> 00:48:57,023
<b>that you will find out so easily like this?</b>

722
00:49:01,817 --> 00:49:03,962
<b>I am very sorry about what happened to you.</b>

723
00:49:05,527 --> 00:49:07,773
<b>I will try to think about the best way I can help you.</b>

724
00:49:09,398 --> 00:49:11,442
<b>I think it's better for you to go home today.</b>

725
00:49:14,938 --> 00:49:16,843
<b>You told us to feel free to come to you...</b>

726
00:49:18,537 --> 00:49:20,652
<b>if we had any problems or needed help.</b>

727
00:49:22,607 --> 00:49:25,122
<b>It's like you knew that we would have problems.</b>

728
00:49:26,448 --> 00:49:29,493
<b>Seo Yeon Soo will come to you soon.</b>

729
00:49:30,087 --> 00:49:33,132
<b>When she does, relay this message.</b>

730
00:49:33,688 --> 00:49:37,862
<b>I won't let her get away like the last time.</b>

731
00:49:38,027 --> 00:49:39,632
<b>I will make her pay...</b>

732
00:49:39,827 --> 00:49:42,003
<b>for both of the crimes.</b>

733
00:50:56,837 --> 00:50:58,083
<b>Ju Young.</b>

734
00:51:00,277 --> 00:51:02,753
<b>Please send her off for me.</b>

735
00:51:19,127 --> 00:51:23,898
<b>(The day of your departure will shine everlastingly. Goodbye.)</b>

736
00:51:23,898 --> 00:51:25,372
<b>Hey, Ga Hyeon.</b>

737
00:51:26,468 --> 00:51:28,037
<b>Hi, sir.</b>

738
00:51:28,037 --> 00:51:29,867
<b>I couldn't reach you at all.</b>

739
00:51:29,867 --> 00:51:31,412
<b>Did you hear the news too?</b>

740
00:51:32,008 --> 00:51:33,513
<b>What news?</b>

741
00:51:34,238 --> 00:51:35,912
<b>How could this happen?</b>

742
00:51:38,777 --> 00:51:41,452
<b>To avoid making the same mistake, I went through the reset.</b>

743
00:51:41,777 --> 00:51:44,523
<b>How did I get tangled up in this incident again?</b>

744
00:51:44,817 --> 00:51:46,432
<b>Does it mean...</b>

745
00:51:51,228 --> 00:51:53,372
<b>this is destined to happen to me?</b>

746
00:51:53,797 --> 00:51:55,632
<b>The advice I can give you...</b>

747
00:51:56,627 --> 00:51:58,243
<b>is always the same.</b>

748
00:51:58,968 --> 00:52:01,112
<b>Until the next reset,</b>

749
00:52:02,537 --> 00:52:05,243
<b>survive no matter what.</b>

750
00:52:30,527 --> 00:52:33,412
<b>He told me that his son was getting married next month.</b>

751
00:52:33,768 --> 00:52:36,043
<b>He left before he could attend the wedding.</b>

752
00:52:36,837 --> 00:52:40,253
<b>He was happy about buying his son a house when he won the lottery.</b>

753
00:52:40,508 --> 00:52:42,083
<b>By the way,</b>

754
00:52:42,708 --> 00:52:45,152
<b>why did he pass away all of a sudden?</b>

755
00:52:45,478 --> 00:52:46,553
<b>I don't know.</b>

756
00:52:46,678 --> 00:52:49,493
<b>I can't ask the bereaved family as we've never met before.</b>

757
00:52:49,948 --> 00:52:51,662
<b>It was a heart attack.</b>

758
00:52:52,817 --> 00:52:54,263
<b>Come and sit down.</b>

759
00:52:58,658 --> 00:53:00,902
<b>- How did you know? - This guy is a detective.</b>

760
00:53:02,258 --> 00:53:03,473
<b>You're a detective?</b>

761
00:53:04,198 --> 00:53:06,168
<b>After you called me,</b>

762
00:53:06,168 --> 00:53:08,212
<b>I asked the officers at the district police station.</b>

763
00:53:12,807 --> 00:53:14,837
<b>(Choi Kyung Man)</b>

764
00:53:14,837 --> 00:53:16,013
<b>Hey.</b>

765
00:53:16,377 --> 00:53:18,622
<b>- Cheers. - Cheers. Goodness.</b>

766
00:53:18,708 --> 00:53:20,547
<b>- It was his last day at work. - You just wait.</b>

767
00:53:20,547 --> 00:53:22,347
<b>- He bought his colleagues drinks. - Next week,</b>

768
00:53:22,347 --> 00:53:23,587
<b>I'll buy you Korean beef.</b>

769
00:53:23,587 --> 00:53:25,587
<b>My heart sings</b>

770
00:53:25,587 --> 00:53:27,962
<b>He was fine at the restaurant.</b>

771
00:53:29,188 --> 00:53:32,602
<b>His wife found him passed out near their house.</b>

772
00:53:33,928 --> 00:53:36,097
<b>The deliveryman died not long ago.</b>

773
00:53:36,097 --> 00:53:38,073
<b>Why did another guy die like this?</b>

774
00:53:38,127 --> 00:53:39,712
<b>My gosh. Come on.</b>

775
00:53:39,998 --> 00:53:41,412
<b>I told you, didn't I?</b>

776
00:53:45,208 --> 00:53:47,553
<b>Aren't you curious who the next victim will be?</b>

777
00:53:47,678 --> 00:53:49,112
<b>I'm suspecting that it's a woman.</b>

778
00:53:49,478 --> 00:53:51,352
<b>- A woman? - That woman in a wheelchair.</b>

779
00:53:53,577 --> 00:53:56,093
<b>If not her, it'd be that security guard.</b>

780
00:53:56,988 --> 00:54:00,293
<b>Well, we'll find out soon enough what the actual rule is.</b>

781
00:54:01,617 --> 00:54:03,227
<b>- Delete the photos. - What did you say?</b>

782
00:54:03,228 --> 00:54:04,602
<b>I was right.</b>

783
00:54:05,287 --> 00:54:06,872
<b>I said the security guard would be next.</b>

784
00:54:07,027 --> 00:54:08,102
<b>What?</b>

785
00:54:08,698 --> 00:54:09,773
<b>What?</b>

786
00:54:10,797 --> 00:54:12,797
<b>I figured out the rule now.</b>

787
00:54:12,797 --> 00:54:14,273
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

788
00:54:15,468 --> 00:54:17,343
<b>These two won't be the only ones.</b>

789
00:54:20,277 --> 00:54:21,382
<b>This is...</b>

790
00:54:24,347 --> 00:54:26,152
<b>like a survival game.</b>

791
00:54:27,577 --> 00:54:28,692
<b>Come on.</b>

792
00:54:31,248 --> 00:54:33,763
<b>Are you saying that someone else will die next?</b>

793
00:54:36,387 --> 00:54:37,503
<b>What's the rule?</b>

794
00:54:45,567 --> 00:54:47,243
<b>It's the order people got up.</b>

795
00:54:47,968 --> 00:54:50,243
<b>On the first day we met at Zian Clinic,</b>

796
00:54:50,708 --> 00:54:53,783
<b>the first person to get up from his seat was...</b>

797
00:54:54,577 --> 00:54:58,053
<b>If I reset my life, does it mean I can win the lottery too?</b>

798
00:54:58,748 --> 00:55:01,192
<b>It was the deliveryman.</b>

799
00:55:01,317 --> 00:55:02,422
<b>Right.</b>

800
00:55:02,617 --> 00:55:04,093
<b>- He was? - That's true.</b>

801
00:55:04,218 --> 00:55:05,892
<b>When we met again after the reset,</b>

802
00:55:06,418 --> 00:55:08,493
<b>who was the first person to get up?</b>

803
00:55:08,918 --> 00:55:10,102
<b>Hello, ma'am.</b>

804
00:55:11,327 --> 00:55:12,527
<b>I'll believe you...</b>

805
00:55:12,527 --> 00:55:15,357
<b>if you tell me we can make soybean blocks with red beans.</b>

806
00:55:15,357 --> 00:55:16,803
<b>It was the security guard.</b>

807
00:55:17,297 --> 00:55:19,503
<b>I wasn't sure if it was the person who got up first...</b>

808
00:55:19,668 --> 00:55:22,273
<b>or if it was the person who left the room first.</b>

809
00:55:22,898 --> 00:55:24,182
<b>Now, I'm sure of it.</b>

810
00:55:24,768 --> 00:55:26,682
<b>In the order people got up,</b>

811
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:29,783
<b>they will be killed.</b>

812
00:55:31,877 --> 00:55:34,753
<b>I know that you're joking, but that's a nasty joke.</b>

813
00:55:34,877 --> 00:55:37,993
<b>We'll see which one of us gets up first and we'll know for sure then.</b>

814
00:55:38,248 --> 00:55:39,523
<b>Let's wait and see.</b>

815
00:55:45,627 --> 00:55:48,503
<b>Please don't tell me that you actually believe...</b>

816
00:55:48,758 --> 00:55:50,442
<b>that absurd claim of his.</b>

817
00:56:02,877 --> 00:56:04,723
<b>I got up first this time.</b>

818
00:56:04,948 --> 00:56:06,793
<b>You can relax and go home.</b>

819
00:56:08,377 --> 00:56:12,422
<b>And you should be the last one to get up.</b>

820
00:56:21,027 --> 00:56:22,557
<b>- No! - How could this...</b>

821
00:56:22,557 --> 00:56:24,043
<b>Don't cry.</b>

822
00:56:25,297 --> 00:56:27,273
<b>I can't believe this!</b>

823
00:56:27,597 --> 00:56:29,612
<b>- Oh, no. - Don't cry.</b>

824
00:56:29,668 --> 00:56:30,813
<b>Ga Hyeon.</b>

825
00:56:35,208 --> 00:56:36,823
<b>Let me drop you off.</b>

826
00:56:37,178 --> 00:56:39,247
<b>No, I'll go on my own.</b>

827
00:56:39,248 --> 00:56:41,253
<b>- Let me go with you. - You don't believe...</b>

828
00:56:41,817 --> 00:56:44,223
<b>that ridiculous rule, do you?</b>

829
00:56:44,387 --> 00:56:45,662
<b>No way.</b>

830
00:56:46,617 --> 00:56:49,392
<b>I met with Kim Dae Sung earlier today.</b>

831
00:56:49,658 --> 00:56:52,157
<b>I could definitely tell something was between him and the worker.</b>

832
00:56:52,158 --> 00:56:54,702
<b>Does it mean we can catch him if we catch the worker?</b>

833
00:56:55,428 --> 00:56:58,543
<b>Well, it just means that we have one more possibility.</b>

834
00:57:01,498 --> 00:57:03,983
<b>Thank you for your effort.</b>

835
00:57:04,137 --> 00:57:06,813
<b>You can thank me when I catch the culprit.</b>

836
00:57:07,178 --> 00:57:08,283
<b>Bye.</b>

837
00:57:46,877 --> 00:57:48,122
<b>Seo Yeon Soo.</b>

838
00:57:50,488 --> 00:57:52,192
<b>You knew from the start, didn't you?</b>

839
00:57:52,918 --> 00:57:55,293
<b>You knew that I was the victim before the reset.</b>

840
00:57:55,488 --> 00:57:58,303
<b>No, I didn't. I really didn't know.</b>

841
00:57:58,428 --> 00:57:59,803
<b>That part is true.</b>

842
00:58:00,458 --> 00:58:04,043
<b>I was tortured after causing the accident too.</b>

843
00:58:04,268 --> 00:58:05,843
<b>That's why I reset my life.</b>

844
00:58:07,037 --> 00:58:08,738
<b>Then, you should have avoided doing the same.</b>

845
00:58:08,738 --> 00:58:11,107
<b>You shouldn't have been anywhere near that car!</b>

846
00:58:11,107 --> 00:58:12,543
<b>Of course, I avoided it.</b>

847
00:58:16,607 --> 00:58:17,983
<b>- Right here, Dae Sung. - Hi.</b>

848
00:58:18,577 --> 00:58:19,652
<b>Hello.</b>

849
00:58:21,777 --> 00:58:23,887
<b>- My friends called him... - She didn't drink that much.</b>

850
00:58:23,887 --> 00:58:25,317
<b>without knowing I broke off the engagement.</b>

851
00:58:25,317 --> 00:58:26,932
<b>Yeon Soo, Dae Sung is here.</b>

852
00:58:27,718 --> 00:58:29,932
<b>Yeon Soo, Yeon Soo.</b>

853
00:58:30,228 --> 00:58:32,162
<b>Yeon Soo, wake up.</b>

854
00:58:33,898 --> 00:58:36,233
<b>Yeon Soo, wake up. Yeon Soo.</b>

855
00:58:43,708 --> 00:58:44,912
<b>When I woke up,</b>

856
00:58:46,678 --> 00:58:48,513
<b>the accident had already happened.</b>

857
00:58:54,617 --> 00:58:56,523
<b>I reset my life because of the accident.</b>

858
00:58:58,117 --> 00:58:59,793
<b>But it happened anyway.</b>

859
00:59:02,418 --> 00:59:05,988
<b>I don't care about your excuse. You left after hitting a girl.</b>

860
00:59:05,988 --> 00:59:07,202
<b>Twice!</b>

861
00:59:07,357 --> 00:59:10,627
<b>You chose to do so. Both of you are murderers.</b>

862
00:59:10,627 --> 00:59:11,743
<b>No.</b>

863
00:59:12,198 --> 00:59:14,967
<b>I was going to report it and turn myself in.</b>

864
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:17,343
<b>But Kim Dae Sung said he'd kill me.</b>

865
00:59:17,607 --> 00:59:19,083
<b>He told me to keep quiet.</b>

866
00:59:20,537 --> 00:59:22,313
<b>I'm a victim who was threatened too.</b>

867
00:59:24,347 --> 00:59:27,323
<b>Tell that to the police then. Tell them exactly what happened.</b>

868
00:59:29,948 --> 00:59:31,223
<b>I can't do that now.</b>

869
00:59:32,018 --> 00:59:33,593
<b>I got a chance to reset my life.</b>

870
00:59:33,918 --> 00:59:35,692
<b>Why would I admit to a crime I didn't commit?</b>

871
00:59:39,658 --> 00:59:42,432
<b>That jerk, Kim Dae Sung, will be arrested soon.</b>

872
00:59:42,857 --> 00:59:45,303
<b>And you'll face the same punishment as you were in the car.</b>

873
00:59:45,567 --> 00:59:48,343
<b>Turn yourself in now and beg for my friend's forgiveness.</b>

874

<b>Do you have proof?</b>

875

<b>That hypnosis session?</b>

876
00:59:58,648 --> 01:00:00,593
<b>Do you think that will be admissible in court?</b>

877
01:00:02,148 --> 01:00:03,793
<b>How did you know that?</b>

878
01:00:03,918 --> 01:00:05,692
<b>How do you think?</b>

879
01:00:08,418 --> 01:00:12,202
<b>Don't trust that woman, Lee Shin, too much.</b>

880
01:00:13,228 --> 01:00:14,602
<b>Didn't that woman say...</b>

881
01:00:15,158 --> 01:00:17,142
<b>that she randomly called people?</b>

882
01:00:19,498 --> 01:00:20,843
<b>That's odd.</b>

883
01:00:21,198 --> 01:00:23,273
<b>I never got a call from her.</b>

884
01:00:24,607 --> 01:00:27,253
<b>- What? - That woman came to me...</b>

885
01:00:28,037 --> 01:00:31,323
<b>and brought us together. Got it?</b>

886

<b>Stop right there, Seo Yeon Soo!</b>

<b>- Have a nice evening. - Bye.</b>

<b>And the driver...</b>
