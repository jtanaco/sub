<b>Chairman Ko Yong-deok's wedding
will take place this afternoon.</b>

00:01:06.565 --> 00:01:08.359
<b>I was hoping to give him
a wedding present.</b>

00:01:08.442 --> 00:01:09.735
<b>A bomb?</b>

00:01:09.944 --> 00:01:11.904

<b>-A disturbance.
-A disturbance?</b>

<b>Sounds like fun.</b>

00:01:28.128 --> 00:01:29.797
<b>Since they illegally obtained evidence,</b>

<b>they will lose the trial, too.</b>

00:01:32.091 --> 00:01:34.218
<b>Even if they catch us red-handed,
we can just deny it.</b>

<b>But what if no one finds out
who stole the money?</b>

00:01:36.303 --> 00:01:37.554
<b>They will doubt each other.</b>

<b>-If you'll excuse me.

<b>But sir, unfortunately,

<b>Can you see?</b>

00:03:33.003 --> 00:03:33.962
<b>This is too bad.</b>

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:40.887
<b>You bastard. Do you want to die?</b>

00:19:46.517 --> 00:19:47.685
<b>Shit.</b>

00:19:53.566 --> 00:19:55.026
<b>Hey, tell him that I am sorry!</b>

00:19:55.109 --> 00:19:56.611
<b>Shut your mouth, asshole.</b>

00:20:01.491 --> 00:20:02.742
<b>Get up.</b>

00:20:06.287 --> 00:20:07.205
<b>Die.</b>

00:20:13.544 --> 00:20:14.879
<b>Gi-beom, stop it.</b>

00:20:42.378 --> 00:20:44.880
<b>-Gosh, don't say that.
-You're too kind.</b>

00:20:47.007 --> 00:20:49.176
<b>The truck with the cash has been stolen.</b>

00:20:52.721 --> 00:20:54.682
<b>You fucking idiots.</b>

00:20:55.266 --> 00:20:56.851
<b>I can't wait to work with you.</b>

00:21:08.737 --> 00:21:10.865
<b>The truck with the cash has been stolen.</b>

00:21:16.203 --> 00:21:17.454
<b>What's going on?</b>

00:21:18.038 --> 00:21:19.915
<b>It's nothing.</b>

00:21:20.291 --> 00:21:22.126
<b>He just told me
an important guest is here.</b>

00:21:22.877 --> 00:21:25.838
<b>Why don't you talk to my wife
for the time being?</b>

00:21:25.921 --> 00:21:27.673
<b>-Sure.
-I'd love to chat with you.</b>

00:21:27.756 --> 00:21:29.466
<b>I thought you were an angel from heaven.</b>

00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:30.634
<b>Thank you.</b>

00:21:31.135 --> 00:21:32.511
<b>How was the food?</b>

00:21:32.595 --> 00:21:34.054
<b>It's very good.</b>

00:21:34.138 --> 00:21:35.389
<b>What's going on?</b>

00:21:38.475 --> 00:21:39.935
<b>The steak here is great.</b>

00:21:40.019 --> 00:21:41.312
<b>Damn it!</b>

00:21:42.062 --> 00:21:43.272
<b>You bastard.</b>

00:21:43.355 --> 00:21:45.524
<b>I knew you'd mess things up for me.</b>

00:21:45.608 --> 00:21:46.650
<b>What's your plan now?</b>

00:21:46.734 --> 00:21:49.069
<b>How will you take responsibility for this?</b>

00:21:51.113 --> 00:21:53.324
<b>I'll use the guys and find the truck.</b>

00:21:54.450 --> 00:21:55.993
<b>I'll handle it myself!</b>

00:21:56.076 --> 00:21:57.912
<b>The ceremony isn't over yet.</b>

00:21:57.995 --> 00:21:59.413
<b>What will you do?</b>

00:21:59.705 --> 00:22:02.041
<b>I ought to make a hole in those bastards</b>

00:22:02.124 --> 00:22:04.168
<b>who stole my money.</b>

00:22:04.251 --> 00:22:05.628
<b>You're too worked up, sir.</b>

00:22:06.587 --> 00:22:09.089
<b>Unless your wish is having

00:22:12.551 --> 00:22:14.094
<b>You idiot.</b>

<b>ENTRANCE</b>

00:22:26.523 --> 00:22:28.442
<b>Get the car ready for the chairman.</b>

00:22:29.401 --> 00:22:31.612
<b>Make sure to polish it up.</b>

00:23:02.476 --> 00:23:03.727
<b>What the hell?</b>

00:23:13.279 --> 00:23:15.197
<b>Oh, no! Damn it.</b>

00:23:16.031 --> 00:23:17.783
<b>What's happening? Shit.</b>

00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:18.993
<b>No!</b>

00:23:25.916 --> 00:23:27.876
<b>Damn it.</b>

00:24:26.268 --> 00:24:28.562
<b>ROAD CLOSED</b>

00:24:28.645 --> 00:24:31.648
<b>Hey, what the heck are you doing?</b>

00:24:31.732 --> 00:24:33.442
<b>There's a car accident.</b>

00:24:37.488 --> 00:24:41.200
<b>Car accident, my ass.
I don't even see an ant over there.</b>

00:24:43.035 --> 00:24:44.411
<b>Wait.</b>

00:24:45.496 --> 00:24:47.206
<b>Damn it.</b>

00:24:52.461 --> 00:24:54.004
<b><i>Gwang-cheol, get back to the base.</i></b>

00:24:55.172 --> 00:24:56.590
<b>Sir, turn the car around.</b>

00:25:26.662 --> 00:25:28.122
<b>What the hell is wrong with this?</b>

00:29:15.557 --> 00:29:18.560
<b>No one followed us,
nor were we recognized.</b>

00:29:19.061 --> 00:29:21.688
<b>We've been erased
from all security cameras too.</b>

00:29:21.772 --> 00:29:23.940
<b>Those we fought off
were handed over to the police.</b>

00:29:24.524 --> 00:29:25.400
<b>Good.</b>

00:29:26.026 --> 00:29:28.070
<b>How will you deal with Kang Gi-beom's</b>

<b>erratic behavior?</b>

00:29:30.989 --> 00:29:33.367
<b>Let's see what he has to say.</b>

00:29:34.785 --> 00:29:36.203
<b>Anything else I should know?</b>

00:29:36.286 --> 00:29:38.205
<b>It's about Ko Yong-deok.</b>

00:29:39.039 --> 00:29:42.542
<b>He ran out of the building pissed
and without a protection detail.</b>

00:29:42.626 --> 00:29:45.337
<b>It was his own wedding
with a venue packed with guests.</b>

00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:47.255
<b>He left his bride at the event all alone?</b>

00:29:47.339 --> 00:29:49.132
<b>The car moved in an odd way.</b>

00:29:49.216 --> 00:29:52.010
<b>Could the car accident
be a cover-up of his murder?</b>

00:29:52.094 --> 00:29:54.930
<b>Who'd have the balls
within the organization to do it?</b>

00:29:55.013 --> 00:29:59.059
<b>A single gaze from Ko Yong-deok
could have their necks cut off.</b>

00:29:59.142 --> 00:30:02.437
<b>If that's the case,
we have a bold player in the mix.</b>

00:30:42.644 --> 00:30:43.937
<b>Deuk-gu,</b>

00:30:45.439 --> 00:30:48.066
<b>I'll die at this rate.</b>

00:30:48.650 --> 00:30:51.778
<b>The guy who pointed a gun at me
is already dead.</b>

00:30:52.446 --> 00:30:53.697
<b>So what are you talking about?</b>

00:30:54.364 --> 00:30:55.699
<b>Help me.</b>

00:30:56.116 --> 00:30:56.992
<b>Please...</b>

00:30:57.617 --> 00:31:00.203
<b>Take me to a hospital.</b>

00:31:01.747 --> 00:31:02.748
<b>That place</b>

00:31:03.623 --> 00:31:05.375
<b>is only for the sick.</b>

00:31:19.264 --> 00:31:20.724
<b>Choi Ye-won!</b>

<b>You're just in time for the climax!</b>

00:31:41.077 --> 00:31:41.912
<b>Ye-won...</b>

00:31:44.748 --> 00:31:46.124
<b>Hwang Deuk-gu, how dare you.</b>

00:31:46.208 --> 00:31:48.001
<b>I've got to hand it to you.</b>

00:31:48.084 --> 00:31:49.503
<b>You rarely flinch.</b>

00:31:50.462 --> 00:31:53.298
<b>I didn't think you'd come here
all by yourself.</b>

00:31:54.007 --> 00:31:56.134
<b>You're not just a pretty face.</b>

00:31:56.218 --> 00:31:57.135
<b>It</b>

00:31:58.011 --> 00:32:01.181
<b>actually takes guts
to look me in the eyes.</b>

00:32:05.227 --> 00:32:07.479
<b>That will make the story more believable.</b>

00:32:07.562 --> 00:32:09.856
<b>A treacherous bitch</b>

00:32:10.148 --> 00:32:12.025
<b>who killed her own husband</b>

00:32:12.108 --> 00:32:13.944
<b>to have his money all to herself.</b>

00:32:14.903 --> 00:32:16.071
<b>What?</b>

00:32:16.613 --> 00:32:19.282
<b>I'm sure you can play the part well.</b>

00:32:20.659 --> 00:32:23.537
<b>I'm already in possession of his assets.</b>

00:32:28.625 --> 00:32:30.335
<b>Let me see.</b>

00:32:31.086 --> 00:32:34.047
<b>The assets he transferred to other names
in preparation for the election?</b>

00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:35.841
<b>It'll take years for you</b>

00:32:35.924 --> 00:32:37.551
<b>to get your hands on them.</b>

00:32:38.844 --> 00:32:41.179
<b>The battle for his throne

00:32:41.263 --> 00:32:44.266
<b>Will you be able to survive

00:32:45.976 --> 00:32:47.185
<b>Shit.</b>

00:32:50.063 --> 00:32:52.190
<b>Weren't you the one
who didn't like dogfights?</b>

00:32:52.732 --> 00:32:54.276
<b>Let me think.</b>

00:32:57.195 --> 00:32:58.196
<b>Right.</b>

00:33:00.866 --> 00:33:03.201
<b>I can't join forces with you

00:33:04.494 --> 00:33:05.495
<b>Here.</b>

00:33:06.162 --> 00:33:08.957
<b>Let's see you get blood on your hands too.</b>

00:33:11.501 --> 00:33:12.502
<b>Well,</b>

00:33:14.504 --> 00:33:17.048
<b>if this isn't your style...</b>

<b>Hold on.</b>

00:33:19.926 --> 00:33:23.805
<b>There's something feistier and sexier.</b>

00:33:23.889 --> 00:33:24.931
<b>Just a second.</b>

00:33:49.164 --> 00:33:50.165
<b>Ye Won...</b>

00:33:52.125 --> 00:33:53.376
<b>Help me.</b>

00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:54.836
<b>Here.</b>

00:33:56.504 --> 00:33:58.465
<b>Quickly and with ease.</b>

00:33:59.007 --> 00:34:00.842
<b>That'll be best for all of us.</b>

00:34:04.804 --> 00:34:05.889
<b>One...</b>

00:34:06.514 --> 00:34:07.891
<b>Mr. Hwang.</b>

00:34:11.728 --> 00:34:12.896
<b>Two.</b>

<b>Hey.</b>

00:34:47.597 --> 00:34:48.765
<b>Is anyone out there?</b>

00:34:51.017 --> 00:34:52.602
<b><i>At least turn on the lights.</i></b>

00:34:53.395 --> 00:34:55.355
<b>The lights are already on.</b>

00:35:05.907 --> 00:35:07.283
<b><i>Then why can't I see anything?</i></b>

00:35:07.909 --> 00:35:09.911
<b>Hopefully, it'll teach you a lesson.</b>

00:35:12.247 --> 00:35:14.374
<b>Don't you mess with me.</b>

00:35:29.305 --> 00:35:32.267
<b>Give me back my vision right now.</b>

00:35:32.350 --> 00:35:34.310
<b>You violated our rules.</b>

00:35:34.394 --> 00:35:36.688
<b>They are the ones who killed Jin.</b>

00:35:37.397 --> 00:35:39.399
<b>How was I supposed to just let him go?</b>

00:35:40.650 --> 00:35:44.154
<b>How can I when I still remember

00:35:44.237 --> 00:35:46.990
<b><i>Tell me when you're ready

<b>Sir.</b>

<b>Let me see.</b>

00:36:29.699 --> 00:36:31.367
<b>Give me back my vision!</b>

00:36:50.762 --> 00:36:51.846
<b>-Mi-na.
-Yes?</b>

00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:54.015
<b>I'm only saying this

<b>Men pull back if you obsess over them.</b>

<b>Gwang-cheol.</b>

00:37:00.522 --> 00:37:03.108
<b>I don't know what goes on

<b>I see.</b>

00:37:06.736 --> 00:37:09.447
<b>I understand his rage though.</b>

00:37:11.449 --> 00:37:12.951
<b>You don't mess with family.</b>

00:37:13.409 --> 00:37:14.994
<b>Were you like that at first too?</b>

00:37:15.078 --> 00:37:16.371
<b>Your sister...</b>

00:37:18.706 --> 00:37:20.625
<b>After what happened to your sister?</b>

00:37:29.050 --> 00:37:32.887
<b>I already beat those
who made my sister suffer,</b>

00:37:32.971 --> 00:37:34.055
<b>so no.</b>

00:37:34.681 --> 00:37:35.682
<b>But...</b>

00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:39.102
<b>There's one I missed.</b>

00:37:40.645 --> 00:37:42.689
<b>-I didn't see his face.
-Likewise.</b>

00:37:44.107 --> 00:37:46.025
<b>I hear his voice whenever I close my eyes.</b>

00:37:49.654 --> 00:37:52.699
<b>Now I feel left out again.
Everyone is serious but me.</b>

00:37:53.324 --> 00:37:55.535
<b>-All your organs were taken from you.
-Yes, that's right.</b>

00:37:56.286 --> 00:37:59.539
<b>Yes, which was the result of
trying to recklessly score a deal.</b>

00:38:00.957 --> 00:38:02.375
<b>Still, I have vengeance.</b>

00:38:02.876 --> 00:38:04.586
<b>Lessons will be taught to those</b>

00:38:11.050 --> 00:38:13.136
<b>Starting tomorrow,

<b>Enjoy then.</b>

00:39:00.433 --> 00:39:01.559
<b>Hold on.</b>

00:39:05.730 --> 00:39:07.106
<b>Okay, here we go.</b>

00:39:13.446 --> 00:39:15.615
<b>-Fast forward to the end.
-Sure.</b>

00:39:23.706 --> 00:39:25.708
<b>This is where the recording stops.</b>

00:39:25.792 --> 00:39:27.293
<b>Can we get a clearer picture?</b>

00:39:27.377 --> 00:39:29.462
<b>Well, it was quite far away</b>

00:39:29.545 --> 00:39:32.340
<b>and the lens broke

00:39:33.675 --> 00:39:36.344
<b>Susan, what does the police report say?</b>

00:39:36.886 --> 00:39:38.263
<b>The car was destroyed by the fire.</b>

00:39:38.346 --> 00:39:41.724
<b>A burned body was found
but it was beyond recognition.</b>

00:39:42.392 --> 00:39:43.518
<b>And the family?</b>

00:39:43.601 --> 00:39:46.062
<b>His newlywed bride came by,</b>

00:39:46.354 --> 00:39:48.022
<b>but that's all it says.</b>

00:39:51.567 --> 00:39:53.611
<b>It looks like a storm will come our way.</b>

00:40:47.457 --> 00:40:48.833
<b>Please stop.</b>

00:41:18.154 --> 00:41:19.280
<b>Jin...</b>

00:41:25.411 --> 00:41:27.205
<b>I will make them pay</b>

00:41:29.332 --> 00:41:30.666
<b>for what they did to you.</b>

00:41:57.193 --> 00:41:58.694
<b>I will seek justice for you.</b>

00:42:48.417 --> 00:42:49.418
<b>Here you go, sir.</b>

00:43:21.575 --> 00:43:22.743
<b>Would you look at that.</b>

00:43:35.589 --> 00:43:37.424
<b>You probably didn't mean to,</b>

00:43:39.385 --> 00:43:40.719
<b>but you got lucky.</b>

00:44:05.661 --> 00:44:06.954
<b>You should at least eat.</b>

00:44:08.205 --> 00:44:09.832
<b>Meanwhile, let me ask you something.</b>

00:44:10.457 --> 00:44:14.795
<b>Where did you get that leather jacket?
I loved how it fits you.</b>

00:44:15.212 --> 00:44:16.839
<b>Is it for bikers?</b>

00:44:16.922 --> 00:44:18.632
<b>I'll have to check my notes.</b>

00:44:19.216 --> 00:44:20.342
<b>Your notes?</b>

00:44:20.968 --> 00:44:23.846
<b>He has high-tech eyes
but an old-fashioned sentiment.</b>

00:44:24.430 --> 00:44:26.849
<b>-Let me ask you something too.
<i>-Sure, go ahead.</i></b>

00:44:28.225 --> 00:44:30.603
<b>I'd like to go back to training.</b>

00:45:13.687 --> 00:45:14.897
<b>What?</b>

00:45:16.482 --> 00:45:18.275
<b>You did great. Next.</b>

00:45:25.783 --> 00:45:26.951
<b><i>The gunshot to the head</i></b>

00:45:27.034 --> 00:45:30.245
<b><i>damaged a part of Mi-na's brain
and left her paralyzed.</i></b>

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:36.794
<b>It's not looking good.
Hurry up and get ready.</b>

00:45:36.877 --> 00:45:38.128
<b>Okay.</b>

00:45:40.756 --> 00:45:42.967
<b>This is Mi-na's MRI scan.</b>

00:45:43.425 --> 00:45:46.095
<b>This chip in her brain
manages her blood flow and balance.</b>

00:45:46.178 --> 00:45:49.848
<b>Just like in your case,
if the chip is knocked out of place,</b>

00:45:51.183 --> 00:45:53.686
<b>her blood could flow backward
and her body could become paralyzed.</b>

00:46:09.576 --> 00:46:10.953
<b>Until when will you take these?</b>

00:46:11.662 --> 00:46:12.913
<b>Am I allowed to dodge them?</b>

00:46:36.145 --> 00:46:37.521
<b>What's next?</b>

00:46:37.730 --> 00:46:40.524
<b>You've become a different man
which is actually scarier.</b>

00:46:48.407 --> 00:46:50.868
<b>Who the hell is this guy? My gosh.</b>

00:46:51.243 --> 00:46:53.370
<b><i>Gwang-cheol suffered
severe burns from an explosion.</i></b>

00:47:09.762 --> 00:47:12.431
<b><i>Electric currents
from his artificial organs </i></b>

00:47:12.514 --> 00:47:14.641
<b><i>stimulates his skin,
thus preventing further necrosis.</i></b>

00:47:14.725 --> 00:47:17.227
<b>What if the currents are cut off?</b>

00:47:17.811 --> 00:47:20.022
<b>Not only necrosis will keep spreading,</b>

00:47:20.606 --> 00:47:22.066
<b>but his organs will shut down.</b>

00:47:23.609 --> 00:47:24.818
<b>Is there no fail-safe?</b>

00:47:24.902 --> 00:47:27.821
<b>That's why I made a wireless battery pack</b>

00:47:27.905 --> 00:47:30.240
<b>that is easy to carry and charge.</b>

00:47:35.579 --> 00:47:36.538
<b>Nine.</b>

00:47:38.749 --> 00:47:39.666
<b>Ten.</b>

00:47:40.834 --> 00:47:42.920
<b>-How's that?
-Good.</b>

00:47:43.003 --> 00:47:45.339
<b>Does he have to sleep with it?</b>

00:47:45.964 --> 00:47:49.468
<b>The headquarters is equipped
with charging devices, so no.</b>

00:47:49.551 --> 00:47:52.221
<b>But he must always
have it with him outside.</b>

00:47:52.721 --> 00:47:53.889
<b>Let's see.</b>

00:47:54.306 --> 00:47:57.935
<b>This indicates how much battery
you have left, so always check it.</b>

00:47:58.101 --> 00:47:59.061
<b>Okay.</b>

00:48:02.898 --> 00:48:06.151
<b>Something similar must've
happened to Han Tae-woong too.</b>

00:48:06.735 --> 00:48:08.320
<b>His metal arm itself</b>

00:48:08.403 --> 00:48:11.156
<b>had to go through
a number of trial-and-errors.</b>

00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:14.159
<b>We called it an upgrade,
but he suffered in the process.</b>

00:48:57.953 --> 00:48:59.913
<b><i>However, what made his arm stronger</i></b>

00:48:59.997 --> 00:49:01.331
<b>was his determination</b>

00:49:01.456 --> 00:49:04.501
<b>and the time he devoted to his training.</b>

00:49:05.919 --> 00:49:07.963
<b>Well, I experienced it first-hand.</b>

00:49:11.008 --> 00:49:12.509
<b>What's his weakness then?</b>

00:49:13.093 --> 00:49:14.803
<b>Mechanically, the arm is perfect.</b>

00:49:14.887 --> 00:49:17.639
<b>But the tissues connected to it</b>

00:49:17.764 --> 00:49:21.852
<b>can suffer great damage
if he loses his focus.</b>

00:49:22.436 --> 00:49:25.522
<b>It's definitely not a field
I'd challenge myself to be in.</b>

00:49:26.690 --> 00:49:28.942
<b>Know your limits, utilize your strengths,</b>

00:49:29.526 --> 00:49:30.903
<b>but avoid what can hurt you.</b>

00:49:31.570 --> 00:49:33.947
<b>Out in the field and even while training,
don't push yourself.</b>

00:49:34.031 --> 00:49:36.658
<b>There's no field job
that doesn't require you to go beyond.</b>

00:49:36.742 --> 00:49:41.038
<b>The eyes are more sensitive,
so being careful is key.</b>

00:49:42.164 --> 00:49:45.834
<b>Meanwhile, I'll keep working harder
to come up with better treatments.</b>

00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:48.003
<b>Sure thing.</b>

00:50:18.575 --> 00:50:20.035
<b>Kang Gi-beom?</b>

00:50:36.969 --> 00:50:38.512
<b>So you're all here.</b>

00:50:49.147 --> 00:50:50.315
<b>Let's sit.</b>

00:50:58.782 --> 00:50:59.992
<b>Oh, this?</b>

00:51:00.367 --> 00:51:02.577
<b>I just can't stand
objects being out of order.</b>

00:51:03.578 --> 00:51:05.872
<b>I never heard about this side-effect.</b>

00:51:06.957 --> 00:51:09.960
<b>The meal's free, so he needed
something to score points with.</b>

00:51:10.752 --> 00:51:12.963
<b>Being born again sure has its perks.</b>

00:51:13.964 --> 00:51:16.300
<b>When we're finally allowed
to freely roam the streets,</b>

00:51:16.383 --> 00:51:19.428
<b>I'll treat you all to a decent meal.</b>

00:51:22.306 --> 00:51:23.515
<b>So what do you have to say?</b>

00:51:26.893 --> 00:51:28.270
<b>I'd like to sincerely apologize.</b>

00:51:28.895 --> 00:51:30.981
<b>I let my emotions get the best of me</b>

00:51:31.481 --> 00:51:33.400
<b>and that jeopardized the mission.</b>

00:51:34.151 --> 00:51:36.153
<b>That only makes you human, you know.</b>

00:51:36.361 --> 00:51:38.405
<b>If you ask me, these two are like robots.</b>

00:51:39.114 --> 00:51:41.825
<b>They always follow the rules
when they're on a mission.</b>

00:51:41.908 --> 00:51:43.618
<b>They won't budge.</b>

00:51:44.619 --> 00:51:45.454
<b>What?</b>

00:51:46.872 --> 00:51:48.040
<b>And?</b>

00:51:49.041 --> 00:51:52.586
<b>I will accept Rugal's path
and protect its mission.</b>

00:51:53.170 --> 00:51:55.464
<b>I'm not admitting
that my vendetta is frivolous.</b>

00:51:56.131 --> 00:51:59.384
<b>I could go off the rails
and end up in solitary again.</b>

00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:02.679
<b>-However, I will try my best.
-That won't cut it.</b>

00:52:03.638 --> 00:52:05.057
<b>You must obey the rules.</b>

00:52:05.390 --> 00:52:06.558
<b>With all my heart,</b>

00:52:09.061 --> 00:52:13.023
<b>I will do my best to make my wife proud.
I promise you that.</b>

00:53:09.663 --> 00:53:14.835
<b>OUR DEEPEST SYMPATHY</b>

00:53:39.192 --> 00:53:42.863
<b>Thinking how you fucked me over
is making me impatient.</b>

00:53:43.864 --> 00:53:46.533
<b>You're a dramatic one, aren't you?</b>

00:53:46.616 --> 00:53:48.034
<b>What?</b>

00:53:49.327 --> 00:53:51.496
<b>It's our money that's missing</b>

00:53:51.746 --> 00:53:53.540
<b>and the dead is one of ours.</b>

00:53:54.583 --> 00:53:56.418
<b>Coming from a rat
who's never been on my level.</b>

00:53:58.044 --> 00:53:59.087
<b>Is that so?</b>

00:54:00.338 --> 00:54:03.091
<b>Well, why don't we start mingling then?</b>

00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:06.595
<b>If you want to, I mean.</b>

00:54:57.479 --> 00:54:59.231
<b>Who do you think you're searching?</b>

00:55:00.357 --> 00:55:02.234
<b>Fucking imbecile.</b>

00:55:08.698 --> 00:55:10.200
<b>Sure, go ahead.</b>

00:55:13.787 --> 00:55:14.621
<b>Finished?</b>

00:55:22.337 --> 00:55:24.381
<b>What did I tell you?</b>

00:55:25.382 --> 00:55:28.677
<b>Be nice to the pup
and it'll grab you by the hair.</b>

00:55:29.386 --> 00:55:32.514
<b>And what did I tell you?</b>

00:55:32.889 --> 00:55:34.266
<b>Spare the rod, spoil the child.</b>

00:55:36.184 --> 00:55:37.394
<b>Look here, old men.</b>

00:55:38.186 --> 00:55:40.105
<b>All we want is for us to be careful.</b>

00:55:40.647 --> 00:55:42.691
<b>What's there to be mad about?</b>

00:55:43.775 --> 00:55:44.776
<b>You.</b>

00:55:47.237 --> 00:55:49.614
<b>Be careful with every word you spit.</b>

00:55:50.365 --> 00:55:53.577
<b>If you can't play along,
then keep your trap shut.</b>

00:55:54.619 --> 00:55:55.620
<b>Jeez.</b>

00:56:10.677 --> 00:56:13.013
<b>Come on. Let's head inside.</b>

00:57:22.749 --> 00:57:25.418
<b>Thank you all for
lending a hand with the funeral.</b>

00:57:26.628 --> 00:57:28.254
<b>Considering the urgency though,</b>

00:57:28.838 --> 00:57:30.799
<b>we should quickly talk business.</b>

00:57:30.882 --> 00:57:32.592
<b>The chairman is dead,</b>

00:57:32.926 --> 00:57:35.387
<b>so what gives you the right
to join this meeting?</b>

00:57:36.805 --> 00:57:37.972
<b>Impatient as always.</b>

00:57:39.057 --> 00:57:40.892
<b>Let's hear her out first.</b>

00:57:41.935 --> 00:57:46.481
<b>Assemblyman Park was behind
the chairman's death.</b>

00:57:46.564 --> 00:57:51.069
<b>-Are you fucking kidding me?
-I know many of you have doubts,</b>

00:57:51.695 --> 00:57:55.824
<b>but this is a moment
to gather our forces to deal</b>

00:57:55.907 --> 00:57:56.991
<b>with a common enemy.</b>

00:57:57.075 --> 00:58:01.037
<b>Stop beating around the bush

00:58:02.122 --> 00:58:04.124
<b>Until we solidify the organization again,</b>

00:58:05.458 --> 00:58:09.587
<b>Mr. Hwang Deuk-gu will take the reins

<b>-What?
-Fucking hell?</b>

00:58:11.673 --> 00:58:14.384
<b>This must be some sort of a joke.</b>

00:58:14.467 --> 00:58:15.552
<b>Just like</b>

<b>the chairman trusted you,</b>

<b>believe in you all.</b>

<b>I was thinking about
