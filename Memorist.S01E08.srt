<b>Everyone you came in contact with will die.</b>

158

<b>Detective Dong!</b>

159
00:17:12,411 --> 00:17:13,570
<b>Detective Dong.</b>

160
00:17:14,671 --> 00:17:17,211
<b>Detective Dong, wake up!</b>

161
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,801
<b>Yes.</b>

162
00:17:34,371 --> 00:17:35,541
<b>No, not yet.</b>

163
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,510
<b>Yes.</b>

164
00:17:41,071 --> 00:17:42,240
<b>Okay, will do.</b>

165
00:17:50,381 --> 00:17:51,480
<b>I'm Kim. I'm a manager.</b>

166
00:17:59,031 --> 00:18:00,561
<b>Why is someone from the NIS here?</b>

167
00:18:02,131 --> 00:18:04,561
<b>Can you read memories without contact?</b>

168
00:18:05,531 --> 00:18:07,831
<b>NIS agents are smart idiots.</b>

169
00:18:08,031 --> 00:18:09,641
<b>People who only say their titles...</b>

170
00:18:10,601 --> 00:18:13,440
<b>are either con artists or NIS

171
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,041
<b>Sorry for the late introduction.</b>

172
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:19,787
<b>I've been your handler for a while.</b>

173
00:18:19,811 --> 00:18:21,250
<b>I never asked to be "handled".</b>

174
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,450
<b>It's the third time...</b>

175
00:18:24,281 --> 00:18:25,490
<b>you lost consciousness.</b>

176
00:18:26,051 --> 00:18:27,666
<b>Once, you can chalk it up to being hit,</b>

177
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,861
<b>but the other two times
were while reading memories.</b>

178
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:32,767
<b>So what? Are you going
to get me a physical?</b>

179
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:34,791
<b>That's right. They already
finished examining you.</b>

180
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:38,200
<b>They say there's nothing wrong
in particular, but it's a bad sign.</b>

181

<b>We've concluded that it'll get
worse if you keep scanning people.</b>

182

<b>Stay out of it.</b>

183
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:44,940
<b>I'll take care of my own body.</b>

184

<b>You're a national asset.</b>

185
00:18:47,341 --> 00:18:50,281
<b>No. You people just want
to use me as a weapon.</b>

186
00:18:50,381 --> 00:18:52,710
<b>You can't continue being a cop anyway.</b>

187
00:18:54,381 --> 00:18:55,520
<b>You'll be found guilty.</b>

188
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,357
<b>If you're done, please leave.</b>

189
00:18:58,381 --> 00:19:00,541
<b>We're not asking you to

190

<b>We'll help you stay on the force.</b>

191

<b>We can't,</b>

193
00:19:14,101 --> 00:19:15,801

194

<b>Helping with our research would be nice.</b>

199

202

<b>I won't be a coward.</b>

203

204
00:19:47,031 --> 00:19:48,601
<b>I don't want to see you again.</b>

205
00:19:49,601 --> 00:19:51,646
<b>No NIS agent is sinless.</b>

206
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:53,990
<b>Stay away before I expose

207
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:57,087
<b>You don't need to get so angry.</b>

208

<b>You're awake.</b>

209
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:02,220
<b>I'll see you again. I wish

<b>- Who was that?
- A mole.</b>

211
00:20:11,891 --> 00:20:14,067
<b>A mole? Why was a NIS agent here?</b>

212
00:20:14,091 --> 00:20:16,877
<b>- Where are my clothes?
- You're not okay.</b>

213
00:20:16,901 --> 00:20:18,401
<b>You were asleep for three days.</b>

214
00:20:19,101 --> 00:20:20,770
<b>Three days? What about Jin Jae Gyu?</b>

215
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,746
<b>He was arrested and
interrogated for 48 hours,</b>

216
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:26,890
<b>but the warrant was denied,
so he was released again.</b>

217
00:20:27,311 --> 00:20:28,341
<b>What?</b>

218
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,486
<b>His lawyer is none other than...</b>

219
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:32,410
<b>that scum of the earth, Im Joong Yeon.</b>

220

<b>He doesn't look it, but he must be loaded.</b>

221
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,331
<b>He must have spent millions of dollars.</b>

222
00:20:47,631 --> 00:20:49,801
<b>I think Metro is setting a trap...</b>

223
00:20:49,901 --> 00:20:52,206
<b>to arrest him once he escapes
through the secret tunnel.</b>

224
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:53,770
<b>They didn't search the tunnel yet?</b>

225
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:54,930
<b>They did.</b>

226
00:20:55,031 --> 00:20:57,277
<b>But they didn't find Jo
Sung Dong's DNA there.</b>

227
00:20:57,301 --> 00:20:59,416
<b>Do you think he'll use it
again? Because he's stupid?</b>

228
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,716
<b>They thought of that,</b>

229
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:03,311
<b>so they searched it carefully
while he was being detained.</b>

230
00:21:03,381 --> 00:21:04,841
<b>In case they need it later.</b>

231
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:08,327

<b>The last day of the month is 10 days away.</b>

233

<b>- Where's Superintendent Han?
- Who knows?</b>

234
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:14,890
<b>We haven't seen her since she

<b>That's why I worry about her.</b>

238

<b>Why must you make it sound so gross?</b>

239
00:21:29,101 --> 00:21:30,117
<b>It's too dangerous.</b>

240
00:21:30,141 --> 00:21:32,946

00:28:23,051 --> 00:28:25,420
<b>I'm sorry,
sir. We're trying our best to find him.</b>

311
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,851
<b>- There he is.
- What?</b>

312
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,401
<b>Have you seen my son?</b>

313
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:47,670
<b>We were at the market,
and he told me he saw you.</b>

314
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,920
<b>- I should call the police.
- He's going to be punished.</b>

315
00:28:57,121 --> 00:28:59,402
<b>He's going to get punished
for what your family has done.</b>

316
00:29:01,121 --> 00:29:03,190
<b>- What do you mean?
- He will get punished...</b>

317
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,760
<b>for what your mother did.</b>

318
00:29:07,531 --> 00:29:09,771
<b>- What are you talking about?
- Do you still not know...</b>

319
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,571
<b>who I am?</b>

320
00:29:15,071 --> 00:29:16,341
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

321
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,401
<b>I raised you...</b>

322
00:29:26,151 --> 00:29:27,381
<b>when you were young.</b>

323
00:30:20,331 --> 00:30:21,371
<b>Where is the kid?</b>

324
00:30:26,571 --> 00:30:29,811
<b>I guess your dirty hands
also touched the kid.</b>

325
00:30:36,121 --> 00:30:37,750
<b>The kid is now qualified.</b>

326
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:39,490
<b>What?</b>

327
00:30:39,551 --> 00:30:41,450
<b>He's qualified to be the third victim.</b>

328
00:30:43,291 --> 00:30:45,091
<b>If anything happens to him, I'll kill you.</b>

329
00:30:45,891 --> 00:30:48,361
<b>Why? You're the one who cursed him.</b>

330
00:31:00,341 --> 00:31:02,881
<b>But he still has more to do.</b>

331
00:31:07,581 --> 00:31:08,910
<b>It's going to happen tonight.</b>

332
00:31:11,821 --> 00:31:13,551
<b>You should hurry.</b>

333
00:31:14,621 --> 00:31:15,750
<b>Tonight,</b>

334
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,190
<b>the third victim will get murdered.</b>

335
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:36,611
<b>Come out here. Come out here, you jerk!</b>

336
00:31:37,541 --> 00:31:40,450
<b>- Calm down.
- Get off me.</b>

337
00:31:40,881 --> 00:31:42,087
<b>- Get off me!
- Stop.</b>

338
00:31:42,111 --> 00:31:43,220
<b>Get a grip of yourself!</b>

339
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:49,051
<b>My goodness.</b>

340
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:02,101
<b>He's evil.</b>

341
00:32:02,531 --> 00:32:04,341
<b>How long did you live with him again?</b>

342
00:32:04,871 --> 00:32:05,970
<b>Up until I was nine.</b>

343
00:32:07,071 --> 00:32:10,281
<b>That's when you were very young.
How can you be so confident?</b>

344
00:32:10,811 --> 00:32:13,351
<b>When my grandma was alive,
she always told me...</b>

345
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:16,881
<b>that my mom didn't commit suicide.</b>

346
00:32:19,151 --> 00:32:20,871
<b>She told me that she was murdered by him...</b>

347
00:32:22,791 --> 00:32:24,791
<b>and that he'll end up killing us too.</b>

348
00:32:25,591 --> 00:32:26,660
<b>Did you check her family?</b>

349
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:29,676
<b>Her mother, Shim Hyo Sook, died in 1992.</b>

350
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:32,636
<b>She was living with Jin Jae Gyu,
but she ran away with another guy...</b>

351
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:35,340
<b>- and committed suicide with him.
- They also found a written will.</b>

352
00:32:37,071 --> 00:32:38,541
<b>I know he killed her for sure.</b>

353
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:40,811
<b>How do you know your
grandma told you the truth?</b>

354
00:32:44,311 --> 00:32:45,791
<b>Because she saw everything in person.</b>

355
00:33:00,131 --> 00:33:01,861
<b>It was right before my mom ran away.</b>

356
00:33:02,861 --> 00:33:04,260
<b>I'm sure it was around then.</b>

357
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,831
<b>Every day, my mom went to town for work.</b>

358
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:10,790
<b>And he, my stepfather,
was the only person home.</b>

359
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:43,701
<b>I got a dog for my birthday.</b>

360
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,870
<b>And that day,
we had just brought him back from the vet.</b>

361
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:18,471
<b>Dad?</b>

362
00:35:03,681 --> 00:35:06,790
<b>After that, my mom ran away from home.</b>

363
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:27,151
<b>I was more scared by the
fact that I was left with him...</b>

364
00:35:27,471 --> 00:35:29,940
<b>rather than the fact that my mom was gone.</b>

365
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,960
<b>Because of what you saw in the forest?</b>

366
00:35:32,881 --> 00:35:34,080
<b>I was always scared of him.</b>

367
00:35:35,551 --> 00:35:37,221
<b>He was always so cold.</b>

368
00:35:38,681 --> 00:35:40,401
<b>It got even worse after my mom disappeared.</b>

369
00:35:41,991 --> 00:35:43,920
<b>He left the house for a few days.</b>

370
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:46,190
<b>And one day, I heard him come home at dawn.</b>

371
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,080
<b>And I realized that he found my mom.</b>

372
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:35,270
<b>He had taken the necklace from her.</b>

373
00:36:43,721 --> 00:36:45,850
<b>But I only found out what
had really happened...</b>

374
00:36:47,151 --> 00:36:49,120
<b>a while later.</b>

375
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:54,161
<b>Our condolences.</b>

376
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:38,940
<b>I made a run for it to
my grandma's that day.</b>

377
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,551
<b>Jae Gyu, I'm sorry.</b>

378
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:55,766
<b>Please don't kill me.</b>

379
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:59,091
<b>My mom was found
hanging next to the other man.</b>

380
00:37:59,591 --> 00:38:01,531
<b>Don't kill me!</b>

381
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,100
<b>But I know the truth.</b>

382
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:05,560
<b>I know that she was murdered...</b>

383
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:07,770
<b>by him.</b>

384
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:12,170
<b>Your memory seems clear and vivid.</b>

385
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:13,571
<b>So why didn't you recognize him?</b>

386
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:15,846
<b>Even the house is the same.</b>

387
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:17,911
<b>I was only nine, remember?</b>

388
00:38:18,341 --> 00:38:20,181
<b>It is natural to forget certain events.</b>

389
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:23,520
<b>But then some memories are too vivid.</b>

390
00:38:23,651 --> 00:38:25,551
<b>How did you come to
live in this neighborhood?</b>

391
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,390
<b>It's where my husband lived.</b>

392
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:30,591
<b>What a strange coincidence.</b>

393
00:38:33,491 --> 00:38:36,631
<b>Which flight did your husband get on today?</b>

394
00:38:36,761 --> 00:38:39,701
<b>The one at noon. I was on
my way back from the airport.</b>

395
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:41,450
<b>We'll be able to reach him in the evening.</b>

396
00:38:41,571 --> 00:38:43,341
<b>My husband isn't the issue.</b>

397
00:38:43,701 --> 00:38:47,111
<b>You need to arrest Jin
Jae Gyu and find my son.</b>

398
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,161
<b>Arrest him again.</b>

399
00:39:07,861 --> 00:39:09,060
<b>What for?</b>

400
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,270
<b>You already failed two
of his interrogations.</b>

401
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:15,401
<b>What else can you do?</b>

402
00:39:16,201 --> 00:39:17,277
<b>Catch him at the scene...</b>

403
00:39:17,301 --> 00:39:19,021
<b>after he leaves through his secret passage.</b>

404
00:39:19,401 --> 00:39:21,040
<b>A kid's life in on the line.</b>

405
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:24,411
<b>That's how scumbags are.</b>

406
00:39:24,881 --> 00:39:26,710
<b>He's trying to get back
at the boy's mother.</b>

407
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:27,810
<b>Detective Dong!</b>

408
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:30,456
<b>Have the district police
search for the kid...</b>

409
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,980
<b>and focus on the secret passage.</b>

410
00:39:32,721 --> 00:39:34,551
<b>He already threatened the boy's life!</b>

411
00:39:35,451 --> 00:39:36,661
<b>That's what he's after.</b>

412
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,420
<b>He's using the boy as a distraction.</b>

413
00:39:39,591 --> 00:39:42,191
<b>The Executioner only kills those
that deserve to die in his mind.</b>

414
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:44,631
<b>It sounds like you know him well.</b>

415
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,071
<b>The Executioner, I mean.</b>

416
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:55,040
<b>Who let him in there?</b>

417
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,080
<b>Drag him out.</b>

418
00:40:01,051 --> 00:40:02,850
<b>Can you please just leave?</b>

419
00:40:16,761 --> 00:40:19,971
<b>Block all the roads and
not just the highways.</b>

420
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:23,170
<b>Check everyone who Detective
Dong came in contact with.</b>

421
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:24,370
<b>Yes, sir.</b>

422
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,011
<b>He may erase memories
but not hard evidence.</b>

423
00:40:28,611 --> 00:40:31,540
<b>Make sure you record every footage you see.</b>

424
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:34,480
<b>Are you insane?</b>

425
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:36,657
<b>I know you don't care
for authority figures,</b>

426
00:40:36,681 --> 00:40:39,080
<b>but you can't talk back to
the deputy chief like that.</b>

427
00:40:39,321 --> 00:40:42,896
<b>What do you have against
me serving the force until...</b>

428
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,361
<b>I'm eligible for a full pension?</b>

429
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,197
<b>Just shoot me instead, why don't you?</b>

430
00:40:46,221 --> 00:40:48,206
<b>If I die on the job, my youngest would...</b>

431
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:50,201
<b>at least be set until college.</b>

432
00:40:50,261 --> 00:40:53,170
<b>Your youngest is smart and
will get a scholarship for sure.</b>

433
00:40:53,531 --> 00:40:54,600
<b>- Right?
- Yes.</b>

434
00:41:03,511 --> 00:41:05,940
<b>(Han Sun Mi)</b>

435
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:08,790
<b>I can't believe you didn't
visit me at the hospital.</b>

436
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,881
<b>I didn't think we were that close.</b>

437
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:14,321
<b>You're right.</b>

438
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:17,067
<b>I was doing some research.</b>

439
00:41:17,091 --> 00:41:18,436
<b>You wasted your time again.</b>

440
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:19,666
<b>That's rich coming from someone...</b>

441
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:22,130
<b>who showed all his cards by
talking back to Deputy Chief Lee.</b>

442
00:41:22,431 --> 00:41:24,901
<b>I see you have a mole in the force.</b>

443
00:41:25,261 --> 00:41:26,931
<b>- So did you find anything?
- Maybe.</b>

444
00:41:27,071 --> 00:41:29,301
<b>- Maybe?
- What did you see in his head?</b>

445
00:41:31,571 --> 00:41:33,140
<b>- The secret passage.
- And?</b>

446
00:41:33,471 --> 00:41:36,810
<b>That was it. The rest was
an illusion created by him.</b>

447
00:41:38,911 --> 00:41:40,226
<b>Just the secret passage then?</b>

448
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:42,451
<b>He could control what I was seeing.</b>

449
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:44,850
<b>So his ability overpowers yours.</b>

450
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:47,091
<b>Unbelievable.</b>

451
00:41:47,551 --> 00:41:49,620
<b>Must you hit me where it already hurts?</b>

452
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:53,091
<b>He not only erases
memories but can control them.</b>

453
00:41:53,361 --> 00:41:54,591
<b>So what is it that you found?</b>

454
00:41:55,631 --> 00:41:58,031
<b>I analyzed the message
left on Jo Sung Dong's body.</b>

455
00:42:01,631 --> 00:42:02,951
<b>Does it say where he'd kill next?</b>

456
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:05,701
<b>No, he didn't leave any breadcrumbs.</b>

457
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,520
<b>Maybe you couldn't find it.</b>

458
00:42:07,971 --> 00:42:09,741
<b>He's only been leaving direct messages...</b>

459
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,940
<b>that led us to the next victims.</b>

460
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,011
<b>There was nothing on Jo Sung Dong's body.</b>

461
00:42:16,151 --> 00:42:18,551
<b>What good does that do when
he has already marked the boy.</b>

462
00:42:19,451 --> 00:42:20,520
<b>What if it's a trick?</b>

463
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:24,591
<b>What if it's a red herring
that he's using to distract us?</b>

464
00:42:25,221 --> 00:42:27,161
<b>- A what?
- A red herring.</b>

465
00:42:27,261 --> 00:42:28,461
<b>And yes, it's the actual fish.</b>

466
00:42:29,031 --> 00:42:31,436
<b>Back in the day, criminals used herrings...</b>

467
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:33,131
<b>to escape the police.</b>

468
00:42:33,261 --> 00:42:37,040
<b>They were baits to throw naive
hunting dogs off their scent.</b>

469
00:42:37,901 --> 00:42:39,547
<b>You just have a way with words, don't you?</b>

470
00:42:39,571 --> 00:42:40,741
<b>Isn't it strange?</b>

471
00:42:41,011 --> 00:42:44,157
<b>Two children of his victims
are investigating his murders.</b>

472
00:42:44,181 --> 00:42:46,511
<b>- Well, it's a coincidence.
- Of course it is.</b>

473
00:42:46,951 --> 00:42:48,781
<b>He never knew we'd join the police force.</b>

474
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:50,657
<b>But both of us being hooked on this case...</b>

475
00:42:50,681 --> 00:42:52,080
<b>wasn't a coincidence at all.</b>

476
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:53,491
<b>Anyone can tell that.</b>

477
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:56,020
<b>He left clues that'll lead us to him,</b>

478
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:59,666
<b>but he keeps playing dumb for some reason.</b>

479
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:01,137
<b>Please stop it from happening.</b>

480
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:03,607
<b>- The third victim...
- On top of that,</b>

481
00:43:03,631 --> 00:43:06,301
<b>he's been acting like a true psychopath...</b>

482
00:43:08,301 --> 00:43:09,401
<b>and has even...</b>

483
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:11,741
<b>shown us his supernatural power.</b>

484
00:43:13,241 --> 00:43:15,341
<b>- Just cut to the chase.
- What is his objective?</b>

485
00:43:15,971 --> 00:43:18,317
<b>What is he trying to get
by baiting us like this?</b>

486
00:43:18,341 --> 00:43:19,411
<b>Revenge, of course.</b>

487
00:43:20,011 --> 00:43:22,151
<b>- Revenge?
- What else can it be?</b>

488
00:43:22,381 --> 00:43:24,381
<b>The Executioner killed
to avenge other victims.</b>

489
00:43:24,651 --> 00:43:27,866
<b>He killed people who he
thought deserved to die.</b>

490
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:29,490
<b>That's what he considers as his calling.</b>

491
00:43:29,591 --> 00:43:31,460
<b>So our parents dying wasn't enough?</b>

492
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,790
<b>There's no other way to explain his game.</b>

493
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:36,960
<b>He's taking out his wrath
from 20 years ago on us.</b>

494
00:43:37,861 --> 00:43:39,781
<b>The wrath he felt from
all three of our parents.</b>

495
00:43:40,131 --> 00:43:42,431
<b>- Three?
- Yes, Hyeon Su's mom.</b>

496
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:45,140
<b>Because she ran off with another man?</b>

497
00:43:45,571 --> 00:43:47,071
<b>It can't be a simple lovers' quarrel.</b>

498
00:43:47,810 --> 00:43:49,341
<b>There must be a hidden secret.</b>

499
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:50,770
<b>Or maybe it's the other way around.</b>

500
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,810
<b>He could be using
revenge to justify his killings.</b>

501
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:57,951
<b>The Executioner kills
to feel the joy of killing...</b>

502
00:43:58,281 --> 00:43:59,396
<b>and masks that in the name of justice.</b>

503
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:01,027
<b>And that's what you figured out?</b>

504
00:44:01,051 --> 00:44:03,151
<b>That he really has no specific reason?</b>

505
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:08,330
<b>What if the third target
isn't the young boy?</b>

506
00:44:08,790 --> 00:44:09,861
<b>Who else could it be?</b>

507
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:14,401
<b>Well,</b>

508
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:17,670
<b>me.</b>

509
00:44:53,571 --> 00:44:56,016
<b>Nothing can be heard from the rabbit hole.</b>

510
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:58,040
<b>I repeat. Everything is
silent at the rabbit hole.</b>

511
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,210
<b>We read you loud and clear.</b>

512
00:44:59,741 --> 00:45:02,480
<b>- How's the GPS?
- Working perfectly.</b>

513
00:45:08,551 --> 00:45:10,027
<b>Officers in cars and on foot...</b>

514
00:45:10,051 --> 00:45:13,491
<b>will take cues from Wild Dog in
an act-first, report-second way.</b>

515
00:45:25,071 --> 00:45:26,571
<b>How many GPS trackers did you set up?</b>

516
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:28,640
<b>One on his car and one on his motorcycle,
sir.</b>

517
00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:30,757
<b>- Is that enough?
- We don't want...</b>

518
00:45:30,781 --> 00:45:32,381
<b>to risk getting caught.</b>

519
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:33,990
<b>I thought he wasn't that bright.</b>

520
00:45:34,781 --> 00:45:36,080
<b>He's quite cunning though.</b>

521
00:45:54,901 --> 00:45:56,571
<b>He's been weaving us in his little game.</b>

522
00:45:57,241 --> 00:45:59,370
<b>It only makes sense that we're his endgame.</b>

523
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:03,210
<b>I'm also one of the people who
you came in contact with too.</b>

524
00:46:06,111 --> 00:46:07,751
<b>You don't have to look so worried though.</b>

525
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:10,957
<b>I'm not worried.</b>

526
00:46:10,981 --> 00:46:12,541
<b>Anyway, I'm just stating a possibility.</b>

527
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:14,620
<b>It's not what I truly figured out.</b>

528
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:16,790
<b>Just tell me what that is already.</b>

529
00:46:17,861 --> 00:46:18,861
<b>An accomplice.</b>

530
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:20,460
<b>An accomplice?</b>

531
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:22,491
<b>You're needed, sir.</b>

532
00:46:30,401 --> 00:46:31,901
<b>Keep up the good work, everyone.</b>

533
00:46:35,810 --> 00:46:37,080
<b>- Work hard.
- Yes, sir.</b>

534
00:46:45,451 --> 00:46:46,580
<b>Get back to work.</b>

535
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:49,620
<b>Pull that up for me.</b>

536
00:47:13,381 --> 00:47:14,881
<b>Hey. Darn it.</b>

537
00:47:33,971 --> 00:47:35,201
<b>It nagged at me.</b>

538
00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:39,701
<b>He's so thorough. Why did he
leave a trail for the water pump?</b>

539
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,611
<b>Do you think it was intentional?</b>

540
00:47:42,810 --> 00:47:45,170
<b>As in, he exposed the secret
tunnel to hide his accomplice?</b>

541
00:47:46,181 --> 00:47:47,281
<b>Read my head.</b>

542
00:47:48,951 --> 00:47:51,750
<b>That's why he showed it to
you when you scanned him.</b>

543
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:53,520
<b>So? Who's the accomplice?</b>

544
00:47:53,651 --> 00:47:55,996
<b>There was a foreign company
that restored abandoned buildings.</b>

545
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:57,821
<b>It was a foreign paper company.</b>

546
00:47:57,890 --> 00:47:59,337
<b>We hacked all the Chinese
administration networks...</b>

547
00:47:59,361 --> 00:48:00,491
<b>and found a clue.</b>

548
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:03,661
<b>The high and mighty Superintendent Han,
hacking?</b>

549
00:48:04,830 --> 00:48:06,036
<b>It wasn't for the case.</b>

550
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:07,330
<b>I'm saving a child.</b>

551
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:09,230
<b>And?</b>

552
00:48:09,531 --> 00:48:12,131
<b>The person in charge of the ghost
company came in four years ago.</b>

553
00:48:14,370 --> 00:48:15,670
<b>Shim Sang Ha's husband?</b>

554
00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:17,980
<b>Yoon In Tae.</b>

555
00:48:19,281 --> 00:48:21,151
<b>The kid's dad used his kid...</b>

556
00:48:24,551 --> 00:48:25,781
<b>He isn't his real dad.</b>

557
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:28,420
<b>He married Shim Sang Ha,
who was a single mom.</b>

558
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:31,721
<b>He isn't on that flight.</b>

559
00:48:32,290 --> 00:48:34,810
<b>He's probably somewhere near Jin Jae Gyu,
receiving his orders.</b>

560
00:48:35,190 --> 00:48:36,631
<b>Yoon In Tae committed murder?</b>

561
00:48:37,401 --> 00:48:38,631
<b>He isn't your ordinary guy.</b>

562
00:48:39,361 --> 00:48:41,401
<b>We found traces of him in the underworld.</b>

563
00:48:42,801 --> 00:48:44,640
<b>Is Jin Jae Gyu really after a child?</b>

564
00:48:44,971 --> 00:48:46,531
<b>Because of something from 20 years ago?</b>

565
00:48:47,471 --> 00:48:48,751
<b>We can't ignore the possibility.</b>

566
00:48:49,071 --> 00:48:52,181
<b>He'll find any reason for
the sake of his pleasure.</b>

567
00:48:53,381 --> 00:48:54,681
<b>So? Where are we headed?</b>

568
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:57,080
<b>Their hideout.</b>

569
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:00,721
<b>Jin Jae Gyu and Yoon In Tae's real hideout.</b>

570
00:49:13,541 --> 00:49:14,712
<b>Don't worry.</b>

571
00:49:15,951 --> 00:49:18,482
<b>Even the riot police are searching for him.</b>

572
00:49:21,422 --> 00:49:22,522
<b>What is that?</b>

573
00:49:23,192 --> 00:49:24,637
<b>That's my husband's ringtone.</b>

574
00:49:24,661 --> 00:49:26,097
<b>Did he leave his phone?</b>

575
00:49:26,121 --> 00:49:27,661
<b>No. I'm sure he took it.</b>

576
00:49:30,802 --> 00:49:31,902
<b>Hold on.</b>

577
00:49:34,302 --> 00:49:35,471
<b>(Restricted Number)</b>

578
00:49:35,902 --> 00:49:37,101
<b>It's my husband's phone.</b>

579
00:49:38,442 --> 00:49:40,741
<b>(Restricted Number)</b>

580
00:49:41,772 --> 00:49:44,282
<b>- Listen carefully.
- What's going on?</b>

581
00:49:44,581 --> 00:49:47,782
<b>- Honey, Hyeon Su's missing...
- Just listen.</b>

582
00:49:48,011 --> 00:49:49,982
<b>- Are you with him?
- Come out the back door.</b>

583
00:49:50,382 --> 00:49:52,057
<b>- What?
- Get out of there now!</b>

584
00:49:52,081 --> 00:49:54,522
<b>Mr. Yoon, this is the police.</b>

585
00:49:58,692 --> 00:49:59,822
<b>Stay here.</b>

586
00:50:38,402 --> 00:50:39,802
<b>This is where the kid went missing.</b>

587
00:50:40,362 --> 00:50:42,478
<b>Yoon In Tae owns dozens of
property here in fake names.</b>

588
00:50:42,502 --> 00:50:43,822
<b>They're all in sketchy locations.</b>

589
00:50:44,342 --> 00:50:46,802
<b>This is where he went missing,
so there's a high probability.</b>

590
00:50:47,342 --> 00:50:49,572
<b>- Do we have a warrant?
- Give me a break.</b>

591
00:50:50,681 --> 00:50:51,782
<b>Do it your way.</b>

592
00:50:52,712 --> 00:50:55,057
<b>- You want me to take the fall?
- They'll go easy on you...</b>

593
00:50:55,081 --> 00:50:56,601
<b>since you're doing it to save a child.</b>

594
00:51:00,791 --> 00:51:02,522
<b>You're as big a lunatic as I am.</b>

595
00:51:03,851 --> 00:51:05,092
<b>He climbed over the wall.</b>

596
00:51:05,522 --> 00:51:07,331
<b>The secret tunnel was a trick.</b>

597
00:51:07,661 --> 00:51:09,192
<b>The child's home was attacked.</b>

598
00:51:09,761 --> 00:51:11,161
<b>The mom was abducted.</b>

599
00:51:12,632 --> 00:51:14,502
<b>Darn it.</b>

600
00:51:14,601 --> 00:51:16,802
<b>Sir, my cell phone.</b>

601
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:19,272
<b>- What phone?
- It's in the car...</b>

602
00:52:21,931 --> 00:52:23,048
<b>We tracked the phone.</b>

603
00:52:23,072 --> 00:52:24,701
<b>It's speeding toward Incheon.</b>

604
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:42,922
<b>He's running.</b>

605
00:52:44,022 --> 00:52:45,702
<b>Block the roads to the airport and harbor.</b>

606
00:53:26,902 --> 00:53:28,032
<b>The kid isn't here.</b>

607
00:53:28,402 --> 00:53:31,072
<b>Knowing him,
there's probably another secret room...</b>

608
00:55:33,991 --> 00:55:35,032
<b>Here.</b>

609
00:55:41,101 --> 00:55:42,172
<b>Open the car door.</b>

610
00:56:38,692 --> 00:56:39,822
<b>You found me.</b>

611
00:56:43,032 --> 00:56:44,532
<b>It's a smart world.</b>

612
00:56:46,902 --> 00:56:48,262
<b>Turn around and get on your knees.</b>

613
00:57:00,241 --> 00:57:02,321
<b>Make sure you don't touch
him when you handcuff him.</b>

614
00:57:04,181 --> 00:57:06,322
<b>It'll take five minutes
for backup to get here.</b>

615
00:57:07,721 --> 00:57:10,922
<b>But it'll only take me three
minutes to deal with you both...</b>

616
00:57:12,561 --> 00:57:14,561
<b>and get on the boat.</b>

617
00:57:39,322 --> 00:57:40,697
<b>1 minute and 50 seconds.</b>

618
00:57:40,721 --> 00:57:41,991
<b>Yes, that's enough time.</b>

619
00:57:42,652 --> 00:57:44,721
<b>You'll end up rotting in jail anyway.</b>

620
00:57:52,232 --> 00:57:53,431
<b>I ran away...</b>

621
00:57:54,201 --> 00:57:56,701
<b>after I saw Jin Jae Gyu at my house.</b>

622
00:57:57,971 --> 00:57:59,971
<b>I did what my husband told me to do.</b>

623
00:58:02,212 --> 00:58:03,412
<b>And I found my son in the car.</b>

624
00:58:06,741 --> 00:58:08,581
<b>He told me the only way to stay safe...</b>

625
00:58:09,282 --> 00:58:10,782
<b>is to get on a boat and leave.</b>

626
00:58:11,282 --> 00:58:13,882
<b>Ma'am, where's your husband?</b>

627
00:58:17,052 --> 00:58:18,991
<b>I agreed to meet him at
the Passenger Terminal.</b>

628
00:59:13,181 --> 00:59:14,811
<b>1 minute and 30 seconds.</b>

629
00:59:17,181 --> 00:59:18,752
<b>He has a knife.</b>

630
00:59:40,641 --> 00:59:43,141
<b>Wake up. I'll call an ambulance.</b>

631
01:00:05,761 --> 01:00:06,862
<b>Darn it!</b>

632
01:00:16,041 --> 01:00:17,311
<b>You even tried to harm the kid?</b>

633
01:00:25,882 --> 01:00:27,022
<b>You failed.</b>

634
01:00:27,681 --> 01:00:29,391
<b>The mother and son are safe.</b>

635
01:00:31,721 --> 01:00:32,791
<b>What?</b>

636
01:00:33,221 --> 01:00:34,962
<b>We found them before they left the country.</b>

637
01:00:37,192 --> 01:00:38,261
<b>What?</b>

638
01:00:40,232 --> 01:00:41,272
<b>What did you say?</b>

639
01:00:42,632 --> 01:00:43,632
<b>Are you upset?</b>

640
01:00:44,902 --> 01:00:45,971
<b>No.</b>

641
01:00:46,502 --> 01:00:48,311
<b>No, wait.</b>

642
01:00:48,772 --> 01:00:49,942
<b>Something's weird.</b>

643
01:00:50,411 --> 01:00:52,041
<b>Something feels weird. Wait.</b>

644
01:00:52,212 --> 01:00:53,241
<b>Wait a minute.</b>

645
01:00:53,842 --> 01:00:55,081
<b>No.</b>

646
01:01:01,552 --> 01:01:02,621
<b>(Come back.)</b>

647
01:01:04,962 --> 01:01:07,322
<b>No. No.</b>

648
01:01:09,232 --> 01:01:10,331
<b>Listen to me.</b>

649
01:01:11,362 --> 01:01:13,831
<b>You're the only one who can
protect Sang Ha and Hyeon Su.</b>

650
01:01:16,132 --> 01:01:17,431
<b>Don't ever forget that.</b>

651
01:01:23,741 --> 01:01:26,882
<b>Sang Ha... Let her go.</b>

652
01:01:28,181 --> 01:01:29,311
<b>Let Sang Ha go.</b>

653
01:01:33,422 --> 01:01:34,482
<b>This guy...</b>

654
01:01:37,192 --> 01:01:38,512
<b>doesn't have supernatural powers.</b>

655
01:01:40,891 --> 01:01:42,132
<b>He tried to protect them.</b>

656
01:01:43,561 --> 01:01:44,881
<b>He tried to protect her family...</b>

657
01:01:47,532 --> 01:01:48,802
<b>from the actual murderer.</b>

658
01:01:49,732 --> 01:01:52,942
<b>He... He tried to protect
them from the Eraser.</b>

659
01:01:55,072 --> 01:01:56,172
<b>"The Eraser"?</b>

660
01:02:27,072 --> 01:02:28,342
<b>No!</b>

661
01:02:28,641 --> 01:02:30,612
<b>No! No!</b>

662
01:02:30,842 --> 01:02:33,882
<b>No!</b>

663
01:03:12,221 --> 01:03:15,322
<b>(Memorist)</b>

664
01:03:15,351 --> 01:03:17,022
<b>There was a mob violence 20 years ago.</b>

665
01:03:17,291 --> 01:03:19,161
<b>Don't trust Jin Jae Gyu's memories.</b>

666
01:03:19,561 --> 01:03:21,322
<b>I'm sure it happened.</b>

667
01:03:21,891 --> 01:03:23,232
<b>The culprit is someone else?</b>

668
01:03:25,232 --> 01:03:26,902
<b>You don't trust my memories.</b>

669
01:03:27,132 --> 01:03:29,048
<b>He was definitely someone
close to Jin Jae Gyu.</b>

670
01:03:29,072 --> 01:03:31,232
<b>- Are you sure?
- A black face.</b>

671
01:03:31,802 --> 01:03:32,878
<b>Red eyes.</b>

672
01:03:32,902 --> 01:03:34,418
<b>The guy who suffocated to death.</b>

673
01:03:34,442 --> 01:03:37,041
<b>The moment Jin Jae Gyu's
memory started disappearing.</b>

674
01:03:37,342 --> 01:03:39,112
<b>The moment the murderer first appeared.</b>

675
01:03:39,581 --> 01:03:40,581
<b>3,000?</b>
