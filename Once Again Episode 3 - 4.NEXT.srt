<b>Let's all raise a glass

4
00:00:07,222 --> 00:00:10,962
<b>- Cheers!
- Cheers!</b>

5
00:00:10,962 --> 00:00:14,103
<b>- Cheers.
- Cheers.</b>

6
00:00:14,103 --> 00:00:16,803
<b>- Cheers.
- Cheers.</b>

7
00:00:17,902 --> 00:00:20,742
<b>- Here comes more food.
- Great.</b>

8
00:00:20,742 --> 00:00:22,073
<b>Make some room.</b>

9
00:00:22,073 --> 00:00:23,313
<b>Mom.</b>

10
00:00:39,263 --> 00:00:42,392
<b>Ouch! That's so hot!</b>

11
00:00:42,392 --> 00:00:43,833
<b>Save me!</b>

12
00:00:44,593 --> 00:00:47,662
<b>- Oh, dear.
- Are you okay?</b>

13
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:51,760
<b>(Episode 3)</b>

14
00:00:52,729 --> 00:00:55,260
<b>My gosh,
what on earth just happened?</b>

15
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:57,500
<b>All except 1 of their 4 kids
have failed marriages?</b>

16
00:00:59,769 --> 00:01:01,070
<b>Maybe this house is cursed.</b>

17
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:03,869
<b>Should I suggest
some sort of exorcism?</b>

18
00:01:03,869 --> 00:01:05,269
<b>Why though?</b>

19
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:08,610
<b>You...</b>

20
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:11,810
<b>got married just several hours ago.</b>

21
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:15,479
<b>We waved you off
as you set out for your honeymoon.</b>

22
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:17,650
<b>Now you want an annulment?</b>

23
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:21,789
<b>Why on earth
would you bring this up?</b>

24
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,090
<b>Mom, it's...</b>

25
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:25,620
<b>Did you and Young Hoon
get into a fight?</b>

26
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,560
<b>Is that why...</b>

27
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:29,859
<b>you suddenly want to call it quits?</b>

28
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,399
<b>Stop interrupting her
and let her speak.</b>

29
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:35,630
<b>How can I when I'm this angry
and frustrated?</b>

30
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:39,539
<b>I don't think I can do this.</b>

31
00:01:39,639 --> 00:01:41,969
<b>I don't think
I can live with him forever.</b>

32
00:01:44,279 --> 00:01:45,310
<b>What?</b>

33
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,410
<b>Are you kidding me right now?</b>

34
00:01:48,649 --> 00:01:50,179
<b>Marriage isn't a game, you know.</b>

35
00:01:50,179 --> 00:01:52,789
<b>You can't say that
after walking down the aisle.</b>

36
00:01:53,149 --> 00:01:55,119
<b>My gosh. This must be a joke.</b>

37
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:58,559
<b>I thought she was the sweet one,
but look at what she has done.</b>

38
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:03,399
<b>Is she seriously throwing a tantrum?</b>

39
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:05,429
<b>Honey, keep it down!</b>

40
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:08,300
<b>There's no need to
yell at her like that.</b>

41
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:11,140
<b>How can I not raise my voice?</b>

42
00:02:13,839 --> 00:02:14,910
<b>Whatever.</b>

43
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:19,009
<b>If this happened
because of an argument,</b>

44
00:02:19,009 --> 00:02:21,850
<b>go back to him and apologize.</b>

45
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,819
<b>Ask for his forgiveness
and calm him down.</b>

46
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:26,319
<b>No.</b>

47
00:02:27,449 --> 00:02:28,690
<b>What?</b>

48
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,089
<b>This isn't because I'm angry.</b>

49
00:02:31,789 --> 00:02:33,589
<b>It's over for us, Mom.</b>

50
00:02:35,259 --> 00:02:37,600
<b>What will you do
if it really is over?</b>

51
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,800
<b>The food we ate at the wedding
hasn't even been digested, you brat.</b>

52
00:02:40,899 --> 00:02:42,899
<b>What about our guests
who came to the wedding?</b>

53
00:02:42,899 --> 00:02:44,440
<b>What about our relatives?</b>

54
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,009
<b>Da Hee, look.</b>

55
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,910
<b>I say this from experience.</b>

56
00:02:55,949 --> 00:02:57,620
<b>This is how marriage is.</b>

57
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,750
<b>You argue...</b>

58
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,519
<b>and consider calling it quits,</b>

59
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,190
<b>but you still keep going.</b>

60
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:06,930
<b>Quarrels between married couples
never last.</b>

61
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:12,130
<b>I'm sure that Young Hoon
is waiting for you to call.</b>

62
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:15,400
<b>Why don't we get him
on the phone first?</b>

63
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,199
<b>Yes, that sounds like a good idea.</b>

64
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:20,410
<b>I'll try to appease his anger,</b>

65
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:22,410
<b>so talk to him and...</b>

66
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,539
<b>No.</b>

67
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:27,380
<b>I'm done, Mom.</b>

68
00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:28,850
<b>But Da Hee.</b>

69
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:32,949
<b>What do you mean, you're done?
What will you do now?</b>

70
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:35,220
<b>What are you going to do, you brat?</b>

71
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,460
<b>Just what...</b>

72
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,560
<b>- Mom, no!
- Stop hitting her.</b>

73
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,960
<b>- Mom, don't.
- Let go!</b>

74
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,030
<b>How dare you humiliate us like this?</b>

75
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:45,329
<b>- Mom...
- How dare you!</b>

76
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:47,569
<b>- Don't get physical, Mom.
- How dare you.</b>

77
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,039
<b>It's not like I'm asking for much.</b>

78
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,440
<b>All I want is for you
to have an ordinary life.</b>

79
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,380
<b>Is that really so hard to do
for all of you?</b>

80
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:02,150
<b>Is it nice to see
your brother and sister...</b>

81
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,720
<b>live back at home
after failing their marriages?</b>

82
00:04:03,949 --> 00:04:07,019
<b>Is that why you're
following in their footsteps?</b>

83
00:04:08,889 --> 00:04:11,919
<b>Honey, please.
Kids, take her outside.</b>

84
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,630
<b>Here. Da Hee, get up.
Take her outside.</b>

85
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,930
<b>Come on. Let's go.</b>

86
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,199
<b>- I...
- My gosh.</b>

87
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,699
<b>Darn it!</b>

88
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:22,900
<b>No wonder I had...</b>

89
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,900
<b>this odd feeling in my stomach
during the ceremony.</b>

90
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,509
<b>How could she do this to me too?</b>

91
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:31,410
<b>Three of my kids
hammered a nail into my chest.</b>

92
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:34,310
<b>One after one, again and again!</b>

93
00:04:34,509 --> 00:04:37,380
<b>What did I ever do to deserve this?</b>

94
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,220
<b>What did I even do wrong?</b>

95
00:04:40,819 --> 00:04:41,989
<b>What...</b>

96
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,220
<b>- Mom?
- Mom!</b>

97
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,919
<b>Dad, something is wrong with mom.</b>

98
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,889
<b>Are you all right?
Honey, look at me.</b>

99
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:49,960
<b>My gosh, hold on.</b>

100
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,400
<b>Mom...</b>

101
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,470
<b>- Dad, hurry.
- Hurry!</b>

102
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,539
<b>Here you go. Now breathe.</b>

103
00:04:56,539 --> 00:04:58,900
<b>Come on, 1, 2...</b>

104
00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:11,580
<b>How can you cause this mess
on the day of your wedding?</b>

105
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,820
<b>Na Hee, I'd rather talk tomorrow.</b>

106
00:05:15,689 --> 00:05:17,590
<b>I want to get some rest.</b>

107
00:05:18,689 --> 00:05:21,859
<b>How does this even make sense?</b>

108
00:05:21,859 --> 00:05:24,229
<b>I'd have the same reaction
as Mom as well.</b>

109
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,570
<b>Aren't you old enough
to know what's important?</b>

110
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:30,770
<b>Where's your
sense of responsibility?</b>

111
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:32,499
<b>Is this a joke to you?</b>

112
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:35,210
<b>Are you insane?
Gosh, how stupid are you?</b>

113
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,479
<b>That's right. I'm a fool, okay?</b>

114
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:40,580
<b>I caused this mess because
I'm not as smart as you.</b>

115
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,850
<b>It's why I voiced
my uncertainty at first.</b>

116
00:05:43,419 --> 00:05:44,919
<b>I didn't know if I loved him...</b>

117
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,390
<b>and marriage seemed
like a hasty decision.</b>

118
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:49,789
<b>But Mom said I should marry him
before he changes his mind.</b>

119
00:05:49,789 --> 00:05:52,720
<b>Then you should've been adamant
about what you want.</b>

120
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,830
<b>In the end, this was your choice.</b>

121
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,999
<b>Why say otherwise
when you went along with it?</b>

122
00:05:57,129 --> 00:05:58,760
<b>Take responsibility
for your own actions...</b>

123
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,200
<b>and don't be a fool!</b>

124
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,200
<b>You're right. I'm a fool.</b>

125
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,770
<b>I hate that about myself too,
you know.</b>

126
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:08,270
<b>Everything you said is true,
so please stop yelling at me.</b>

127
00:06:10,109 --> 00:06:12,809
<b>How dare you yell at me
when you're the one to blame?</b>

128
00:06:13,049 --> 00:06:15,280
<b>Da Hee, come on.</b>

129
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,950
<b>Must you be like that
when she's obviously in pain?</b>

130
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:20,049
<b>- Get out.
- But I'm not done yet.</b>

131
00:06:20,049 --> 00:06:22,419
<b>Shut up and leave!</b>

132
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:26,789
<b>This is why they say
it's better not to have kids.</b>

133
00:06:26,789 --> 00:06:28,929
<b>No wonder why I don't want to marry.</b>

134
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:34,499
<b>What? I can't let it go to waste.</b>

135
00:06:34,499 --> 00:06:37,270
<b>It'll cost more money
to throw out all the food.</b>

136
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:41,410
<b>Go ahead. Someone should eat this.</b>

137
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:43,410
<b>- Sorry?
- Here you go.</b>

138
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:46,179
<b>Oh, right. Sure.</b>

139
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:50,780
<b>Get out here.</b>

140
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:53,720
<b>Unbelievable.</b>

141
00:06:55,419 --> 00:06:56,520
<b>Is Da Hee all right?</b>

142
00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:01,090
<b>This is how
it's going to be all night.</b>

143
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,229
<b>You should head home
and leave this to us.</b>

144
00:07:04,229 --> 00:07:06,030
<b>Don't you have work tomorrow?</b>

145
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:17,410
<b>I wonder if your mom
will be all right.</b>

146
00:07:17,609 --> 00:07:19,239
<b>She seemed more than shocked.</b>

147
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:26,080
<b>Da Hee can be quite odd sometimes.</b>

148
00:07:26,419 --> 00:07:31,119
<b>Your brother and older sister
are usually loud anyway,</b>

149
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,989
<b>but Da Hee is more the quiet type.</b>

150
00:07:35,359 --> 00:07:36,499
<b>An annulment?</b>

151
00:07:38,999 --> 00:07:40,400
<b>I guess...</b>

152
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:44,470
<b>the quieter ones
do cause bigger issues though.</b>

153
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:47,439
<b>They usually keep all their emotions
bottled up inside...</b>

154
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:50,109
<b>so when that bottle
finally pops open... Bang!</b>

155
00:07:50,109 --> 00:07:51,679
<b>Gyu Jin, come on.</b>

156
00:07:52,679 --> 00:07:53,710
<b>What?</b>

157
00:07:54,609 --> 00:07:57,950
<b>Keep it down, will you?
I have enough of a headache.</b>

158
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,150
<b>Right, I understand.</b>

159
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:05,820
<b>I need water.</b>

160
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:12,799
<b>Ga Hee, it's me. How's Mom?
Is she lying down?</b>

161
00:08:13,499 --> 00:08:15,970
<b>Will she even
be able to sleep tonight?</b>

162
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,299
<b>How's Da Hee?</b>

163
00:08:18,169 --> 00:08:19,840
<b>No sane person...</b>

164
00:08:19,869 --> 00:08:21,539
<b>- would be able to sleep.
- Soccer...</b>

165
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,439
<b>I'm upset, that's why.</b>

166
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:26,910
<b>- Pass!
- Gosh, this is bad.</b>

167
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,150
<b>Ga Hee, hold on.</b>

168
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,749
<b>Can't you see that I'm on the phone?</b>

169
00:08:30,749 --> 00:08:31,879
<b>- What?
- Turn it off.</b>

170
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:33,650
<b>- Right, of course.
- Son Heung Min passes the ball.</b>

171
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:34,850
<b>- Son Heung Min makes a run.
- Right.</b>

172
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:35,919
<b>To the inside.</b>

173
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,289
<b>- Son Heung Min shoots.
- Shoot!</b>

174
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:39,520
<b>- Ga Hee, I'll call you back.
- Unbelievable.</b>

175
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,789
<b>You call that a pass?</b>

176
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:43,460
<b>It hit the goal post...</b>

177
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:47,700
<b>What on earth are you doing?
Son Heung Min was playing.</b>

178
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,770
<b>That's what I should be asking.</b>

179
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:52,200
<b>Your sister-in-law
came home on her wedding night,</b>

180
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,939
<b>and you're watching soccer?</b>

181
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:57,080
<b>You say you're family too.
That's what you say to my mom.</b>

182
00:08:57,439 --> 00:08:59,910
<b>What am I supposed to do?</b>

183
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:02,350
<b>Should I dive under my covers
and cry like Da Hee too?</b>

184
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:04,679
<b>Or maybe I should
get down on my knees...</b>

185
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:06,020
<b>and pray for everything
to get better.</b>

186
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,989
<b>I don't appreciate your sarcasm.</b>

187
00:09:08,789 --> 00:09:11,119
<b>And I know you look down
on my family.</b>

188
00:09:11,119 --> 00:09:13,489
<b>I know what you think
about Joon Seon and Ga Hee.</b>

189
00:09:13,489 --> 00:09:16,229
<b>You think less of them
because they're divorced, don't you?</b>

190
00:09:16,229 --> 00:09:19,129
<b>Why must you get
all sensitive like this?</b>

191
00:09:19,129 --> 00:09:21,600
<b>It's not like your family
is any better.</b>

192
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:23,739
<b>Look at today for instance.</b>

193
00:09:23,739 --> 00:09:27,139
<b>What on earth is wrong
with your mother?</b>

194
00:09:27,139 --> 00:09:29,670
<b>If she's running late,
she could've sent you over first.</b>

195
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,580
<b>Why can't your mom
take a taxi like a normal person?</b>

196
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,879
<b>Unbelievable. Must you be so crude?</b>

197
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:37,879
<b>No one talks like that
about their mother-in-law.</b>

198
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:40,649
<b>Why not? It's not like
she's my mother, is she?</b>

199
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:45,389
<b>Fine, whatever.
Talking to you is too exhausting.</b>

200
00:09:45,389 --> 00:09:47,430
<b>Let's just drop it.</b>

201
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:51,499
<b>You're going to watch soccer,
aren't you?</b>

202
00:09:51,499 --> 00:09:53,970
<b>As if. I won't, okay?</b>

203
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:56,899
<b>Take the remote control with you
if you want to.</b>

204
00:09:56,899 --> 00:09:59,540
<b>I won't turn it on. Go ahead.</b>

205
00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:05,340
<b>It doesn't mean that
you should really take it with you!</b>

206
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:09,479
<b>Gosh, she can be so
so catty sometimes.</b>

207
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:13,119
<b>Darn him.</b>

208
00:10:21,259 --> 00:10:23,499
<b>(Da Hee's wedding,
ovulation)</b>

209
00:10:31,869 --> 00:10:33,139
<b>Shoot!</b>

210
00:10:33,139 --> 00:10:35,409
<b>However, it hit the goal post.</b>

211
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:41,909
<b>Wash up.</b>

212
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:43,920
<b>Forget it. Let me be.</b>

213
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:48,149
<b>- Go and wash up.
- Stop it.</b>

214
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:51,690
<b>Do I need your permission
to wash up and shower now?</b>

215
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:54,229
<b>Are you my mom?
Should I call you that, Mom?</b>

216
00:10:54,889 --> 00:10:56,800
<b>Fine, then just
take off your clothes.</b>

217
00:10:58,499 --> 00:10:59,499
<b>What?</b>

218
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:01,430
<b>What did you just say?</b>

219
00:11:01,529 --> 00:11:03,269
<b>I've started to ovulate.</b>

220
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:05,269
<b>I already knew this morning,</b>

221
00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:07,369
<b>but forgot because
of the mess Da Hee caused.</b>

222
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:09,710
<b>Still, I'm glad you didn't drink.</b>

223
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:12,580
<b>Are you serious?</b>

224
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:15,050
<b>We were arguing
just about a second ago.</b>

225
00:11:15,149 --> 00:11:17,619
<b>It's a temporary truce
due to an emergency situation.</b>

226
00:11:17,619 --> 00:11:19,050
<b>We don't have time,
so let's get this over with.</b>

227
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:21,320
<b>Hold on. Wait a second.</b>

228
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:25,060
<b>You may be able
to control your emotions like that,</b>

229
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,460
<b>but I can't. I really can't.</b>

230
00:11:27,889 --> 00:11:30,029
<b>Let's not be like amateurs.</b>

231
00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:33,159
<b>No one said anything about emotions.
This is only physical.</b>

232
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:36,029
<b>Wait, don't come any closer.</b>

233
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,109
<b>How can you say that
without batting an eye?</b>

234
00:11:41,109 --> 00:11:43,810
<b>Have you no shame at all?
This isn't homework, you know.</b>

235
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:45,109
<b>Just shut it, okay?</b>

236
00:11:45,109 --> 00:11:48,710
<b>I'm just letting you know of
your physiological duty to perform.</b>

237
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,820
<b>Just come here.</b>

238
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:56,119
<b>Like you said,
just think of it as doing homework.</b>

239
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:58,090
<b>Hang on.</b>

240
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:00,190
<b>I'm going to shout. Don't do that.</b>

241
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:01,259
<b>Stop it.</b>

242
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:04,330
<b>Don't do this to me.</b>

243
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:07,200
<b>We're doing it anyway.
Don't waste your energy.</b>

244
00:12:08,999 --> 00:12:10,940
<b>Stop it. Don't do that.</b>

245
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:14,239
<b>Hey! Stop right there, Gyu Jin.</b>

246
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:18,580
<b>Gyu Jin, open it.
Aren't you going to open it?</b>

247
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:20,979
<b>I will never open it.</b>

248
00:12:20,979 --> 00:12:24,149
<b>You're so... You know what?
I have my own principles.</b>

249
00:12:24,149 --> 00:12:25,220
<b>I'm not opening it.</b>

250
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:28,720
<b>Come on out while I'm being nice
unless you want to see blood.</b>

251
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,190
<b>Hey, just give up.</b>

252
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:33,659
<b>You'll never lay
a finger on me tonight.</b>

253
00:12:33,659 --> 00:12:36,330
<b>We don't have time.
Just open the door.</b>

254
00:12:37,659 --> 00:12:38,960
<b>Hey, Gyu Jin!</b>

255
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,700
<b>Open up before I count to three.</b>

256
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,529
<b>Otherwise, I'll smash down the door.</b>

257
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:43,869
<b>One.</b>

258
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:45,200
<b>Two.</b>

259
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,210
<b>Hey, have it your way.
There's no way I'm opening it.</b>

260
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:50,909
<b>I'll never open the door.</b>

261
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,320
<b>Mom. Mom!</b>

262
00:13:02,119 --> 00:13:03,720
<b>Mom.</b>

263
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,820
<b>Come and take a look at this.</b>

264
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,090
<b>Hurry and come on out.</b>

265
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,600
<b>Gosh, that was quick.</b>

266
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,869
<b>It's as if he was afraid
she'd want to get back together.</b>

267
00:13:13,869 --> 00:13:15,700
<b>Gosh, it hurts.</b>

268
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,670
<b>I guess he's just
trying to scare her.</b>

269
00:13:22,909 --> 00:13:24,909
<b>Hey, where are you going?</b>

270
00:13:24,909 --> 00:13:26,180
<b>I'm going to work.</b>

271
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,850
<b>My colleague is taking care
of my work now.</b>

272
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:29,979
<b>I should go.</b>

273
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:33,619
<b>Are you going to work? Now?</b>

274
00:13:33,619 --> 00:13:34,720
<b>You.</b>

275
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:36,249
<b>Come with me.</b>

276
00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:38,489
<b>Mom, I have to go.</b>

277
00:13:38,489 --> 00:13:40,889
<b>I got a text message that we have
an issue with a group tour.</b>

278
00:13:40,889 --> 00:13:43,659
<b>Just come with me before I have you
erased from our family register.</b>

279
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:45,600
<b>Mom, please.</b>

280
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:48,470
<b>Gosh, that naive fool.</b>

281
00:13:48,629 --> 00:13:50,129
<b>I'm so tired.</b>

282
00:13:53,369 --> 00:13:54,470
<b>You're out of your mind.</b>

283
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,470
<b>How can you go to work
at a time like this?</b>

284
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:59,509
<b>Why not just go around
and tell people...</b>

285
00:13:59,509 --> 00:14:01,379
<b>that you called off your marriage?</b>

286
00:14:01,379 --> 00:14:03,279
<b>No one is that interested
in me anyway.</b>

287
00:14:03,379 --> 00:14:05,619
<b>And people will find out eventually.</b>

288
00:14:05,619 --> 00:14:07,720
<b>Do you seriously want a beating
or something?</b>

289
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,759
<b>Madam Jang. Why use violence?
This isn't like you.</b>

290
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:14,029
<b>He's right. Let's talk it out
like cultured people.</b>

291
00:14:14,529 --> 00:14:16,359
<b>Da Hee. You're not seriously
going to work, are you?</b>

292
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:19,560
<b>You just said that because
you were frustrated, right?</b>

293
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:23,940
<b>See? Mom, silence means yes.</b>

294
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,239
<b>She was just frustrated.
Calm down and have a seat.</b>

295
00:14:26,239 --> 00:14:27,940
<b>Please. You have
high blood pressure.</b>

296
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,670
<b>I'm afraid you might collapse.</b>

297
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:30,810
<b>Let go of me.</b>

298
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,109
<b>Don't play the hypocrite.</b>

299
00:14:32,109 --> 00:14:34,479
<b>You are the ones who raised
my blood pressure.</b>

300
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:38,979
<b>I'm going out for a moment.</b>

301
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:43,560
<b>You guys make sure
that she stays in her room.</b>

302
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:47,359
<b>If she gets out of her room,
I'll kick you guys out of the house.</b>

303
00:14:47,359 --> 00:14:49,759
<b>Gosh, Mom. Why would you say
such scary things?</b>

<b>Did you call it a show?</b>

<b>Yes, I did. It's not the first time

<b>"I'm in pain."</b>

<b>It's true she is eccentric,

<b>But how can you say that
your mother-in-law puts on a show?</b>

<b>That's just fact. Am I wrong?</b>

<b>No. You're right.
You always state the correct facts.</b>

<b>You always focus on the facts.
Do you know how sickening that is?</b>

<b>No, don't say that we suffer.
You're the one who suffers.</b>

<b>I keep trying

558

<b>Do you think I'm doing this

<b>Do you even want to

<b>Na Hee. Must we do this
to maintain our marriage?</b>

564

<b>At the cost of forcing

<b>That's how desperate I am.</b>

<b>Do you think doing this

<b>- What?
- What did I tell you?</b>

572
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,770
<b>I told you to skip the conference

577
00:30:12,879 --> 00:30:14,050
<b>So,</b>

578
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:19,760

579
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:21,020
<b>No.</b>

580
00:30:21,159 --> 00:30:22,590
<b>Is that why you avoided me?</b>

581
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:26,060
<b>No, Na Hee, listen to me.</b>

582
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:27,429
<b>I get it.</b>

583

<b>and when you...</b>

608
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,570
<b>insisted on working part-time...</b>

609
00:32:15,639 --> 00:32:17,340
<b>during your senior year
in high school.</b>

610
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:19,810
<b>That's right.</b>

611
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:23,949
<b>I'm sure you have
a good reason this time too.</b>

612
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,219
<b>I'm sure of it.</b>

613
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:29,050
<b>Still,</b>

614
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:32,020
<b>know this though.</b>

615
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:35,030
<b>It will pass.</b>

616
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:37,830
<b>Once time passes,</b>

617
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:42,199
<b>what seemed serious
will turn out not to be.</b>

618
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:44,030
<b>It's true.</b>

619
00:32:46,669 --> 00:32:48,369
<b>Life is a marathon.</b>

620
00:32:49,609 --> 00:32:50,869
<b>You know,</b>

621
00:32:51,379 --> 00:32:54,240
<b>sometimes you cry,
sometimes you laugh.</b>

622
00:32:55,109 --> 00:32:56,850
<b>So what if you have
to shed tears this time?</b>

623
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,980
<b>You have your mom and dad...</b>

624
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,219
<b>and also your siblings.</b>

625
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,790
<b>You have so many people
in your corner.</b>

626
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:12,060
<b>Dad!</b>

627
00:33:15,369 --> 00:33:17,669
<b>It's all right. It's okay, Da Hee.</b>

628
00:34:15,689 --> 00:34:18,500
<b>Look at the facial features
of our baby.</b>

629
00:34:18,699 --> 00:34:21,330
<b>You must take after your dad.</b>

630
00:34:21,669 --> 00:34:23,100
<b>Don't be ridiculous.</b>

631
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,939
<b>It's not big enough
to have facial features.</b>

632
00:34:24,939 --> 00:34:28,310
<b>Well, they're visible to me.</b>

633
00:34:28,909 --> 00:34:32,540
<b>Shouldn't we tell my mom
and your parents though?</b>

634
00:34:33,209 --> 00:34:35,709
<b>I will once I get back
from this seminar.</b>

635
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,219
<b>Na Hee,</b>

636
00:34:39,379 --> 00:34:42,449
<b>shouldn't you go to sleep?
It's past 1 a.m.</b>

637
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,790
<b>Go to sleep without me.
I need to wrap this up first.</b>

638
00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:49,090
<b>This is why I told you
not to attend this seminar.</b>

639
00:34:49,429 --> 00:34:52,199
<b>Mi Jin said you should be careful...</b>

640
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:54,560
<b>since you have
a thin uterine lining.</b>

641
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,399
<b>She's only trying to scare me.</b>

642
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:57,730
<b>You know what she's like.</b>

643
00:34:57,830 --> 00:34:59,299
<b>Still.</b>

644
00:34:59,299 --> 00:35:00,339
<b>Honey,</b>

645
00:35:00,869 --> 00:35:02,339
<b>I need to wrap this up quickly.</b>

646
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:04,540
<b>If you want to help,
go to sleep first.</b>

647
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,750
<b>Don't take too long.</b>

648
00:35:10,449 --> 00:35:11,480
<b>Blood.</b>

649
00:35:11,779 --> 00:35:13,920
<b>That's odd.
I stopped all the bleeding.</b>

650
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,420
<b>Did you get hurt anywhere else?</b>

651
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:17,690
<b>You're the one who's bleeding.</b>

652
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:22,159
<b>Na Hee, what's wrong?</b>

653
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:25,130
<b>Hurry. Call an ambulance. Na Hee!</b>

654
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:03,080
<b>(Episode 4)</b>

655
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,220
<b>Gosh.</b>

656
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:10,980
<b>Yes, Mom.</b>

657
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:14,519
<b>Gyu Jin, I called to get an earful.</b>

658
00:36:14,519 --> 00:36:15,760
<b>I'm sorry about yesterday.</b>

659
00:36:16,089 --> 00:36:19,589
<b>I was only going to drink
some from my own bottle.</b>

660
00:36:20,989 --> 00:36:22,030
<b>But you know how I am.</b>

661
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:24,600
<b>- I can't help myself...
- And you still drank?</b>

662
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:30,170
<b>Mom, you shouldn't
have taken the first sip.</b>

663
00:36:30,439 --> 00:36:33,939
<b>Why is that?
Did your wife say something?</b>

664
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,679
<b>Did you argue because of me?</b>

665
00:36:36,009 --> 00:36:37,140
<b>No, of course not.</b>

666
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:40,450
<b>- Did you have breakfast?
- Yes.</b>

667
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:43,049
<b>I see you made bean sprout soup.</b>

668
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,820
<b>It wasn't well-seasoned though.
I found it bland.</b>

669
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:50,820
<b>You're unbelievable, Mom.</b>

670
00:36:51,159 --> 00:36:53,689
<b>- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.</b>

671
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,729
<b>Doctor!</b>

672
00:36:56,729 --> 00:36:59,799
<b>My gosh, Yoon Hoo.
It's good to see you.</b>

673
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,900
<b>What's this?
Look at how well your arm is.</b>

674
00:37:03,069 --> 00:37:04,069
<b>Are you all good now?</b>

675
00:37:04,069 --> 00:37:05,939
<b>- Yes.
- Me too!</b>

676
00:37:06,209 --> 00:37:08,840
<b>Si Yoon, yes, of course.</b>

677
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,209
<b>Why don't I take you
on a plane ride?</b>

678
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:18,549
<b>Guys,</b>

679
00:37:18,549 --> 00:37:21,150
<b>we'll meet again
when you're even better.</b>

680
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:22,659
<b>- All right.
- Good.</b>

681
00:37:23,189 --> 00:37:24,560
<b>Bye, Si Yoon.</b>

682
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,430
<b>- Bye.
- Bye.</b>

683
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:28,090
<b>Bye, guys.</b>

684
00:37:28,799 --> 00:37:29,829
<b>Bye!</b>

685
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:46,909
<b>Tteokbokki, again?</b>

686
00:37:46,909 --> 00:37:48,150
<b>We'll go once we finish this.</b>

687
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:52,590
<b>Let's go then...</b>

688
00:37:52,819 --> 00:37:55,489
<b>Let me check my schedule first.</b>

689
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:02,099
<b>We were once like that too.</b>

690
00:38:14,879 --> 00:38:18,580
<b>We were happy to just be together
and so in love.</b>

691
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:20,610
<b>The good days.</b>

692
00:38:23,419 --> 00:38:25,090
<b>Let's sit here.</b>

693
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,759
<b>I can't. Dr. Jung just called.
I need to go.</b>

694
00:38:29,759 --> 00:38:31,189
<b>I have something to give you.</b>

695
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:32,659
<b>Ta-da!</b>

696
00:38:33,659 --> 00:38:35,300
<b>You said you were exhausted...</b>

697
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,930
<b>because you couldn't get
much sleep in the past few days.</b>

698
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,270
<b>But you also said
that sugar gives you energy.</b>

699
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:42,539
<b>Gyu Jin, I'm touched.</b>

700
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:48,810
<b>What if other people see us?
Are you sure we can be this bold?</b>

701
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:50,680
<b>I'd like them to see us...</b>

702
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,080
<b>so that we can get caught.</b>

703
00:38:55,379 --> 00:38:59,020
<b>Why? Am I too sexy?
Having trouble staying away?</b>

704
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:12,629
<b>Wait, someone saw us!</b>

705
00:39:12,629 --> 00:39:14,800
<b>What? Gosh, you startled me.</b>

706
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,400
<b>I nearly had a heart attack!</b>

707
00:39:17,439 --> 00:39:20,310
<b>You have no idea how shocked I was.</b>

708
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:22,439
<b>The light,</b>

709
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:25,479
<b>the heat, the ticklish sensations...</b>

710
00:39:26,879 --> 00:39:28,719
<b>I wonder where they all went.</b>

711
00:39:31,849 --> 00:39:34,120
<b><i>Hit the big drum</i></b>

712
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,620
<b><i>Tap on the small drum</i></b>

713
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:41,030
<b><i>Play the xylophone</i></b>

714
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:43,830
<b>Nice!</b>

715
00:39:44,659 --> 00:39:47,030
<b>Seo Jin, would you like
to try the guitar this time?</b>

716
00:39:54,169 --> 00:39:55,240
<b>Na Hee.</b>

717
00:39:55,879 --> 00:39:57,139
<b>Hi, Hyun Gyung.</b>

718
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:00,009
<b>Oh, you must be here
for Seo Jin's play therapy.</b>

719
00:40:00,009 --> 00:40:02,120
<b>Yes, her dad is
playing with her today.</b>

720
00:40:02,719 --> 00:40:04,520
<b>I came out here
to get something to drink.</b>

721
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:05,889
<b>I see.</b>

722
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:11,759
<b>Could I perhaps buy you that drink?</b>

723
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:13,159
<b>Sorry?</b>

724
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:17,060
<b>Mother must be going crazy.</b>

725
00:40:17,259 --> 00:40:18,629
<b>Because of Da Hee, I mean.</b>

726
00:40:19,899 --> 00:40:20,930
<b>Right.</b>

727
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:23,740
<b>My mom just has
terrible luck with her kids.</b>

728
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:27,439
<b>I wasn't referring to
you and Joon Seon,</b>

729
00:40:27,439 --> 00:40:28,639
<b>so please don't get the wrong idea.</b>

730
00:40:29,879 --> 00:40:31,540
<b>We did hurt her in many ways.</b>

731
00:40:32,209 --> 00:40:33,579
<b>That much is true.</b>

732
00:40:37,879 --> 00:40:39,689
<b>I bet it's hard
teaching kids to write essays.</b>

733
00:40:40,449 --> 00:40:42,620
<b>It's not easy going
from house to house either.</b>

734
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:44,120
<b>You have no idea.</b>

735
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,459
<b>When I have back to back classes,</b>

736
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:47,589
<b>I barely have time
to go to the bathroom let alone eat.</b>

737
00:40:47,889 --> 00:40:51,199
<b>My stomach is never at ease
and my bladder is suffering.</b>

738
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,829
<b>This is a surprise though.</b>

739
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,500
<b>You're not the type
to play hooky like this.</b>

740
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,509
<b>You caught me off guard.</b>

741
00:41:01,269 --> 00:41:02,480
<b>Is that so?</b>

742
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:07,209
<b>Hyun Gyung,</b>

743
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:09,480
<b>could I ask you something?</b>

744
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,550
<b>Of course,
there was a reason behind this.</b>

745
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:14,819
<b>Go ahead and ask.</b>

746
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:17,560
<b>Why did you...</b>

747
00:41:18,259 --> 00:41:20,230
<b>divorce my brother?</b>

748
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:22,660
<b>Was it because he lost the house?</b>

749
00:41:25,629 --> 00:41:28,129
<b>I guess that made me
pull the trigger,</b>

750
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:30,370
<b>but...</b>

751
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:33,110
<b>I guess I was unhappy.</b>

752
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:36,879
<b>You know how sweet your brother is.</b>

753
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:40,680
<b>While we were dating,
that was what I loved about him.</b>

754
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:42,420
<b>After marriage though,</b>

755
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:44,420
<b>that also became
what I didn't like about him.</b>

756
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,189
<b>He would lend his friends money
and guarantee others' debts.</b>

757
00:41:47,589 --> 00:41:49,089
<b>That was hard enough,</b>

758
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:50,819
<b>but then he'd often
come home injured.</b>

759
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:55,500
<b>He had major surgery
after Seo Young was born,</b>

760
00:41:56,529 --> 00:41:58,129
<b>and I couldn't stop worrying.</b>

761
00:41:59,329 --> 00:42:02,470
<b>I lost my parents
at such an early age...</b>

762
00:42:03,769 --> 00:42:05,910
<b>and I didn't want to lose
someone else close to me.</b>

763
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:14,449
<b>Do you know what I loved the most
after getting divorced?</b>

764
00:42:15,949 --> 00:42:19,149
<b>I didn't have to hate him anymore.</b>

765
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:22,560
<b>That feeling was the best.</b>

766
00:42:27,129 --> 00:42:30,160
<b>Why did you suddenly
ask me that though?</b>

767
00:42:50,519 --> 00:42:52,250
<b>The person you called
is unavailable.</b>

768
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:55,459
<b>Please leave a message
after the beep.</b>

769
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,089
<b>- Extra fees...
- Got it.</b>

770
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:00,589
<b>Sure thing.
I'll see you later tonight, Yeo Jin.</b>

771
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:02,930
<b>Young Hoon!</b>

772
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:16,680
<b>Goodness. What's going on?</b>

773
00:43:17,139 --> 00:43:19,350
<b>You have no idea
how shocked I was...</b>

774
00:43:19,350 --> 00:43:21,209
<b>to see Da Hee come home.</b>

775
00:43:21,579 --> 00:43:24,620
<b>It was as if I saw a ghost
and I couldn't believe my eyes.</b>

776
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:27,420
<b>I've been shaking like a tree.</b>

777
00:43:29,689 --> 00:43:31,560
<b>Didn't Da Hee tell you?</b>

778
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,290
<b>She won't say why.</b>

779
00:43:33,389 --> 00:43:35,930
<b>All she said is that
you two decided to call it quits.</b>

780
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:37,930
<b>What kind of parent...</b>

781
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:40,269
<b>would be able to accept this?
You know?</b>

782
00:43:41,899 --> 00:43:42,899
<b>I see.</b>

783
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,269
<b>Of course.</b>

784
00:43:46,069 --> 00:43:48,040
<b>Marriage isn't easy.</b>

785
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:51,379
<b>There are many things to
worry about and it's exhausting.</b>

786
00:43:51,779 --> 00:43:53,379
<b>I hear that...</b>

787
00:43:53,579 --> 00:43:55,449
<b>many couples fight
on their honeymoons...</b>

788
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:57,620
<b>due to all the pent-up stress.</b>

789
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:00,290
<b>Still,</b>

790
00:44:00,519 --> 00:44:03,319
<b>you should try to
talk it out between you.</b>

791
00:44:03,319 --> 00:44:04,920
<b>This is just wrong.</b>

792
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:09,730
<b>An annulment is out of the question.</b>

793
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:12,569
<b>Mother.</b>

794
00:44:12,569 --> 00:44:14,870
<b>Yes, of course.</b>

795
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:17,300
<b>Go ahead.
I'm sorry for talking too much.</b>

796
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:18,639
<b>You go ahead.</b>

797
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:21,240
<b>Please don't try too hard.</b>

798
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:23,579
<b>We're just not compatible
in many ways.</b>

799
00:44:23,579 --> 00:44:26,550
<b>All marriages
get off to a rocky start.</b>

800
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:28,449
<b>You're supposed
to build marriages too.</b>

801
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:32,220
<b>I know that Da Hee is indecisive
and foolishly kind.</b>

802
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:36,320
<b>She even frustrates me too,
you know.</b>

803
00:44:37,690 --> 00:44:39,429
<b>She's quite stubborn too.</b>

804
00:44:39,429 --> 00:44:41,929
<b>Yes, she is.</b>

805
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,399
<b>Don't I know it.</b>

806
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:46,830
<b>She's tactless too.</b>

807
00:44:47,470 --> 00:44:50,139
<b>She seemed awkward around my mother,</b>

808
00:44:50,139 --> 00:44:52,309
<b>so I took her home
so that they can bond.</b>

809
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:53,940
<b>But...</b>

810
00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:55,940
<b>Unbelievable.</b>

811
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:59,509
<b>Instead of trying
to get along with my mom,</b>

812
00:44:59,809 --> 00:45:02,950
<b>she spent the entire day
washing the dishes in the kitchen.</b>

813
00:45:03,649 --> 00:45:06,519
<b>You have no idea
how frustrating it was.</b>

814
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:07,990
<b>Right.</b>

815
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:11,159
<b>Gosh, really?</b>

816
00:45:12,190 --> 00:45:14,330
<b>Also, let's be honest here.</b>

817
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,159
<b>You know she lacks in many ways.</b>

818
00:45:17,159 --> 00:45:18,559
<b>She didn't even graduate
from a decent school.</b>

819
00:45:19,269 --> 00:45:22,799
<b>I was going to
let all of that slide,</b>

820
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:26,070
<b>but she wouldn't swallow her pride.</b>

821
00:45:26,710 --> 00:45:31,179
<b>She could at least
try to learn a decent skill...</b>

822
00:45:31,639 --> 00:45:35,480
<b>or try to be more charming
as a woman.</b>

823
00:45:45,759 --> 00:45:47,590
<b>Are you going to the restroom?</b>

824
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:54,299
<b>No, I'm going home,</b>

825
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:56,899
<b>you punk.</b>

826
00:45:57,399 --> 00:45:59,539
<b>You little brat.</b>

827
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,009
<b>I can't believe what I'm hearing.</b>

828
00:46:02,379 --> 00:46:04,580
<b>What? She lacks in many ways?</b>

829
00:46:05,110 --> 00:46:06,549
<b>What does she lack?</b>

830
00:46:06,879 --> 00:46:09,620
<b>There aren't many women
who are as sweet as my Da Hee.</b>

831
00:46:09,879 --> 00:46:10,919
<b>Also,</b>

832
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:14,250
<b>how dare you take
my precious daughter home...</b>

833
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:16,159
<b>and make her wash dishes
before she's even married?</b>

834
00:46:16,159 --> 00:46:18,019
<b>I didn't make her. She...</b>

835
00:46:18,019 --> 00:46:19,289
<b>Shut it.</b>

836
00:46:22,629 --> 00:46:23,700
<b>Forget it.</b>

837
00:46:24,259 --> 00:46:25,470
<b>Now that I think about it,</b>

838
00:46:26,429 --> 00:46:28,169
<b>my Da Hee...</b>

839
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:30,700
<b>is too precious...</b>

840
00:46:31,669 --> 00:46:32,769
<b>to let you have her.</b>

841
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:36,440
<b>You can beg all you want.</b>

842
00:46:37,879 --> 00:46:39,080
<b>I won't give her to you.</b>

843
00:46:39,779 --> 00:46:40,950
<b>Never!</b>

844
00:46:45,590 --> 00:46:47,519
<b>You, uncross your legs.</b>

845
00:46:47,519 --> 00:46:50,090
<b>How dare you cross your legs
in front of your elders?</b>

846
00:46:51,590 --> 00:46:54,460
<b>Is it a civil service exam
you passed?</b>

847
00:46:54,789 --> 00:46:56,759
<b>So what if you did?</b>

848
00:46:57,659 --> 00:47:01,100
<b>You're a snobby brat
who doesn't respect people.</b>

849
00:47:04,299 --> 00:47:07,039
<b>Who does she think she is?</b>

850
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:10,980
<b>This is unbelievable.</b>

851
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:31,360
<b>Just leave it.</b>

852
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:32,960
<b>I'll do it once I'm done.</b>

853
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:35,929
<b>Forget it. Mom would
probably end up doing it...</b>

854
00:48:35,929 --> 00:48:38,000
<b>and she's already upset
because of me.</b>

855
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,700
<b>Gosh. Trying to be
Daughter of the Year now?</b>

856
00:48:40,769 --> 00:48:42,399
<b>That's rich considering
what you did.</b>

857
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:45,370
<b>What did I tell you?</b>

858
00:48:45,370 --> 00:48:47,340
<b>I said you'd get caught.</b>

859
00:48:47,769 --> 00:48:50,340
<b>Stay for all your classes.
Your mom is probably home.</b>

860
00:48:50,809 --> 00:48:53,850
<b>All right. Got it, Seo Young. Bye.</b>

861
00:48:53,850 --> 00:48:56,620
<b>You startled me.
I thought you were Mom.</b>

862
00:48:56,919 --> 00:48:58,149
<b>Are you all right, Da Hee?</b>

863
00:49:00,649 --> 00:49:02,990
<b>Mom seems to be less angry now.</b>

864
00:49:02,990 --> 00:49:04,720
<b>And so what if you're out here.</b>

865
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,789
<b>It's not like you did
something terribly wrong.</b>

866
00:49:06,789 --> 00:49:08,029
<b>It's all right.</b>

867
00:49:09,399 --> 00:49:10,600
<b>Mom, you're here.</b>

868
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:14,169
<b>Da Hee just got out of her room.
She says it just feels too stuffy.</b>

869
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:24,139
<b>Who told you to do the dishes?
Why are you doing this?</b>

870
00:49:24,139 --> 00:49:26,049
<b>Do you think we have
no one else to do the dishes?</b>

871
00:49:26,049 --> 00:49:27,080
<b>Mom.</b>

872
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:32,590
<b>From this time forth,</b>

873
00:49:35,019 --> 00:49:37,960
<b>never do the dishes, okay?</b>

874
00:49:47,299 --> 00:49:48,299
<b>What was that?</b>

875
00:49:48,899 --> 00:49:50,639
<b>Why did she take it out
on the dishes?</b>

876
00:49:51,039 --> 00:49:53,970
<b>I don't know.
She's different than usual.</b>

877
00:49:54,809 --> 00:49:56,940
<b>Hello, it's me.</b>

878
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:01,279
<b>Thank you for attending
the wedding ceremony.</b>

879
00:50:01,279 --> 00:50:02,879
<b>But can you tell me
your account number?</b>

880
00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:07,120
<b>No. I'd like to give
your gift money back.</b>

881
00:50:08,019 --> 00:50:11,389
<b>My daughter is getting an annulment.
It just happened.</b>

882
00:50:11,789 --> 00:50:14,960
<b>No, it's not a divorce.
Just an annulment.</b>

883
00:50:15,259 --> 00:50:17,429
<b>Sure. They didn't
register the marriage.</b>

884
00:50:17,429 --> 00:50:20,299
<b>They didn't even go on a honeymoon,
so it's not a divorce.</b>

885
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,629
<b>Right.</b>

886
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:25,200
<b>I said it's an annulment.
Why do you keep calling it divorce?</b>

887
00:50:25,769 --> 00:50:27,240
<b>Yes.</b>

888
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:30,740
<b>I'm sorry about yesterday.</b>

889
00:50:38,850 --> 00:50:41,289
<b>Do you want to eat out tonight?</b>

890
00:50:48,330 --> 00:50:50,600
<b>(Na Hee)</b>

891
00:50:51,059 --> 00:50:53,070
<b>I'll stop by at my parents'
after work.</b>

892
00:50:59,110 --> 00:51:00,139
<b>Yes.</b>

893
00:51:00,610 --> 00:51:03,379
<b>Can I get treatment now?</b>

894
00:51:03,379 --> 00:51:04,639
<b>I didn't make an appointment though.</b>

895
00:51:04,639 --> 00:51:07,909
<b>Hey, Jae Seok.
When did you come back?</b>

896
00:51:07,909 --> 00:51:08,980
<b>Gyu Jin!</b>

897
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:18,159
<b>You should've called home
as soon as you got back.</b>

898
00:51:18,159 --> 00:51:19,730
<b>You didn't even tell us
that you're back.</b>

899
00:51:20,259 --> 00:51:21,429
<b>And what's this about
staying at a hotel?</b>

900
00:51:22,159 --> 00:51:25,100
<b>This is why Mom is upset with you.
You know that?</b>

901
00:51:25,330 --> 00:51:27,799
<b>I do. That's why I didn't call her.</b>

902
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,940
<b>I went to Turkey to avoid Mom,
but she kept calling me.</b>

903
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:32,470
<b>What if she finds out that I'm back?</b>

904
00:51:33,169 --> 00:51:35,370
<b>You know I'm always
at odds with Mom.</b>

905
00:51:36,139 --> 00:51:39,149
<b>I need to be prepared
before I reunite with her.</b>

906
00:51:40,450 --> 00:51:42,879
<b>Don't be ridiculous.
Why did you come back then?</b>

907
00:51:42,879 --> 00:51:44,720
<b>You should've just settled down
and lived there.</b>

908
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:47,490
<b>I was going to,</b>

909
00:51:47,490 --> 00:51:48,919
<b>but I just couldn't live
in a foreign country for life.</b>

910
00:51:48,919 --> 00:51:51,820
<b>I can't eat pork there.</b>

911
00:51:52,789 --> 00:51:53,889
<b>The day I returned,</b>

912
00:51:53,889 --> 00:51:55,929
<b>I had pork belly
and soju with a friend.</b>

913
00:51:56,899 --> 00:51:58,860
<b>It felt like paradise.</b>

914
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:00,929
<b>You oddball.</b>

915
00:52:01,769 --> 00:52:03,000
<b>So what's your plan?</b>

916
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
<b>I should work.</b>

917
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,769
<b>I signed a contract today.
I'll start working right away.</b>

918
00:52:05,769 --> 00:52:07,570
<b>I guess you found a job
before you came back.</b>

919
00:52:07,570 --> 00:52:08,610
<b>Where is it?
Is it a university hospital?</b>

920
00:52:08,610 --> 00:52:10,080
<b>No, it's your hospital.</b>

921
00:52:14,450 --> 00:52:15,450
<b>Hey.</b>

922
00:52:16,019 --> 00:52:17,850
<b>How could you decide it
without telling me?</b>

923
00:52:19,549 --> 00:52:21,620
<b>Gyu Jin. It will be fun, right?</b>

924
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:24,159
<b>You, your wife, and I.
The three of us will work together.</b>

925
00:52:25,690 --> 00:52:26,789
<b>Well...</b>

926
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:29,360
<b>I'm a big fan of your wife.</b>

927
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:31,159
<b>She's smart and clumsy
at the same time.</b>

928
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,399
<b>She's so funny.</b>

929
00:52:34,330 --> 00:52:35,799
<b>She hasn't changed, has she?</b>

930
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:40,039
<b>I don't know. Did she not change?</b>

931
00:52:40,639 --> 00:52:41,870
<b>It feels like she did.</b>

932
00:52:43,610 --> 00:52:44,980
<b>Am I the one who has changed?</b>

933
00:52:45,710 --> 00:52:47,509
<b>Mom, I'm here.</b>

934
00:52:47,509 --> 00:52:49,250
<b>What's all this?</b>

935
00:52:49,779 --> 00:52:52,750
<b>I bet she's not
in the mood for cooking.</b>

936
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:54,250
<b>Is she in her room?</b>

937
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:55,450
<b>Hey. Don't go in there.</b>

938
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:58,690
<b>She passed out
after making 200 phone calls.</b>

939
00:52:58,990 --> 00:53:01,029
<b>"Hey, it's not a divorce.
It's an annulment."</b>

940
00:53:01,029 --> 00:53:02,599
<b>She said that thousands of times.</b>

941
00:53:02,599 --> 00:53:03,960
<b>It still rings in my ears.</b>

942
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:05,730
<b>"Divorce, annulment."</b>

943
00:53:07,170 --> 00:53:08,230
<b>What about Da Hee?</b>

944
00:53:13,869 --> 00:53:16,640
<b>Da Hee, what are you doing alone?
It's chilly out here.</b>

945
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:17,809
<b>You're drinking without snacks.</b>

946
00:53:17,809 --> 00:53:19,849
<b>Na Hee brought
your favorite trotters.</b>

947
00:53:19,910 --> 00:53:21,250
<b>Let's eat.</b>

948
00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:42,069
<b>What are you doing?</b>

949
00:53:42,099 --> 00:53:44,269
<b>Are you making rice
at this late hour?</b>

950
00:53:44,269 --> 00:53:47,970
<b>I'm making sikhye.
Da Hee likes sikhye.</b>

951
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:53,079
<b>Ga Hee told me.</b>

952
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:57,450
<b>Good. I'm glad
that you wrapped things up.</b>

953
00:53:59,650 --> 00:54:02,920
<b>We can't get our way
even with our own lives.</b>

954
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:04,789
<b>There's nothing we can do
about our children.</b>

955
00:54:05,619 --> 00:54:10,630
<b>Our children aren't any better
or worse than others.</b>

956
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:13,700
<b>It just happened
because we weren't lucky.</b>

957
00:54:14,369 --> 00:54:15,700
<b>We just have to get through it.</b>

958
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:19,769
<b>Okay?</b>

959
00:54:32,490 --> 00:54:35,650
<b>Da Hee,
don't beat yourself up too much.</b>

960
00:54:35,819 --> 00:54:37,619
<b>Mom will get over it soon.</b>

961
00:54:37,990 --> 00:54:39,730
<b>I guess it will be a week at most.</b>

962
00:54:39,990 --> 00:54:42,559
<b>I agree. She's used to things
like this because of us.</b>

963
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:43,900
<b>I'm sure this is
no big deal for her.</b>

964
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:46,069
<b>It's not that you divorced after
losing your house like Joon Seon.</b>

965
00:54:46,069 --> 00:54:48,069
<b>And you didn't come back home
with a child like I did.</b>

966
00:54:48,069 --> 00:54:51,500
<b>She's right. An annulment?
You're no match for us.</b>

967
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:53,069
<b>It's no big deal.</b>

968
00:54:53,069 --> 00:54:54,140
<b>I know.</b>

969
00:54:55,039 --> 00:54:57,380
<b>Are you guys trying to console her?</b>

970
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:00,109
<b>Joon Seon, Ga Hee, and Na Hee.</b>

971
00:55:00,109 --> 00:55:01,650
<b>- Yes?
- Yes. Go ahead.</b>

972
00:55:03,519 --> 00:55:07,650
<b>Actually, Young Hoon has
been seeing someone else.</b>

973
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:09,859
<b>A girl from the training institute.</b>

974
00:55:10,119 --> 00:55:11,220
<b>- What?
- What?</b>

975
00:55:12,690 --> 00:55:14,259
<b>Just sit down.</b>

976
00:55:18,130 --> 00:55:22,069
<b>Are you saying Cha Young Hoon
has been two-timing you?</b>

977
00:55:22,269 --> 00:55:23,269
<b>Yes.</b>

978
00:55:23,269 --> 00:55:24,599
<b>- That jerk...
- That jerk...</b>

979
00:55:26,269 --> 00:55:29,009
<b>He said he broke up with her,
but I don't think so.</b>

980
00:55:29,809 --> 00:55:31,910
<b>The girl did seem smart though.</b>

981
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:36,150
<b>To be honest,
I couldn't understand a word...</b>

982
00:55:36,150 --> 00:55:38,049
<b>his colleagues were saying.</b>

983
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:39,750
<b>It made me feel sad.</b>

984
00:55:41,849 --> 00:55:44,190
<b>But what's worse is...</b>

985
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:48,230
<b>that Young Hoon didn't
marry me for love.</b>

986
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:53,400
<b>His mom said he should marry
a slightly dimwitted woman.</b>

987
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:54,799
<b>That's why.</b>

988
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:57,099
<b>- Because I'm too nice.
- What?</b>

989
00:55:57,099 --> 00:55:59,140
<b>That crazy idiot.
I'm going to kill him.</b>

990
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:01,009
<b>Stop it.</b>

991
00:56:01,539 --> 00:56:04,039
<b>How could I stay calm?</b>

992
00:56:04,609 --> 00:56:06,750
<b>Above all things,
I just can't forgive...</b>

993
00:56:06,750 --> 00:56:08,779
<b>a guy who cheats on his woman.</b>

994
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:11,920
<b>I will make him
lose his social standing.</b>

995
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:13,750
<b>Of course.
We should never let this slide.</b>

996
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:15,990
<b>The three of us should take
revenge on him.</b>

997
00:56:15,990 --> 00:56:17,920
<b>We should go
tear his two-timing legs apart.</b>

998
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:19,359
<b>How could you say such a thing?</b>

999
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:21,230
<b>She's right. That's disgusting.</b>

1000
00:56:21,490 --> 00:56:23,400
<b>How would you tear his legs apart?
That sounds terrible.</b>

1001
00:56:23,559 --> 00:56:25,700
<b>No, even that isn't
good enough for me.</b>

1002
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:27,430
<b>How could he look down on you...</b>

1003
00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:29,029
<b>just because he is well educated?</b>

1004
00:56:29,029 --> 00:56:32,339
<b>It's okay.
I think I'm better off this way.</b>

1005
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:36,109
<b>To be honest, I wasn't sure
Young Hoon was the right guy.</b>

1006
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:38,480
<b>I just married him for
his background like a snob.</b>

1007
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:42,650
<b>I think I'm getting another chance.</b>

1008
00:56:42,750 --> 00:56:45,579
<b>You're right.
This is better for you.</b>

1009
00:56:45,579 --> 00:56:47,490
<b>Sure. You could do better.</b>

1010
00:56:47,490 --> 00:56:48,619
<b>Of course.</b>

1011
00:56:48,990 --> 00:56:51,319
<b>But there is one thing I do regret.</b>

1012
00:56:51,859 --> 00:56:55,829
<b>I should've slapped him
in the face when we broke up.</b>

1013
00:56:56,529 --> 00:56:58,099
<b>Other than that, everything's fine.</b>

1014
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,269
<b>I will just focus on my work now.</b>

1015
00:57:02,269 --> 00:57:05,240
<b>I'll become a full-time employee
for sure.</b>

1016
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:07,740
<b>Good. You will. Good for you.</b>

1017
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:10,710
<b>Hey, we're always on your side.
Am I right?</b>

1018
00:57:10,839 --> 00:57:11,940
<b>Sure.</b>

1019
00:57:12,710 --> 00:57:13,710
<b>Are you?</b>

1020
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:16,450
<b>Forget it. It sounds so lame.</b>

1021
00:57:17,619 --> 00:57:19,720
<b>You always spoil the mood like that.</b>

1022
00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:22,019
<b>You're condescending as always.</b>

1023
00:57:22,019 --> 00:57:25,890
<b>My point. Na Hee is smart,
but she's quite condescending.</b>

<b>I know.</b>

1025
00:57:27,059 --> 00:57:28,630
<b>My gosh.</b>

1026
00:57:29,259 --> 00:57:31,160
<b>- Gosh.
- What are you?</b>

1027
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:33,029
<b>- Hey.
- Why...</b>

<b>Da Hee.</b>

1029

<b>Come here. Eat this.</b>

1030
00:57:41,970 --> 00:57:43,940
<b>Let's drink together.</b>

1031
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:45,609
<b>Okay.</b>

1032
00:57:45,609 --> 00:57:47,950
<b>- Cheers.
- Cheers.</b>

1033
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:52,119
<b>Did you spill it?</b>

1034

<b>The door is open.</b>

1035

<b>I'm here to settle things.</b>

1036
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:06,029
<b>Don't live like that.</b>

1037
00:58:06,029 --> 00:58:09,170
<b>And you should never get married
and just die alone.</b>

<b>How dare you do that to my sister?</b>

1039

<b>I'll tear your legs apart.</b>

1040

<b>Well...</b>

1041
00:58:16,809 --> 00:58:18,579
<b>What was that?</b>

1042
00:58:26,690 --> 00:58:30,890
<b>I heard you two-timed

<b>Is that a yes or a no?</b>

1045
00:58:42,869 --> 00:58:44,900
<b>So you punched me back.</b>

1046
00:58:45,269 --> 00:58:47,369
<b>I should've taken off the ring.
It hurts so bad.</b>

<b>- Do you get it?
- Yes.</b>

1049

<b>- Behave yourself.
- Okay.</b>
