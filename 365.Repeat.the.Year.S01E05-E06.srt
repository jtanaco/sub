5

<b>You should hurry home.</b>

6
00:00:21,011 --> 00:00:23,140
<b>I left a gift for you.</b>

7
00:00:24,011 --> 00:00:25,950
<b>A close colleague of mine died.</b>

8
00:00:26,011 --> 00:00:28,121
<b>I chose to reset to save him.</b>

<b>But if I could bring you back,
I'd do anything.</b>

<b>How did you know? How did you...</b>

11
00:00:37,861 --> 00:00:41,076
<b>All you need to know is

<b>- A hit-and-run accident.
- Thank you.</b>

16

<b>Gosh! I'm back! My friend died.</b>

17
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,221
<b>My friend got into the

<b>The same time, the same

19

<b>Did she get hurt because
I avoided the accident?</b>

20
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,160
<b>If it happened at the same time and place,</b>

21

<b>The person who ran over me...</b>

23

<b>Do you have proof?</b>

26
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:26,546
<b>That hypnosis session?</b>

27

<b>You invited both of us knowing the truth,

<b>Why did he pass away all of a sudden?</b>

34
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,731
<b>It was a heart attack.</b>

35
00:01:49,031 --> 00:01:51,246
<b>The deliveryman died not long ago.</b>

36
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,076
<b>Why did another guy die like this?</b>

37

<b>Did you find anything in

<b>There was someone she

<b>I thought she tripped and fell...</b>

<b>I'll bring her in.</b>

93

<b>Wait...</b>

94
00:05:59,281 --> 00:06:01,320
<b>- What was that?

<b>I was a victim of a hit-and-run accident.</b>

<b>And the driver...</b>

<b>was Seo Yeon Soo.</b>

102

<b>- What?
- No way.</b>

103
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,341

<b>Yes, it's me.</b>

108
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,937
<b>We met last night. We...</b>

109
00:06:46,961 --> 00:06:49,760
<b>Seo Yeon Soo is dead.</b>

110
00:06:50,901 --> 00:06:52,930
<b>- Dead?
- She's dead?</b>

111
00:06:56,570 --> 00:07:00,370
<b>I need to interrogate

117
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,981
<b>Why would you ask me?</b>

118
00:07:40,781 --> 00:07:43,051
<b>Then who else could I ask?</b>

119
00:07:44,591 --> 00:07:46,021
<b>We found her body...</b>

120

<b>at the Circular Park.</b>

121
00:07:51,161 --> 00:07:52,866
<b>I told you to be patient.</b>

122

<b>Only I know this,

00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,651
<b>This reset is quite dynamic.</b>

130
00:08:13,711 --> 00:08:14,697
<b>I'm being suspected of murder...</b>

131

<b>while trying to find

132

<b>You haven't answered me.</b>

133

<b>Was it you?</b>

134
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,130
<b>No.</b>

135
00:08:31,301 --> 00:08:33,046
<b>I'd only be able to catch Dae
Sung through Yeon Soo's testimony,</b>

136
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:34,801
<b>so why would I kill her?</b>

137
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:40,416
<b>All right. If you just tell the truth,</b>

138
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,916
<b>the interrogation won't take that long.</b>

<b>If you can, don't plead the Fifth.</b>

<b>The detective in

<b>You don't think Ga Hyeon really killed her,

<b>If I met the culprit who did that to me,</b>

144

<b>I would've killed them as well.</b>

<b>There's no way she would've done that.</b>

146
00:09:08,741 --> 00:09:10,200
<b>She's just a testifier.</b>

147

<b>She'll be out of there

<b>I really don't know what's going on.</b>

149

<b>They were all alive

<b>Why would I kill her? We
were going to marry next month.</b>

307
00:19:57,281 --> 00:20:00,021
<b>I believe Ms. Seo Yeon
Soo wanted to call it off.</b>

308
00:20:02,461 --> 00:20:05,531
<b>Where were you between
11:00pm to 1:00am last night?</b>

309
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,630
<b>You met Ms. Seo Yeon Soo, didn't you?</b>

310
00:20:10,761 --> 00:20:11,806
<b>No, I didn't.</b>

311
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:14,177
<b>You talked to her on the
phone at 11:00pm last night.</b>

312
00:20:14,201 --> 00:20:16,447
<b>The base station that
captured your phone signal...</b>

313
00:20:16,471 --> 00:20:19,116
<b>had been near that park
where Ms. Seo Yeon Soo died.</b>

314
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,917
<b>I was near that park, then I called her...</b>

315
00:20:20,941 --> 00:20:23,286
<b>to tell her that I can't come
because something came up.</b>

316
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:25,951
<b>Something came up? Like what?</b>

317
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:27,880
<b>Going to Naeilro Junkyard?</b>

318
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:29,350
<b>Go Dong Cheol.</b>

319
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,281
<b>You met him, didn't you?</b>

320
00:20:38,231 --> 00:20:40,967
<b>Yes, I did.</b>

321
00:20:40,991 --> 00:20:42,806
<b>He threatened me and said...</b>

322
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:45,550
<b>he'll hand over the security footage
unless I pay him, so I met him.</b>

323
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:48,100
<b>Yeon Soo wouldn't have
died if it wasn't for him.</b>

324
00:20:49,241 --> 00:20:51,640
<b>Do you admit that you're the culprit of...</b>

325
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:53,630
<b>the hit-and-run accident at Sodam Park?</b>

326
00:21:00,481 --> 00:21:01,751
<b>Mr. Kim Dae Sung.</b>

327
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:06,021
<b>Mr. Kim Dae Sung.</b>

328
00:21:06,691 --> 00:21:08,066
<b>As of this hour,</b>

329
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:11,036
<b>you became the suspect of the
hit-and-run accident at Sodam...</b>

330
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,536
<b>instead of the testifier...</b>

331
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,566
<b>of Ms. Seo Yeon Soo's death.</b>

332
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:17,707
<b>This is a very important case
where Ms. Min Ju Young died,</b>

333
00:21:17,731 --> 00:21:20,806
<b>and we have enough evidence
and proof that you did this.</b>

334
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:22,247
<b>If I do not arrest you now,</b>

335
00:21:22,271 --> 00:21:24,741
<b>you may try to tamper
the evidence or run away.</b>

336
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:28,241
<b>I told you.</b>

337
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:31,580
<b>You should've turned
yourself in to live in peace...</b>

338
00:21:31,751 --> 00:21:33,380
<b>instead of putting up a useless fight.</b>

339
00:21:35,481 --> 00:21:37,626
<b>You're under emergency arrest for...</b>

340
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:39,866
<b>professional negligence resulting
in injury as well as violating...</b>

341
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:40,927
<b>Additional Punishment
Law on Specific Crimes.</b>

342
00:21:40,951 --> 00:21:43,366
<b>You may consult an attorney
or choose to remain silent.</b>

343
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:45,890
<b>You may refuse to say anything
that can be used against you.</b>

344
00:21:48,531 --> 00:21:50,660
<b>But let's not put up a useless fight.</b>

345
00:21:53,801 --> 00:21:56,076
<b>If you're going to be like this,
just come back to our team.</b>

346
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,846
<b>Okay, fine. Just go. Hurry up and go.</b>

347
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:00,541
<b>Hey, wait.</b>

348
00:22:01,271 --> 00:22:02,511
<b>Did he make a confession?</b>

349
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,927
<b>Yes, but it's not Ms. Seo Yeon Soo's case.</b>

350
00:22:04,951 --> 00:22:06,711
<b>- It's for the hit-and-run accident.
- What?</b>

351
00:22:06,751 --> 00:22:08,251
<b>A hit-and-run case?</b>

352
00:22:08,951 --> 00:22:10,427
<b>Why did you bring in the
Traffic Department into this?</b>

353
00:22:10,451 --> 00:22:11,866
<b>That case is the same as this one.</b>

354
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:14,997
<b>Ms. Shin also had been saying
Kim caused the hit-and-run accident.</b>

355
00:22:15,021 --> 00:22:18,130
<b>Then have you been investigating
Ms. Shin Ga Hyeon's friend's case?</b>

356
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:20,691
<b>- Well, I...
- Ji Hyeong Ju!</b>

357
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:23,020
<b>This wasn't your first time
meeting Ms. Shin Ga Hyeon.</b>

358
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,360
<b>What is she saying?</b>

359
00:22:25,201 --> 00:22:27,046
<b>I went to look around Seo Yeon Soo's place,</b>

360
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:29,677
<b>and I heard Ms. Shin came
by often and made a scene.</b>

361
00:22:29,701 --> 00:22:31,717
<b>And the patrol division had
to come one of those times,</b>

362
00:22:31,741 --> 00:22:34,386
<b>and I heard you're the one who took her.</b>

363
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:37,017
<b>Why are you telling
them every single detail...</b>

364
00:22:37,041 --> 00:22:38,427
<b>of the account?</b>

365
00:22:38,451 --> 00:22:39,751
<b>What's going on?</b>

366
00:22:56,431 --> 00:22:58,400
<b>That woman came to me...</b>

367
00:22:59,271 --> 00:23:00,971
<b>and brought us together.</b>

368
00:23:01,741 --> 00:23:02,771
<b>Got it?</b>

369
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:06,670
<b>Stop.</b>

370
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:09,011
<b>Stop right there, Seo Yeon Soo!</b>

371
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,761
<b>What's your relationship
with Shin Ga Hyeon?</b>

372
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,267
<b>Why didn't you tell me that you knew her?</b>

373
00:23:25,291 --> 00:23:28,201
<b>You took a day off to investigate
her case and catch the culprit.</b>

374
00:23:28,231 --> 00:23:29,801
<b>Are you her personal assistant?</b>

375
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:32,277
<b>How can I just stand
around when I could see...</b>

376
00:23:32,301 --> 00:23:33,977
<b>the bad guy right there?</b>

377
00:23:34,001 --> 00:23:35,670
<b>There's a detective who's in charge!</b>

378
00:23:35,771 --> 00:23:37,747
<b>Why did you step in and to
make a huge deal out of this?</b>

379
00:23:37,771 --> 00:23:40,316
<b>- They didn't even have a suspect.
- Exactly.</b>

380
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:42,987
<b>Even the detective in
charge couldn't find a suspect.</b>

381
00:23:43,011 --> 00:23:45,451
<b>How did Ms. Shin Ga Hyeon find out?</b>

382
00:23:45,481 --> 00:23:49,150
<b>Why did she think Kim did it,
and why did you trust her?</b>

383
00:23:49,281 --> 00:23:50,580
<b>Well, because...</b>

384
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:54,066
<b>Anyway,
isn't it great that we caught the culprit?</b>

385
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:55,967
<b>If he was going to side with her,</b>

386
00:23:55,991 --> 00:23:57,991
<b>I'm sure he would've
ignored the security footage.</b>

387
00:23:58,231 --> 00:23:59,231
<b>Thanks.</b>

388
00:24:00,031 --> 00:24:02,600
<b>Ji Hyeong Ju. You're taking
your hands off this case.</b>

389
00:24:02,761 --> 00:24:04,001
<b>- Come out.
- Captain Heo.</b>

390
00:24:04,231 --> 00:24:05,600
<b>- What?
- I...</b>

391
00:24:06,301 --> 00:24:08,870
<b>Captain Heo, I'll let Ji Hyeong Ju go home.</b>

392
00:24:09,241 --> 00:24:10,947
<b>Hey, go home.</b>

393
00:24:10,971 --> 00:24:12,070
<b>Bye!</b>

394
00:24:16,681 --> 00:24:17,741
<b>Captain Heo.</b>

395
00:24:18,011 --> 00:24:19,981
<b>There's a report on Ms.
Seo Yeon Soo's case.</b>

396
00:24:29,291 --> 00:24:31,060
<b>Play it.</b>

397
00:24:32,691 --> 00:24:35,431
<b>I fell asleep on my way
down from the mountain.</b>

398
00:24:36,701 --> 00:24:38,100
<b>Stop right there, Seo Yeon Soo!</b>

399
00:24:38,431 --> 00:24:40,507
<b>Then I heard two women in a fight.</b>

400
00:24:40,531 --> 00:24:42,571
<b>Let's go to the police
station. You can talk there.</b>

401
00:24:47,011 --> 00:24:48,110
<b>Seo Yeon Soo.</b>

402
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:52,556
<b>I didn't want to cause a misunderstanding,</b>

403
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,660
<b>so I waited there for a
while before I climbed down.</b>

404
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,791
<b>I went back down after about 10 minutes,</b>

405
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,560
<b>but the woman in black clothes
was still sitting on the bench.</b>

406
00:25:03,221 --> 00:25:06,390
<b>It would've been weird to pass her by,
so I waited a while,</b>

407
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:09,400
<b>and left the park after she did.</b>

408
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:21,286
<b>Her statement matches the report.</b>

409
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:23,417
<b>If he left after Shin Ga Hyeon did,</b>

410
00:25:23,441 --> 00:25:25,511
<b>he could be the culprit too.</b>

411
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:28,170
<b>He wouldn't make
this report if he did this.</b>

412
00:25:31,521 --> 00:25:33,467
<b>Does this mean Ms. Shin
Ga Hyeon has an alibi?</b>

413
00:25:33,491 --> 00:25:35,560
<b>She was just seen on the bench.</b>

414
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:37,791
<b>We don't know how long she was there.</b>

415
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:41,390
<b>Hey! What are you doing over there?</b>

416
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,320
<b>Detective Ji,
the webtoon artist is here, right?</b>

417
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,070
<b>- Did she really kill her?
- She's here as a testifier.</b>

418
00:25:49,241 --> 00:25:51,177
<b>Why would you question
a testifier for hours?</b>

419
00:25:51,201 --> 00:25:52,987
<b>People on the internet and
social media are going crazy...</b>

420
00:25:53,011 --> 00:25:54,717
<b>saying the artist of "Hidden
Killer" became an actual killer.</b>

421
00:25:54,741 --> 00:25:56,981
<b>You're Reporter Hwang,
aren't you? The initial reporter.</b>

422
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,886
<b>You upload rumors on social
media and turn that into an article.</b>

423
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:01,310
<b>That's your specialty.</b>

424
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:03,890
<b>The way you misspelled a
few words was exactly the same.</b>

425
00:26:04,051 --> 00:26:06,350
<b>This case hasn't been closed yet.</b>

426
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:08,027
<b>Are you just concerned
about blowing up the case?</b>

427
00:26:08,051 --> 00:26:09,967
<b>It's not like I used her real name...</b>

428
00:26:09,991 --> 00:26:11,806
<b>or made up a case.</b>

429
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:13,407
<b>If she's found innocent,</b>

430
00:26:13,431 --> 00:26:16,400
<b>- it'll be reported...
- What if I beat you up now...</b>

431
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:20,630
<b>and apologize? Does
that make everything okay?</b>

432
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:24,376
<b>- What?
- Try to act like an intellect.</b>

433
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,471
<b>All right?</b>

434
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:30,157
<b>- Hey!
- We saw something suspicious.</b>

435
00:26:30,181 --> 00:26:32,110
<b>- We're here to make a report.
- What is it?</b>

436
00:26:32,711 --> 00:26:36,021
<b>We saw the artist of "Hidden
Killer" sitting on a bench at the park.</b>

437
00:26:36,551 --> 00:26:39,251
<b>Hey, what if someone is here?</b>

438
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:42,390
<b>Why would anyone be here at this hour?</b>

439
00:26:42,691 --> 00:26:43,920
<b>What's that?</b>

440
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:45,830
<b>Who's that woman?</b>

441
00:26:46,461 --> 00:26:50,360
<b>Hey, wait. Isn't she Maru?</b>

442
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,701
<b>- You know, of "Hidden Killer".
- Really?</b>

443
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,370
<b>Wow, that's amazing.</b>

444
00:26:54,501 --> 00:26:56,070
<b>- Let's take her picture.
- Okay.</b>

445
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,511
<b>Okay.</b>

446
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:03,181
<b>A selfie too.</b>

447
00:27:06,451 --> 00:27:09,027
<b>- We caught Maru.
- Her bare face is pretty too.</b>

448
00:27:09,051 --> 00:27:11,056
<b>- I'm glad we cut our academy.
- I thought she was a ghost.</b>

449
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,197
<b>- So scary.
- Is she here to feel scared?</b>

450
00:27:12,221 --> 00:27:14,027
<b>No wonder she's the
artist of "Hidden Killer".</b>

451
00:27:14,051 --> 00:27:15,761
<b>It's right here on this day, right?</b>

452
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,497
<b>We uploaded it as soon
as we took her picture.</b>

<b>Let's not worry in advance.</b>

<b>Do you want some more tea?</b>

<b>Hey.</b>

614

<b>at Sodam Park even before

<b>Why would I tell you something

<b>Are you really a clairvoyant?

<b>What?</b>

<b>Yes, he's the worker from the junkyard.</b>

632

<b>Did Seo Yeon Soo know him as well?</b>

<b>Don't trust that woman, Lee Shin, too much.</b>

<b>Hello, I'll be helping you from today on.</b>

641
00:39:20,114 --> 00:39:21,224
<b>My name is Koo Seung Min.</b>

642
00:39:22,024 --> 00:39:23,429
<b>Right, I heard.</b>

643
00:39:23,453 --> 00:39:25,254
<b>I wasn't in charge of webtoons,</b>

644
00:39:25,423 --> 00:39:27,193
<b>but I volunteered as your fan.</b>

645
00:39:27,224 --> 00:39:28,994
<b>It's truly an honor.</b>

646
00:39:29,793 --> 00:39:31,409
<b>I hope we get along.</b>

647
00:39:31,433 --> 00:39:34,980
<b>I prepared these for you myself.</b>

648
00:39:35,004 --> 00:39:37,240
<b>And these...</b>

649
00:39:37,264 --> 00:39:39,474
<b>are from your fans.
They're cheering you on.</b>

650
00:39:39,673 --> 00:39:42,819
<b>And I was specifically ordered
to buy these macarons...</b>

651
00:39:42,843 --> 00:39:44,019
<b>by our team manager.</b>

652
00:39:44,043 --> 00:39:45,614
<b>I heard you liked their macarons.</b>

653
00:39:46,514 --> 00:39:49,090
<b>I was told to help you focus...</b>

654
00:39:49,114 --> 00:39:51,484
<b>- on writing...
- I'm sorry.</b>

655
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:54,754
<b>- But I need to head out.
- Are you going somewhere?</b>

656
00:39:54,784 --> 00:39:56,230
<b>I'll drive you.</b>

657
00:39:56,254 --> 00:39:58,423
<b>That's okay.</b>

658
00:39:58,654 --> 00:40:01,200
<b>You can put all of
them in front of my door.</b>

659
00:40:01,224 --> 00:40:02,994
<b>I'll call you later.</b>

660
00:40:03,494 --> 00:40:05,210
<b>These macarons are organic,

661
00:40:05,234 --> 00:40:06,563
<b>Goodbye!</b>

662
00:40:07,234 --> 00:40:08,463
<b>I couldn't say bye properly.</b>

663
00:40:42,963 --> 00:40:44,803
<b>This is where Seo Yeon Soo died.</b>

664

<b>You're not even alarmed.</b>

665

<b>Mr. Hwang visited me.</b>

<b>(Lee Shin)</b>

667
00:41:06,953 --> 00:41:08,463
<b>He said people were anxious...</b>

668
00:41:08,793 --> 00:41:10,799
<b>due to Ms. Seo's death.</b>

669
00:41:10,823 --> 00:41:12,333
<b>What about you?</b>

670
00:41:13,093 --> 00:41:16,234
<b>You had already met her before the reset.</b>

671
00:41:16,364 --> 00:41:17,734
<b>How do you feel?</b>

672
00:41:21,274 --> 00:41:23,274
<b>To me, Ms. Seo Yeon Soo...</b>

673
00:41:23,874 --> 00:41:25,943
<b>was a bit special.</b>

674
00:41:26,573 --> 00:41:28,889
<b>Seo Yeong. Ms. Lee Seo Yeong.</b>

675
00:41:28,913 --> 00:41:31,090
<b>- My client left after a session.
- Are you listening to me?</b>

676
00:41:31,114 --> 00:41:33,354
<b>And she called me and
alluded to ending her life.</b>

677
00:41:34,654 --> 00:41:36,323
<b>I went to her as fast as I could.</b>

678
00:41:37,423 --> 00:41:40,093
<b>Seo Yeong! Seo Yeong!</b>

679
00:41:42,293 --> 00:41:43,764
<b>It wasn't my client.</b>

680
00:41:44,994 --> 00:41:46,439
<b>- It was Ms. Seo Yeon Soo.
- No.</b>

681
00:41:46,463 --> 00:41:47,610
<b>Hold my hand now!</b>

682
00:41:47,634 --> 00:41:48,864
<b>No!</b>

683
00:41:51,134 --> 00:41:52,333
<b>Are you all right?</b>

684
00:41:52,374 --> 00:41:53,504
<b>Let me see.</b>

685
00:41:58,514 --> 00:42:02,244
<b>That's how we met, and I suggested a reset.</b>

686
00:42:06,284 --> 00:42:08,224
<b>I promised her that...</b>

687
00:42:08,754 --> 00:42:10,183
<b>she could turn back everything.</b>

688
00:42:17,734 --> 00:42:19,894
<b>She was special to you,</b>

689
00:42:20,093 --> 00:42:23,404
<b>but why did she tell me
that I shouldn't trust you?</b>

690
00:42:23,604 --> 00:42:25,774
<b>As I promised, we came back in time,</b>

691
00:42:26,173 --> 00:42:28,374
<b>but everything was the same.</b>

692
00:42:30,303 --> 00:42:33,274
<b>And she had the same
misunderstanding as you.</b>

693
00:42:35,614 --> 00:42:38,484
<b>That I had already known about
the connection between you two.</b>

694
00:42:41,224 --> 00:42:42,754
<b>I can see how you'd think so.</b>

695
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:45,654
<b>Even I can't believe it.</b>

696
00:42:47,093 --> 00:42:49,624
<b>I thought about for days
how it must have felt...</b>

697
00:42:50,193 --> 00:42:51,864
<b>for the both of you.</b>

698
00:42:52,963 --> 00:42:54,864
<b>And I finally found an answer.</b>

699
00:42:57,534 --> 00:42:59,333
<b>It was fate.</b>

700
00:43:01,274 --> 00:43:03,573
<b>You were fated to meet in this way.</b>

701
00:43:06,443 --> 00:43:07,744
<b>Fate?</b>

702
00:43:09,713 --> 00:43:11,614
<b>If that's truly the answer,</b>

703
00:43:11,953 --> 00:43:13,354
<b>it's too easy.</b>

704
00:43:14,453 --> 00:43:16,024
<b>And it's cruel too.</b>

705
00:44:13,313 --> 00:44:14,374
<b>Maru.</b>

706
00:44:17,043 --> 00:44:18,159
<b>I'm sorry to come at this hour.</b>

707
00:44:18,183 --> 00:44:20,053
<b>No, it's okay. Come on in.</b>

708
00:44:23,984 --> 00:44:26,323
<b>Why are they together in this photo?</b>

709
00:44:26,624 --> 00:44:29,663
<b>The worker at the
junkyard was Bae Jung Tae.</b>

710
00:44:30,323 --> 00:44:31,394
<b>What?</b>

711
00:44:32,433 --> 00:44:35,480
<b>Then, Bae Jung Tae and Seo Yeon Soo...</b>

712
00:44:35,504 --> 00:44:38,573
<b>It's possible that they knew
each other before the reset.</b>

713
00:44:40,474 --> 00:44:41,774
<b>My gosh.</b>

714
00:44:42,404 --> 00:44:44,673
<b>Then, Ms. Lee was lying even to the end.</b>

715
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:46,990
<b>We met this afternoon.</b>

716
00:44:47,014 --> 00:44:48,990
<b>She told me it was a coincidence
Seo Yeon Soo and I met.</b>

717
00:44:49,014 --> 00:44:50,360
<b>She even talked about it being our fate.</b>

718
00:44:50,384 --> 00:44:53,683
<b>I just came back from a
meeting with Ms. Lee as well.</b>

719
00:44:53,713 --> 00:44:54,784
<b>What?</b>

720
00:45:07,293 --> 00:45:08,740
<b>You didn't call ahead.
What brings you here?</b>

721
00:45:08,764 --> 00:45:12,104
<b>Well, you were the one who
told us to feel free to come to you.</b>

722
00:45:12,504 --> 00:45:14,649
<b>That's right. Take a seat.</b>

723
00:45:14,673 --> 00:45:15,673
<b>Okay.</b>

724
00:45:16,774 --> 00:45:19,073
<b>You probably heard what happened to...</b>

725
00:45:20,073 --> 00:45:21,284
<b>Ms. Seo Yeon Soo, right?</b>

726
00:45:21,583 --> 00:45:24,884
<b>Yes. I am very sad about what happened.</b>

727
00:45:26,754 --> 00:45:29,224
<b>Everyone underwent the
reset to live a better life.</b>

728
00:45:29,683 --> 00:45:31,923
<b>I don't know why this keeps happening.</b>

729
00:45:32,453 --> 00:45:34,154
<b>Just like someone's claim,</b>

730
00:45:35,624 --> 00:45:38,933
<b>you don't believe there's
a rule about death, do you?</b>

731
00:45:43,234 --> 00:45:46,034
<b>I came here to ask you for a favor.</b>

732
00:45:47,073 --> 00:45:49,803
<b>Are you in touch with Mr. Bae Jung Tae?</b>

733
00:45:51,244 --> 00:45:53,843
<b>I've been calling him,</b>

734
00:45:53,943 --> 00:45:55,744
<b>but I can't reach him at all.</b>

735
00:45:55,884 --> 00:45:57,090
<b>Why do you want to reach him?</b>

736
00:45:57,114 --> 00:45:59,490
<b>It has to do with an investigation.
I can't tell you the details.</b>

737
00:45:59,514 --> 00:46:01,683
<b>I take it that it's not good news, then.</b>

738
00:46:02,724 --> 00:46:04,124
<b>I understand.</b>

739
00:46:04,384 --> 00:46:06,024
<b>I would like to ask you...</b>

740
00:46:07,154 --> 00:46:09,124
<b>for a favor, Detective Ji.</b>

741
00:46:09,193 --> 00:46:11,000
<b>She knew that I was a detective.</b>

742
00:46:11,024 --> 00:46:13,894
<b>And she knew about the weird
rule Ko Jae Young talked about.</b>

743
00:46:14,394 --> 00:46:15,779
<b>Seo Yeon Soo must have told her.</b>

744
00:46:15,803 --> 00:46:17,240
<b>They knew each other before the reset.</b>

745
00:46:17,264 --> 00:46:18,703
<b>She must've reported...</b>

746
00:46:19,034 --> 00:46:21,419
<b>Seo Yeon Soo wasn't at the funeral.</b>

747
00:46:21,443 --> 00:46:23,274
<b>She wouldn't know about the rule.</b>

748
00:46:25,813 --> 00:46:28,460
<b>The owner of the cafe told
me that he was at Zian Clinic.</b>

749
00:46:28,484 --> 00:46:30,744
<b>Did he tell her about the rule?</b>

750
00:46:31,484 --> 00:46:33,189
<b>I already called him.</b>

751
00:46:33,213 --> 00:46:35,730
<b>He talked about Seo Yeon Soo's death,</b>

752
00:46:35,754 --> 00:46:37,553
<b>but he didn't talk about anything else.</b>

753
00:46:38,923 --> 00:46:42,193
<b>I mean, then who on earth told her?</b>

754
00:46:42,264 --> 00:46:43,894
<b>Here's what's even more strange.</b>

755
00:46:45,593 --> 00:46:47,563
<b>I would like to ask you...</b>

756
00:46:47,764 --> 00:46:49,604
<b>for a favor, Detective Ji.</b>

757
00:46:51,504 --> 00:46:54,024
<b>I need information about the
people who went through the reset.</b>

758
00:46:54,534 --> 00:46:56,279
<b>I only offered them the chance,</b>

759
00:46:56,303 --> 00:46:58,744
<b>but I don't know much about the people...</b>

760
00:46:58,913 --> 00:47:00,644
<b>who went through the reset.</b>

761
00:47:01,073 --> 00:47:03,289
