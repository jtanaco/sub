1
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:04,580
Ma'am, stay awake.

2
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,410
Hang in there. We're almost there.

3
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:13,480
You need to stay awake, okay? Yes, stay awake.

4
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:16,250
Please stay focused. Okay, let's do this. Now, push!

5
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,720
That's great! Good!

6
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,860
You need to breathe. One more time. Push!

7
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:33,440
Give me a long one. Push!

8
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,690
Gosh, how adorable.

9
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:57,230
Look at you.

10
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:00,330
How are you so adorable? My goodness gracious.

11
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:06,540
Ha Ri, your baby is so cute. Do you want to see?

12
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:09,340
Come on. Let's go to your mommy, my dear.

13
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:10,610
There's your mommy.

14
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,140
Mommy. Mommy.

15
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,050
That's your mommy.

16
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:30,360
Mom!

17
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,010
"Hello, I'm 39 years old, and I'm single."

18
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:45,610
"I was single yesterday, and I'm single today."

19
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:47,210
"So I'll probably be single tomorrow as well."

20
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,450
"I haven't been able to meet a guy for a very long time."

21
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:52,720
"And now, love is like a miracle that might never occur to me."

22
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:56,020
"But I still have hope, so can you please show me..."

23
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:58,520
"a small miracle by sending me some snacks?"

24
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,860
Ms. Jang Ha Ri, I can totally relate.

25
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,830
But let me tell you that the small miracle...

26
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:08,170
you've desperately hoped for has come true.

27
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:10,940
You won the draw, so you will be given...

28
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,340
a box of snacks!

29
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,450
Your name is Jang Ha Ri. You're 39.

30
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:22,650
And you're single.

31
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,180
You've had sex before, right?

32
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,420
Yes.

33
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:29,390
It was in 2010 during the Vancouver Winter Olympics.

34
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:32,360
It was 10 years ago? So you didn't have sex recently?

35
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:34,490
I did go on blind dates but...

36
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:35,890
When did you finish your period?

37
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:38,260
A month ago.

38
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,860
It's time I have my next one.

39
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:42,700
Recently, I started having very bad period cramps.

40
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,200
Last month, I almost fainted due to the pain.

41
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:46,870
I even had to go to the ER once.

42
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,670
Then why didn't you get it checked?

43
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:54,450
Well, I was too busy working day and night.

44
00:03:56,550 --> 00:04:00,550
I don't have much time today either, so I just want some painkillers...

45
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:02,890
and go home after I take the AMH test.

46
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:04,590
That means I just need to take a blood test, right?

47
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,360
Your hormone levels will tell us the age of your ovaries...

48
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,530
and how many eggs you have left.

49
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,460
Do you plan to have babies?

50
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,730
When are you getting married?

51
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,830
I don't know when I'll get married.

52
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:18,040
I'm more urgent to get pregnant than to get married.

53
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:20,500
So I'd like to freeze my eggs.

54
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:22,810
I want to freeze...

55
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,180
a few of my healthiest eggs until I finally meet the one.

56
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,500
Excuse me.

57
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:49,170
Me?

58
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,600
Yes?

59
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:55,440
Is there a pharmacy nearby?

60
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,510
A pharmacy?

61
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:01,110
It's over there.

62
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:07,180
Hey! I'm going to call the cops.

63

There's a pervert here! Please help!

68
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:36,180
- Hey! - He's over there!

69
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,220
- Stop right there! - Is this the police?

70
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,980
- Let's go. - Take him.

Are you really going to freeze your eggs?

74
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:03,170
Why do you want kids? I get sick of them just by looking at them.

75
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:04,910
How is it possible to hate kids?

76
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,840
I fall in love just by looking at them.

77
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,380
It's hard to come across a woman like you.

Who has babies these days?

79
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:13,780
I wouldn't have married if my husband...

80
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,050
insisted on having a child.

81
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:18,360
How can you marry a man who doesn't want kids?

82
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,520
There they are.

83
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,560
Which one's better?

00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,630
- This one. - Okay.

85
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:31,470
Nice.

86
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:33,140
Why ask for my opinion then?

I see you're with a friend.

You've been loved for 13 years now since your debut in 2003.

00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,520
What's your secret?

94
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:37,730
Could you tell us why people find you so charming?

95
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:46,980
Is there a reason why your goggles always stay on?

96
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:06,360
I found him.

97
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:08,600

- I found him. - You did?

101
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:15,370
He's on Outstagram.

It's him, isn't it?

Yes, it is Han I Sang.

104

I see he's back in Korea.

105

What on earth has he been up to though?

and have her nap for two hours.

00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:14,910
Nice house.

167
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:24,220
Magazines and advertising agencies have been calling nonstop...

168
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:25,690
now that they know you're back.

169
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,960
Are you forcing me back to work...

170
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,290
when I'm not done taking a break?

171
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,560
Three years is more than enough.

172
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,600
Would you seriously turn down a photo shoot with an A-lister?

173
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,400
Yes, I would.

174
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:39,700
- Why? - Because you suggested it.

175
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:41,170
What are you, a moody teen?

176
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:45,580
Must you be like that when I'm here helping you move?

177
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:48,210
You're making me uncomfortable so put that down.

178
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:50,780
This is my way of kissing up to you.

179
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,280
Sign with my agency.

180
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:54,950
What do you say?

181
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,020
No thanks.

182
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,700
You have time for a marathon but not to call me?

183
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,610
You have time to fly but not sit down with me?

184
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:17,110
You have time to go to an amusement park...

185
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:18,310
but not contact me?

186
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:21,210
You have time to sew but not return any of my texts?

187
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:30,720
Auntie!

188
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,390
I can't believe I responded to that.

189
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:39,360
Did he seriously just call you Auntie?

190
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,460
Apparently, I'm the same age as his youngest aunt.

191
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,870
Unbelievable. Does he not know that this is a workplace?

192
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,640
Why haven't you said anything?

193
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,940
How can I?

194
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,170
I practically encouraged him myself.

195
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:10,830
I can't suddenly blame it on the fact that I was drunk.

196
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:13,140
If he's not too daft, he'll change his ways.

197
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,180
Are you back from your interview?

198
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,480
Well, I'm coming back from a meeting.

199
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,180
I can hold my own in one now.

200
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,250
I'm proud of you.

201
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,290
- What's wrong? - Menstrual cramps.

202
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:35,560
I've been running errands for my mom when she's on her period.

203
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:38,900
She taught me that menstruation is nothing to be ashamed of.

204
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:42,470
Is it severe?

205
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,240
I can't get you any water right now.

206
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,640
It's all right. Let me help.

207
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:49,140
This way.

208
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,480
Excuse me, but she has menstrual cramps.

209
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,610
Could you hold the elevator for us?

210
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:57,350
I'm sorry about this, but she has menstrual cramps. Be careful.

211
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,350
Please let her cut in line. She has menstrual cramps.

212
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,760
Careful.

213
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:06,230
Are you all right? Is it bad?

214
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:08,290
Can you hold your head up?

215
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,860
Are you sure you're all right?

216
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,830
What now?

217
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:14,600
The elevator is here.

218
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:17,540
Auntie, come on. We need to move.

219
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,710
Sorry about this.

220
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:19,840
Going up.

221
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,670
Just hang in there, all right?

222
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:23,910
- What the... - What did my mom say again?

223
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:26,810
She described the pain as excruciating.

224
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,450
Ms. Jang, hang in there.

225
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:31,820
What do you do for menstrual cramps?

226
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:38,760
- Auntie, we're here. - Move! Out of my way.

227
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:44,230
Unbelievable.

228
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:47,230
The pain must've been unbearable.

229
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,400
Who is she?

230
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,310
Oh, she's Deputy Manager Jang Ha Ri of "The Baby".

231
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:03,150
He can't take a hint at all, can he?

232
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,850
I'm afraid Ha Ri will be stuck being called Auntie.

233
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,800
(Use a wet towelllllllllll)

234
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,470
(Recruitment Qualifications)

235
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,410
Hyo Joo, come here for a second.

236
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,240
- Hyo Joo. - Yes?

237
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:35,420
What is this?

238
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:37,950
"Infertility can be treated with herbal tonics."

239
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:39,450
Is this what they wanted?

240
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:42,560
Dr. Ko said he's getting a patent for herbal tonic treatments,

241
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,660
and asked us to stress it.

242
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:46,290
Still, you can't write down whatever they say.

243
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:48,390
Let's not get sued.

244
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,860
We're already the ugly duckling in the company.

245
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,230
What choice do we have? It's Advertising's page.

246
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,770
I'm too nice to fight.

247
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:12,150
So Yoon.

248
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:25,330
Sir.

249
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:28,370
You scared me.

250
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:31,240
What? You're scaring me.

251
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:33,740
Must we write Dr. Ko's advertisement piece like this?

252
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,110
It's good.

253
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:43,150
"It has an excellent effect on treating infertility."

254
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,450
That's how they wanted it written.

255
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:47,420
There you go again. Just because your name won't be on it.

256
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:48,660
If people complain,

257
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,520
the reporter whose name is on it must take responsibility.

258
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:56,460
Seriously. Stop being so inflexible.

259
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,100
They wanted to stop advertising with us. I worked really hard...

260
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,330
to get this.

261
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,000
Work with me.

262
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:08,370
Some readers know these advertisement pieces are ads,

263
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:10,680
but some believe the articles and go to them.

264
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:12,980
And it's about infertility. Imagine how desperate they must be.

265
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:16,250
Will you be accountable if this is all a lie?

266
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:20,050
- Why should I be accountable? - Exactly, so I won't print it.

267
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,260
I really don't want to do this, but we'll lose the advertisement fee,

268
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:28,390
so I'll report this to the higher-ups.

269
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:29,400
Go ahead.

270
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,540
Come in.

271
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,840
Ms. Jang wants to take out the ad.

272
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,710
- What? - The ad on herbal tonics...

273
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,020
Ms. Jang.

274
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,990
Ms. Jang, get up. Get up.

275
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:04,060
Please get up.

276
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:13,770
Ms. Jang.

277
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:17,780
I know I adore you, but you can't do this.

278
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,480
That's why I'm doing this.

279
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,680
You impinge on my editing authority thoughtlessly,

280
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,790
so I'm going to lie here thoughtlessly as well.

281
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:35,400
Strictly put, you're not the editor-in-chief.

282
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:37,760
You're only the acting editor-in-chief.

283
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:40,500
That's why I'm lying here in Ms. Shim's place.

284
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,400
Do you miss her? Shall I call her in?

285
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,570
No, no, no, no.

286
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:48,010
Why would you call in someone who's resting after having a baby?

287
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:53,450
Ms. Jang.

288
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:56,280
This is why you can't get married.

289
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,020
Oh, my gosh. Again.

290
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:01,890
You need to watch what you say before I make you pay.

291
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:11,060
Fine. I get it, so get up. Let's talk.

292
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:14,330
I'll remove the article.

293
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:17,540
Fine, but since Editing took it out,

294
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:18,840
Editing must take responsibility.

295
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,970
Yes, sir. We will.

296
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:23,580
Since it affects our department's income.

297
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:25,310
Are you done?

298
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:26,550
Yes, sir.

299
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:34,350
Ms. Jang. Stay and chat with me.

300
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,520
Yes, sir.

301
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:43,000
Yes, sir.

302
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,150
I don't want to date you.

303
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:02,250
You punk. I'm married with kids.

304
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,520
It's been so long since I saw you. I'm happy, that's all.

305
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:08,350
I even prepared your favorite liquor.

306
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:17,330
You haven't been to our studio in a while, right? Want a tour?

307
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:20,230
- I looked around already. - Okay.

308
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:24,500
I assume your trip was nice.

309
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,810
You'll get back to work, right?

310
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:34,880
- What? - Just because.

311
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,720
I'm sure you'll get a lot of job offers...

312
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,950
although you took a long break.

313
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:43,520
So I figure you'll need a studio as soon as possible.

314
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:47,990
It'll be really hard to find a studio.

315
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:50,200
Rent shot up.

316
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,800
You need all new equipment too.

317
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:55,200
I'm just thinking of you.

318
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,540
Things are bad overall,

319
00:21:57,870 --> 00:21:59,610
so I thought...

320
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:03,440
it would be good to share the studio...

321
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,780
with me.

322
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,080
No.

323
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:16,520
Isn't Jang Ha Ri working at "The Baby"?

324
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:20,560
My gosh. You even remember her name.

325
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,770
So Yoon, what happened to the story about the kid who picks his nose?

326
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:30,440
I'm still picking at it.

327
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,100
Stop picking at it, and give it to me.

328
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,440
Hyo Joo, what are you working on?

329
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:36,940
- Breast pumps. - Stop squeezing it out. Finish it.

330
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:37,980
Yeon Ho?

331
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,880
I'm almost done with the constipation piece.

332
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:41,950
Sure. It's time to stop going.

333
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,120
Ha Ri, can we take a break?

334
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:47,890
I'm starving.

335
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,090
Should we have a snack?

336
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:55,900
- Yes. - Thank goodness.

337
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:59,700
Was there anything else?

338
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,830
Like jewelry or clothes?

339
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:04,800
You know I made my personal woes public...

340
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,410
just to feed you guys.

341
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:09,310
They must have really pitied you if they chose your story.

342
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:14,150
So Yoon, you have unparalleled skill in hurting people's feelings.

343
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:15,820
Don't be so sensitive.

344
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,950
Why don't you have a boyfriend?

345
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:23,560
You're attractive and successful.

346
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,830
Are you too picky?

347
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:29,330
Hey. What do you take her for?

348
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,600
She may not look it,

349
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,370
but she falls in love easily.

350
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,670
She falls for any old schmoe.

351
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,410
She's easy.

352
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:43,080
That's right. I'm super easy, but still, right?

353
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,540
That one was the best.

354
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:48,210
She fell for a guy in front of the studio in three seconds.

355
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:50,580
Just how hot was he?

356
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:51,750
Hey.

357
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,760
He wasn't hot.

358
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:01,660
He was crying.

359
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:06,390
I never saw a guy cry before.

360
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,760
They say a man's tears...

361
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,470
make the heart cry.

362
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:17,240
I thought she was a total psycho.

363
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:21,840
Psycho? She's not that bad.

364
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,310
You didn't see the look in her eyes.

365
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,980
And I don't want to.

366
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:30,020
I don't like aggressive girls.

367
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,150
So? Did you hit on him?

368
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:35,350
He was a psycho.

369
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:40,630
Forget men. I need to have kids.

370
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:43,660
What should I do? I'm turning 40 next year.

371
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:47,400
You can get married quickly and have a baby right away.

372
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:49,540
With whom? Where and how will she meet him?

373
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:51,600
Sign up for a matchmaking service.

374
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,140
I used to be a VVIP at Get Married because I was "marriage material".

375
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:57,380
Now, I get calls from second marriage services.

376
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:01,510
Girls. Stop saying useless things.

377
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:03,480
Find a good-looking rich guy.

378
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:06,590
Good-looking rich guys will never date old women.

379
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:07,620
Agreed.

380
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:10,560
- Not a chance. - Choi Hyo Joo.

381
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,720
Yes?

382
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,090
You don't know the half of it.

383
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:17,360
It's hard to even date a normal guy.

384
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:20,830
The only decent guy I can date at my age is either already married...

385
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:21,970
or dead.

386
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:27,370
Who gets married these days?

387
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:29,740
You should just stay single all your life.

388
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:33,880
What?

389
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:37,380
She... She's right. My friend doesn't date either.

390
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:42,150
She thinks it's pathetic to be obsessed with dating and marriage.

391
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,430
Then am I going against the current trend?

392
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:47,760
I guess you could say that.

393
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,400
It looks like Generation Z has a hard time understanding you.

394
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,960
- Right? - Yes.

395
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,460
I hate her the most.

396
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:54,500
The problem might be...

397
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:57,970
that you're too obsessed with marriage and having babies.

398
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,970
Gosh, I'm so tired.

399
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:03,510
I'm so exhausted.

400
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:12,480
Should I tell you guys a scary story?

401
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:18,890
I'm your future.

402
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,300
How is she my future?

403
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,800
Why would I end up like her?

404
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:31,300
You guys are in big trouble.

405
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:35,210
Let's see.

406
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,010
Is the new editor-in-chief single?

407
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:42,350
You say you understand women who just became mothers.

408
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:43,750
But I can easily tell you're not married.

409
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,760
What does a single woman know about childcare?

410
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,120
Is a single woman allowed to write articles about childcare?

411
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,760
A mother can't be a journalist.

412
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,990
The job requires too much overtime work,

413
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:56,100
and you can barely even go home.

414
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:02,470
What they say in magazines are all true.

415
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:04,770
But it's hard to do what they say when you actually become a mother.

416
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:08,510
Reading about childcare is different from actual childcare.

417
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:11,740
But you wouldn't know since you're not a mother.

418
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:18,220
Ms. Jang, why don't you move to "Unique" or "The House"?

419
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:21,990
You've been working at "The Baby" for way too long.

420
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:25,990
It'll be hard to get promoted once Ms. Shim returns.

421
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:29,360
And even if the position for editor-in-chief becomes vacant,

422
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,260
you won't be able to get the position.

423
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:32,900
You know...

424
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:35,970
single women can't become the editor-in-chief of "The Baby".

425
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,140
It's not like I'll never get married.

426
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:46,110
- What? - I want to have a baby.

427
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,210
Once I start dating, I'll get pregnant before the wedding.

428
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:51,620
And when is that going to be?

429
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:57,020
Don't stay at a place where there's a slim chance for you to grow.

430
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:00,930
Go to a place where you could become an editor-in-chief.

431
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:04,230
I'm telling you this for your own sake.

432
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:20,850
Ha Ri rarely even comes by.

433
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:23,480
She's a deputy manager, so you guys won't even meet.

434
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:25,080
My gosh.

435
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:27,350
Did you find a place to live?

436
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:31,920
I moved in today. It's near the park in Hangang-dong.

437
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:35,830
"Hangang-dong"? "The park"?

438
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,900
Why does it have to be Ha Ri's neighborhood?

439
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:51,140
- Hello. - Hey, welcome.

440
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:54,310
I'm glad you're here.

441
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:56,220
- Have you been well? - Yes, of course.

That's today's new menu.

445
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:05,320
The Pacific saury gratin. It doesn't taste that fishy.

446
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,730
- You should try it. - Sure.

447
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:14,930
I'll get you a new pair of chopsticks.

448
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:16,240
It sounds delicious.

449
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:29,450
- How did it taste? - It... It was delicious.

450
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:31,850
- Thank you for the food. - No problem.

Oh, gosh.

457

If you drink this, it means we're going out.

458

What if I don't drink it?

What are you doing here?

I moved here yesterday.

468
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:36,910
Move where?

469
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:39,050
- You moved into our house? - Yes.

470
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:42,120
Why? Why would you move into our house?

Hey, did my mom let you rent this place?

474
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:57,000
She was the one who offered to let me live here.

475

She never told me anything about his.

What's your problem?

Why would I lose the house? We got divorced because of her.

484
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:34,200
She even paid back the money she borrowed as alimony.

485
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,740
At least she had some conscience.

486

- That nasty brat. - Yes, she's a nasty brat.

But you have no conscience.

You show up in five years and have the guts to chat with me?

How could you look at me like nothing ever happened?

00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,500
My gosh.

493
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:03,830
To be honest,

494
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:07,870
I just can't seem to raise my daughter all by myself.

495
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:10,740
My parents want me to live with them in the States.

496
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:13,910
But how can I?

497
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:18,750
My friend, you're the only one I can trust and rely on.

498
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:20,820
After all this time?

499
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:23,090
Jeong Won hated my guts,

500
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:25,490
so you didn't think twice about cutting me from your life.

501
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,860
But now that she has left you,

502
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:31,030
you come back to me pretending like nothing happened?

503
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,170
My daughter Do Ah is in the other room.

504
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:40,940
Talk to me again once you've said hello.

505
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:45,440
Unbelievable.

506
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:57,790
You must be Do Ah.

507
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:01,490
Gosh, you're a sweetheart.

508
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:08,830
Do you not wash your own kid?

509
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:12,940
Babies are supposed to be messy like this.

510
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:14,840
This is practically normal.

511
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,840
Why is her bottle so small?

512
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:21,080
At eight months, she should be having at least 240ml.

513
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,150
How did you know...

514
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:24,910
that Do Ah's eight months old?

515
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:28,420
You drew a short straw when it comes to Dads.

516
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:29,990
Gosh, you poor thing.

517
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:32,990
I feel bad for you, Do Ah.

518
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:36,260
She's adorable, isn't she?

519
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:39,260
Yes, and that's why I'm giving you a day.

520
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,800
You have until tomorrow to leave.

521
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,330
Really? When she's this adorable?

522
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:45,030
When she's only eight months old?

523
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:47,040
When we have nowhere else to go?

524
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:51,370
All right. I have a deadline to meet, so I'll be back at 2am.

525
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:53,210
Leave the baby and move out.

526
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:55,440
Give her back or I'll call the police.

527
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,450
She was scary, wasn't she?

528
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,050
Nasty lady!

529
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,790
Please don't cry.

530
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,240
You're actually Jae Young's mom, aren't you?

531
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,510
It killed me...

532
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:30,910
to see him go from dandy to scruffy.

533
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:33,350
We'll make room for him at mealtime...

534
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,580
and see if he's feeding his daughter properly.

535
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:38,520
He's also been drowning himself in alcohol, so we can stop that.

536
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,790
Why is that so difficult?

537
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:42,160
He got divorced, not terminally ill.

538
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,260
Why do we need to take care of him?

539
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:48,200
Okay, fine. He can leave, but I'm kicking you out too.

540
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:50,530
What? Why?

541
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,470
It's my house, not yours.

542
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:55,640
I let you live there rent-free, but you're acting like the owner.

543
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:58,170
Who are you to dictate whom I give my room out to?

544
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:01,440
You're really his mom, aren't you? Only that would make sense.

545
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,850
I actually wouldn't mind swapping kids.

546
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:06,850
Now, hang up. I need to get back to my workout.

547
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:26,670
The stage of childbirth?

548
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:29,500
The government is supporting more infertile couples now,

549
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,870
so I thought we could choose an infertile couple,

550
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:34,410
have the government pay for the procedure,

551
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:37,010
and write an in-depth piece until they give birth.

552
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:39,150
Sounds great.

553
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:42,680
You know the program where one experiences pregnancy?

554
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:45,650
My superior actually suggested something new.

555
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:49,090
Should you accept it,

556
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:51,390
pitching your idea would become easier.

557
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,100
What's this new idea?

558
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,330
Fathers-to-be experiencing pregnancy is getting old.

559
00:38:57,530 --> 00:39:00,400
My superior quietly suggested...

560
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,610
how fresh it'd be for a journalist to write an in-depth piece...

561
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:06,110
on how it is to be pregnant.

562
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,350
Goodness.

563
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:13,750
Why me though?

564
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:20,360
Are you going to smile or not?

565
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:23,930
Must I go this far to bring in money for advertisement?

566
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:27,360
I'll make sure that everyone knows of your sacrifice.

567
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:31,700
Let's think of the bundle of joy in your oven and smile.

568
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:33,740
Smile!

569
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:37,340
- Its name is Unexpected. - My goodness.

570
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:39,310
That's a scary name for an unborn baby.

571
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:41,710
It's because the baby came to me unexpectedly.

572
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,750
Since that's the case, give me an unexpected smile.

573
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,010
Over here.

574
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:47,220
- All right. - Hurry.

575
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,750
- Smile! - Ha Ri, you look great.

576
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:51,520
- Over here. - Smile!

577
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,220
- Let's smile. - Ha Ri, smile.

578
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:55,860
- Smile. - That's the spirit.

579
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:01,530
- Do we have the shot? - Let's look.

580
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:02,860
How does it look?

581
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:06,170
It's good, right?

582
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,340
- Do we have it? We got it. - The one before is better.

583
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:23,720
Why not?

584
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:27,320
Leave it on. I'll wear it on my way home.

585
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,420
I'd rather have the full experience.

586
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,180
Are things all right at the studio?

587
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:51,150
It seems like he can barely hire you.

588
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:54,080
He's sharing the space to keep up with the rent.

589
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:57,590
- I heard I Sang's name. - Who?

590
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,120
Why? How do you two know each other?

591
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:01,760
- I don't know him. - They went on a blind date.

592
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:04,290
You two were set up on a date?

593
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:05,830
That's not the case.

594
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,560
He cursed her, you know.

595
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,470
He put a nail right through her heart.

596
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:11,530
What?

597
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:13,800
I truly believe that it's the reason why...

598
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,740
you haven't been able to date.

599
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,640
Must he really be mentioned at this moment?

600
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,040
I'm exhausted as it is, you know.

601
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:23,680
Just a second. Let's pose here.

602
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:33,420
I saw him once before, and he seemed okay.

603
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:35,790
He's a lunatic in disguise.

604
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:41,160
That's the guy?

605
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:45,470
Han I Sang. He's one of the hottest photographers right now,

606
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:47,600
and he's two years older than you.

607
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:51,740
How should I put this?

608
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:54,510
It seems like he has a story to tell.

609
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:57,580
Is that a deal-breaker?

610
00:41:57,610 --> 00:41:59,480
It'll be odd not to have one at that age.

611
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,250
No wonder my radar spotted him.

612
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,920
- Are you sure about this? - Not everyone is perfect.

613
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:05,550
All that matters is that he's sane.

614
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,360
Hold on a second then. I haven't talked to him...

615
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,090
- since he got back from overseas. - Sure.

616
00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:11,790
- Stay right here. - Got it.

617
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,240
I see you came ready for business.

618
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,570
Will you finally be getting married next year?

619
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:27,040
Well, if he's the right guy, then I'll sink my teeth in him.

620
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:31,050
Remember the woman I mentioned? She's right there.

621
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:42,920
What's wrong with her?

622
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:45,390
She's just shy, that's all.

623
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:48,360
I promised to set her up with a dashing bachelor.

624
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,170
I'm not interested in marriage.

625
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:52,370
Since when?

626
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:55,200
- This moment. - Why?

627
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:58,070
I should date him for a year before tying the knot, right?

628
00:42:58,970 --> 00:43:00,680
You haven't even met him yet.

629
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:03,580
Exactly. We'll meet today, date for a year,

630
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:05,110
and get married next year.

631
00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:06,620
Why must one get married?

632
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,220
Because it gets lonely.

633
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:09,380
Being single is easier.

634
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:10,820
How can you live without family?

635
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:13,790
I'd like a husband who I can call my best friend...

636
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:16,560
and have 2 sons and 2 daughters.

637
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,830
Since I'm too old though, I'll settle for two kids.

638
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:20,900
I'm not interested in a nagging wife.

639
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:22,530
I'd rather earn enough money for myself,

640
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:24,730
be clear of children invading my life,

641
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:27,940
and stick to having the TV to myself.

642
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,370
I hear you, so look into his eyes and have his gaze locked on you.

643
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:32,610
You know how an audience is like.

644
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:35,740
"Really? My goodness." Be excited about what he says.

645
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:37,880
While you do that,

646
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:40,050
touch him gently and subtly.

647
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:41,650
Touch him when we just met?

648
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:44,350
Ha Ri, touching is Flirting 101.

649
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:47,190
One lingering touch...

650
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:49,560
led to my first kiss with my husband.

651
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:50,630
A kiss?

652
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:53,330
But we're not even in love yet.

653
00:43:54,730 --> 00:43:58,070
Why do people value marriage as a priority?

654
00:43:58,070 --> 00:44:00,140
It's not just old-fashioned but despicable.

655
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:02,500
Are we cavemen trying to preserve our species?

656
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:05,110
Fine. Unbelievable.

657
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:06,780
I get it.

658
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:10,210
Let's not talk about it anymore, okay?

659
00:44:17,050 --> 00:44:19,790
Goodness, your biceps.

660
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:04,700
You must like the snow.

661
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:06,270
I do.

662
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:07,900
Me too.

663
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:11,410
- Mr. Nam... - Soo Chul...

664
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:15,240
I heard you're college alums with Mr. Nam.

665
00:45:18,350 --> 00:45:19,450
I am.

666
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:25,120
I'm Jang Ha Ri. I'm a reporter with "The Baby".

667
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:27,390
It's nice to meet you.

668
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:30,330
I see. It's nice for you. Same here.

669
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:37,730
One lingering touch led to my first kiss with my husband.

670
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:42,970
I hear you're a great photographer.

671
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:46,670
Is your expertise in magazine advertisements?

672
00:45:50,210 --> 00:45:51,350
What are you doing?

673
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:58,620
You made a big impression on me when I first saw you.

674
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:01,460
What's your deal?

675
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:04,790
- Pardon? - You have no fear.

676
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:06,730
What if I'm a bad guy?

677
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:09,960
You're not a bad guy.

678
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,030
You don't look like one.

679
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:13,470
I can tell.

680
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,810
Are you saying you can tell, so you fell in love at first sight?

681
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:20,680
If you felt like destiny was drawing you to me...

682
00:46:22,310 --> 00:46:23,550
That's even sillier.

683
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:27,320
Excuse me. All I did was introduce myself.

684
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:30,390
Who introduces themselves so aggressively?

685
00:46:31,150 --> 00:46:34,620
If you felt anything for me, it's desire triggered by hormones.

686
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:37,360
So don't hypnotize yourself with some romantic fantasy.

687
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:43,000
Wait, so...

688
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:46,270
are you saying I gave you...

689
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:48,740
a look filled with desire inviting you to do something?

690
00:46:50,410 --> 00:46:52,440
You're not all that.

691
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:57,480
Ms. Jang Ha Ri. I know we just met, but let me give you some advice.

692
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:01,780
If you're lonely,

693
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:09,590
get a dog.

694
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:27,810
I realized...

695
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,210
he was a real psycho.

696
00:47:33,950 --> 00:47:37,120
Do you have one with two stripes...

697
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:38,950
right around here?

698
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,790
No, that's the only design.

699
00:47:41,790 --> 00:47:45,890
It would be nice if the fabric had a sheen...

700
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:49,530
and some embroidery around here.

701
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:50,830
Do you have something like that?

702
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:54,870
- No, we don't. - I see.

703
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:56,840
You don't have much.

704
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:00,980
- That narcissistic pig. - Seriously.

705
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:03,210
Don't worry.

706
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,980
He's so popular, he's getting his own studio.

707
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:07,550
Thank goodness.

708
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:10,080
Even if I run into him and by chance he recognizes me,

709
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:11,520
I'll pretend I don't.

710
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:35,250
Darn it. I lost my timing to avoid him.

711
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:47,190
Get a dog.

712
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:25,330
Long time...

713
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:30,600
I almost said, "Long time no see."

714
00:49:36,110 --> 00:49:39,680
(Moai Stone Family Limited Release Pre-sale)

715
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:44,550
What did he say? Did he recognize you?

716
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:47,520
I ignored him first.

717
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:50,590
I thought you said something...

718
00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:53,720
- Hey. - Stop faking it.

719
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:56,090
No...

720
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:58,900
Again? Does it hurt a lot?

721
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:01,600
Go ahead.

722
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:03,030
I'll take some meds and head to the office.

723
00:50:03,030 --> 00:50:04,200
Give me that.

724
00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:06,140
Goodness.

725
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:09,240
What's wrong with her?

726
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:11,010
Menstrual cramps.

727
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:14,580
- Let's go. - But...

728
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:26,390
Darn it.

729
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:49,850
It's okay. Go on.

730
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:52,980
Gosh.

731
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:54,790
It was on sale.

732
00:50:54,790 --> 00:50:55,890
That was a good buy.

733
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:02,490
Oh, my gosh. I think her water broke!

734
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:05,700
Oh, no! You need to get to the hospital!

735
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:08,330
That's not it.

736
00:51:09,370 --> 00:51:11,400
She must be having contractions!

737
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:12,570
Should we call you an ambulance?

738
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:15,270
She should go to the hospital where her doctor is.

739
00:51:16,110 --> 00:51:17,880
The baby won't come right away. It's your first, right?

740
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:20,440
- No. That's not it... - Is it your second baby?

741
00:51:20,850 --> 00:51:23,480
- Don't they come faster? - They do.

742
00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:25,750
No, it's not a baby...

743
00:51:26,350 --> 00:51:27,890
It's her third!

744
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:31,820
Oh, my gosh! She's so tough! She's a real patriot!

745
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:34,330
- You need to get to a hospital. - No.

746
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:36,930
- Let's go. To the elevator. - No. That's not it.

747
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:40,030
- Elevator. - Elevator. Hurry!

748
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:42,700
- That's not it. - Why is it so slow?

749
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:45,240
- Let's take the escalator. - That's not it.

750
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:46,840
We should take the elevator.

751
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:49,070
But it isn't coming!

752
00:51:49,070 --> 00:51:52,210
- Move! She's having a baby! - Out of the way!

753
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:54,880
- Are you okay? - We're almost there.

754
00:51:54,950 --> 00:51:56,050
Oh, no.

755
00:51:56,150 --> 00:52:00,020
- Mister! Just a minute! - I'm not preg...

756
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:03,450
Mister! She's having contractions. Sorry.

757
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,020
Are you okay?

758
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:07,760
Okay, good. Excuse us.

759
00:52:08,030 --> 00:52:09,130
Okay.

760
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:14,870
"Mister"? I'm not that old.

761
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:22,240
- Hang in there. - I'm okay.

762
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:24,780
- You are not. - I'm fine.

763
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:26,940
- Oh, no. - Listen to me.

764
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:29,080
- My gosh. - Let me go.

765
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,450
- Please let go. - Where's our car?

766
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:35,890
I'm telling you, it's definitely that way!

767
00:52:35,890 --> 00:52:37,320
No, it's over here.

768
00:52:37,790 --> 00:52:39,620
Where is it?

769
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:41,860
Where? Hey. Where is it?

770
00:52:42,590 --> 00:52:45,200
- I'm telling you, it's this way. - That's not it.

771
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:47,800
- Hang on. - Listen to me.

772
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:50,130
They all look the same.

773
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,240
- Where is it? - That's not it.

774
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:54,610
Excuse me. Let me help.

775
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:06,380
Thank you!

776
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:08,220
That's great.

777
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:11,590
Good luck. Be strong!

778
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:16,530
- Where's your hospital? - Why are they doing this to me?

779
00:53:16,530 --> 00:53:17,930
Don't worry. I'll take you there.

780
00:53:17,930 --> 00:53:19,630
No, I'm okay.

781
00:53:21,830 --> 00:53:24,900
- Good luck! - Good luck!

782
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:26,600
My gosh.

783
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:41,020
My gosh. It hurts.

784
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:45,120
Are you okay? Where should I take you?

785
00:53:45,490 --> 00:53:47,690
Drop me off at any pharmacy.

786
00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:51,130
I don't think I should.

787
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,660
I'll take you to the nearest hospital.

788
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:55,170
No, I'm okay. I'm really...

789
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:04,840
Please... Please slow down.

790
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:11,950
My gosh, please let go!

791
00:54:11,950 --> 00:54:13,120
That hurts!

792
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:14,890
Gosh, let go of my hair!

793
00:54:14,990 --> 00:54:16,190
My goodness.

794
00:54:16,350 --> 00:54:17,920
Wait! Just a second!

795
00:54:18,890 --> 00:54:21,390
Her water broke!

796
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:28,530
I told you I'm fine.

797
00:54:29,930 --> 00:54:32,200
Gosh, okay. I'm sorry. I apologize.

798
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:34,710
Isn't she about to give birth any minute?

799
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:36,510
The doctor will be here soon.

800
00:54:38,110 --> 00:54:40,210
My gosh, please let me go!

801
00:54:41,550 --> 00:54:42,980
When did you start having contractions?

802
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,880
Gosh, I can't believe this.

803
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:46,620
- Let me check. - My gosh.

804
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:48,520
No. No.

805
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:50,690
Ma'am, you need to cooperate.

806
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:52,220
No. Don't.

807
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:54,730
- My gosh, it hurts. - My goodness.

808
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:00,730
Gosh, it hurts so much.

809
00:55:00,970 --> 00:55:03,530
Is she going to have the baby soon?

810
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:08,740
Get an ultrasound scanner ready.

811
00:55:09,470 --> 00:55:10,810
"An ultrasound"? Why?

812
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:12,480
May I talk to her guardian?

813
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:14,040
"Guardian"? I'm not her guardian.

814
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,850
I need to talk to you about...

815
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:20,750
Ms. Jang!

816
00:55:21,390 --> 00:55:22,750
Where are you going?

817
00:55:48,010 --> 00:55:49,080
Ms. Jang!

818
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:01,060
Ms. Jang.

819
00:56:02,290 --> 00:56:03,760
Ms. Jang, are you okay?

820
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,000
- Check her blood pressure. - Okay.

821
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:25,380
Gosh, what's on your face?

822
00:56:25,450 --> 00:56:27,490
Why aren't there any burp cloths?

823
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:33,020
There's one.

824
00:56:38,230 --> 00:56:41,400
Do Ah, I'll be right back. Wait right here.

825
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:42,870
I won't take long.

826
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,240
- What? - It looks like...

827
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,780
you have endometriosis.

828
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:55,850
If you take a look, these big bumps...

829
00:56:55,850 --> 00:56:58,420
are signs of endometriosis.

830
00:56:58,420 --> 00:57:00,080
And that's what caused the severe pain.

831
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:02,190
Why did you just endure the pain?

832
00:57:03,090 --> 00:57:04,790
Is it something really bad?

833
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:07,090
No, you'll be fine once you get surgery.

834
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:11,360
You also took the AMH test so you could freeze your eggs.

835
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:14,000
The test says your ovaries...

836
00:57:14,770 --> 00:57:16,100
are 40 years old.

837
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,100
To be honest, once you're past 35,

838
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:20,770
your ovaries aren't in the best condition.

839
00:57:21,170 --> 00:57:23,710
So I honestly don't recommend you to freeze your eggs.

840
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:27,210
You should've done it in your 20s or in your early 30s.

841
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:29,750
But you're 39, and it's too late.

842
00:57:32,150 --> 00:57:33,580
So is it impossible?

843
00:57:35,150 --> 00:57:37,890
In your case, it's going to be hard...

844
00:57:37,890 --> 00:57:40,220
to collect an egg that's healthy and is in its best condition.

845
00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:42,790
Even if we manage to freeze it,

846
00:57:42,790 --> 00:57:45,730
the egg could get damaged when it defrosts...

847
00:57:45,730 --> 00:57:47,300
and gets fertilized.

848
00:57:49,630 --> 00:57:51,200
Is there no way?

849
00:57:51,770 --> 00:57:54,170
The chance for you to get naturally get pregnant...

850
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:57,140
is below seven percent.

851
00:57:58,510 --> 00:58:02,010
Once you reach your 40s, it goes down to five percent.

852
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:04,750
And once you're over 43 years old, the success rate for IVF...

853
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:06,950
drops low to less than 10 percent.

854
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:08,720
There's a 90 percent chance...

855
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,590
that you could have a miscarriage before you're 10 weeks pregnant.

856
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:18,400
Does that mean I won't ever be able to have a baby?

857
00:58:19,430 --> 00:58:20,560
Is it impossible for me?

858
00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:25,540
It's already hard for you to get pregnant.

859
00:58:25,970 --> 00:58:28,710
But if you get an endometriosis surgery,

860
00:58:28,710 --> 00:58:31,380
you can't get pregnant for a year since you'll be taking drugs.

861
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:35,310
You lose eggs every month, so what will happen after a year?

862
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:37,880
Your chance of getting pregnant will get even lower.

863
00:58:50,830 --> 00:58:51,930
The pharmacy.

864
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,170
I need to go to the pharmacy.

865
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:01,310
- Hello? - Where are you?

866
00:59:01,310 --> 00:59:02,310
Why aren't you back yet?

867
00:59:02,970 --> 00:59:04,210
I'm...

868
00:59:10,110 --> 00:59:11,180
I don't know where I am.

869
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:29,870
I'm sure she brought some clothes from work.

870
00:59:35,570 --> 00:59:38,640
Here... It should be here.

871
00:59:44,850 --> 00:59:49,220
(Shoes that will take my baby to only the best places)

872
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:58,060
(A baby bottle that will help my baby grow tall)

873
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:40,670
(Write down what you want to be when you grow up.)

874
01:00:43,210 --> 01:00:44,810
Enjoy your food.

875
01:00:44,810 --> 01:00:46,440
- Okay. - Okay.

876
01:00:48,810 --> 01:00:51,780
You can be rich and extremely smart,

877
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:55,050
but no one can ever beat someone who's happy.

878
01:00:55,450 --> 01:00:58,060
That's because being happy is the hardest thing in the world.

879
01:00:58,390 --> 01:01:01,560
But I hope you'll be able to achieve that, Ha Ri.

880
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:10,330
(Mom)

881
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:12,940
"Mom"?

882
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:16,310
You're the happiest person in the world.

883
01:01:16,510 --> 01:01:18,310
You always smile every time you see a baby.

884
01:01:18,510 --> 01:01:21,080
Every kid likes their mom.

885
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:24,150
My dream is to become a mom.

886
01:01:25,350 --> 01:01:27,750
(Mom)

887
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:48,640
Ms. Jang, what are you doing here?

888
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:52,840
I'm... I'm looking for a pharmacy.

889
01:02:03,550 --> 01:02:05,890
This can't be the end.

890
01:02:08,590 --> 01:02:10,490
But why does it feel like it's all over?

891
01:02:17,770 --> 01:02:18,970
No, it can't be.

892
01:02:23,970 --> 01:02:25,380
Do you want to marry me?

893
01:03:07,850 --> 01:03:10,850
(Oh My Baby)

894
01:03:10,850 --> 01:03:12,990
I'm about to turn 40.

895
01:03:12,990 --> 01:03:15,660
And I learned that it takes effort to date and get married.

896
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:18,730
Jae Young, try to spend some time with her.

897
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:21,400
Then you guys might grow feelings for each other.

898
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:24,500
- Hey! - I don't think this will work.

899
01:03:24,670 --> 01:03:25,840
That's just our fate.

900
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:28,710
Should I set you up with someone in return for the gift?

901
01:03:28,710 --> 01:03:32,180
We're all destined to meet someone. Don't search too far away.

902
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:34,400
- Find someone nearby. - Ha Ri!

903
01:03:34,610 --> 01:03:38,340
You told me I'll fall for you.
