<b>What?</b>

<b>- Why are you picking a fight? - I'm not.</b>

<b>- You are. - Yes. I mean, no.</b>

<b>I'm regretting what?</b>

176

<b>What happened in the mountains.</b>

177
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:18,380
<b>If you think it was a mistake,</b>

178
00:22:18,387 --> 00:22:21,375
<b>that's fine with me. I don't want things to be awkward.</b>

<b>It's nothing much.</b>

<b>By the time your book is published,</b>

<b>Yes, he came with a really pretty girl.</b>

<b>It seemed like they were going out.</b>

263
00:28:20,148 --> 00:28:22,210
<b>I guess it would be inappropriate to ask him to dinner.</b>

<b>Oh, that noodle restaurant?</b>

273
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:43,225
<b>Yes, I know the place.</b>

<b>You've aged quite a bit, Myeong Yeo.</b>

<b>Do you still cry often?</b>

279
00:29:00,222 --> 00:29:02,890
<b>Do you still curse in public?</b>

280
00:29:02,891 --> 00:29:03,990
<b>I heard you got divorced.</b>

281
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:06,045
<b>Yes, three times.</b>

282
00:29:06,394 --> 00:29:07,820
<b>I envy your reckless life.</b>

283

<b>Reckless?</b>

284

<b>I think I saw you in front of my house. Am I wrong?</b>

<b>Do you have eyes on the back of your head or what?</b>

289

<b>Haven't you ever thought your clothes are a bit unusual?</b>

290

<b>how big your house was.</b>

294

<b>It was really big. Do you pay rent?</b>

295

<b>No, I own the place.</b>

<b>Are you going out now?</b>

<b>- Hold on. - What?</b>

301
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:17,285
<b>Wear a muffler.</b>

302
00:30:17,465 --> 00:30:19,825
<b>- A muffler? - It's cold.</b>

303
00:30:20,769 --> 00:30:23,670
<b>No, there's no need. It's fine.</b>

304
00:30:23,672 --> 00:30:26,925
<b>It's not even cold. I'll be fine.</b>

305

<b>You're meeting the people from the mall, right?</b>

306

<b>Yes, I am.</b>

307
00:30:32,314 --> 00:30:35,505
<b>Then you should tell them.</b>

308
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:37,605
<b>When...</b>

<b>someone goes missing in the mountains,</b>

310

<b>Oh, that... That's...</b>

312

00:31:01,476 --> 00:31:04,880
<b>What do they need Eun Seop for?</b>

318
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:09,635
<b>Well, that is true, but...</b>

319
00:31:11,553 --> 00:31:15,375
<b>Last time, when he suddenly disappeared,</b>

320
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:18,475
<b>do you know why he went to the mountain?</b>

321
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:24,915
<b>He said he saw that woman.</b>

322
00:31:26,201 --> 00:31:28,000
<b>That woman?</b>

323
00:31:28,003 --> 00:31:29,555
<b>Yes.</b>

324
00:31:30,038 --> 00:31:33,100
<b>He saw an illusion of her and followed her.</b>

325
00:31:33,108 --> 00:31:35,765
<b>He had no choice but to follow her.</b>

326
00:31:36,711 --> 00:31:38,865
<b>How could that...</b>

327
00:31:39,915 --> 00:31:41,380
<b>She's dead.</b>

328
00:31:41,383 --> 00:31:43,275
<b>I know.</b>

329
00:31:46,955 --> 00:31:49,790
<b>I was worried our son...</b>

330
00:31:49,791 --> 00:31:53,545
<b>might be possessed by the mountain.</b>

331
00:31:55,096 --> 00:31:57,615
<b>I felt scared.</b>

332
00:32:02,771 --> 00:32:06,595
<b>Okay. I'll go tell them.</b>

333
00:32:07,142 --> 00:32:08,695
<b>Really?</b>

334
00:32:09,044 --> 00:32:12,065
<b>Yes, I'll go tell them today.</b>

335
00:32:12,147 --> 00:32:13,810
<b>Thank you, Honey.</b>

336
00:32:13,815 --> 00:32:15,805
<b>Don't worry about it.</b>

337
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:18,850
<b>You should wear a muffler.</b>

338
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:22,005
<b>There's no need. I might lose it.</b>

339
00:32:25,293 --> 00:32:27,620
<b>I heard you're publishing a book.</b>

340
00:32:27,629 --> 00:32:29,085
<b>So?</b>

341
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:31,355
<b>I'm publishing one too.</b>

342
00:32:31,833 --> 00:32:32,830
<b>So what?</b>

343
00:32:32,834 --> 00:32:35,100
<b>Your publishing company was trying so hard...</b>

344
00:32:35,103 --> 00:32:39,495
<b>to find out the publishing date of my book. Did you know?</b>

345
00:32:40,508 --> 00:32:43,770
<b>Since I'm here and all, I meant to ask you.</b>

346
00:32:43,778 --> 00:32:45,040
<b>When are you publishing your book?</b>

347
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:47,405
<b>When you publish yours.</b>

348
00:32:49,517 --> 00:32:52,505
<b>I've already finished writing the manuscript,</b>

349
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:55,845
<b>so I can publish it whenever I want.</b>

350
00:32:55,857 --> 00:32:57,415
<b>Isn't that nice?</b>

351
00:32:58,827 --> 00:33:01,190
<b>I'm going to publish it on the same date...</b>

352
00:33:01,196 --> 00:33:03,485
<b>your book comes out.</b>

353
00:33:03,765 --> 00:33:05,355
<b>Is this revenge?</b>

354
00:33:05,767 --> 00:33:07,360
<b>What a cheap move.</b>

355
00:33:07,369 --> 00:33:08,930
<b>You weren't as good as me at writing...</b>

356
00:33:08,937 --> 00:33:10,130
<b>and no one acknowledged you during college.</b>

357
00:33:10,138 --> 00:33:13,125
<b>I never imagined you'd get back at me like this.</b>

358
00:33:13,508 --> 00:33:14,900
<b>You shouldn't be doing this...</b>

359
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:17,510
<b>when you own a house in the middle of Seoul.</b>

360
00:33:17,512 --> 00:33:19,510
<b>How pathetic.</b>

361
00:33:19,514 --> 00:33:21,310
<b>You were pathetic back then,</b>

362
00:33:21,316 --> 00:33:23,535
<b>and you're still pathetic.</b>

363
00:33:24,552 --> 00:33:28,845
<b>Then why don't you publish your book through our company?</b>

364
00:33:30,458 --> 00:33:31,945
<b>What?</b>

365
00:33:33,461 --> 00:33:37,285
<b>Your book. Let our company publish it.</b>

366
00:33:37,465 --> 00:33:39,155
<b>I'll make sure it happens.</b>

367
00:33:39,167 --> 00:33:40,685
<b>In return,</b>

368
00:33:41,002 --> 00:33:44,555
<b>how about you write a novel based on your life...</b>

369
00:33:44,873 --> 00:33:46,695
<b>since college?</b>

370
00:33:48,209 --> 00:33:49,635
<b>How about it?</b>

371
00:33:50,311 --> 00:33:51,735
<b>Okay?</b>

372
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:57,850
<b>There's an old saying that wise men...</b>

373
00:33:57,852 --> 00:34:02,345
<b>relieved their hangovers by eating noodles.</b>

374
00:34:02,524 --> 00:34:05,485
<b>Is that what that sign on the wall means?</b>

375
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:07,990
<b>It's nice to meet you.</b>

376
00:34:07,996 --> 00:34:10,630
<b>I've heard a lot about you, but it's the first time we get to meet.</b>

377
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:12,830
<b>Me too. It's nice to meet you.</b>

378
00:34:12,834 --> 00:34:14,760
<b>You take after your mother.</b>

379
00:34:14,769 --> 00:34:15,970
<b>I do?</b>

380
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:18,400
<b>- We have different personalities. - I don't think so.</b>

381
00:34:18,406 --> 00:34:20,170
<b>It seems similar to me.</b>

382
00:34:20,175 --> 00:34:21,640
<b>Really?</b>

383
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:24,695
<b>- Watch out. - Oh, gosh. I'm sorry.</b>

384
00:34:25,413 --> 00:34:27,110
<b>- Are you okay? - I'm okay.</b>

385
00:34:27,115 --> 00:34:30,250
<b>- Hae Won has her charms and flaws. - Is that so?</b>

386
00:34:30,251 --> 00:34:31,610
<b>Although I haven't met her mother...</b>

387
00:34:31,619 --> 00:34:33,780
<b>Hey, look who it is. Aren't you Jang Woo?</b>

388
00:34:33,788 --> 00:34:35,850
<b>Sir, hello.</b>

389
00:34:35,857 --> 00:34:37,220
<b>Oh, boy.</b>

390
00:34:37,225 --> 00:34:39,760
<b>- It's nice to see you. - Hello, sir.</b>

391
00:34:39,761 --> 00:34:41,660
<b>- Hello. - It smells like alcohol.</b>

392
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:43,330
<b>It smells like I drank a lot of soju.</b>

393
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:44,830
<b>I haven't met Hae Won's mother...</b>

394
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:46,960
<b>By the way, how's your dad doing?</b>

395
00:34:46,968 --> 00:34:49,770
<b>Oh, my dad? He's doing well.</b>

396
00:34:49,771 --> 00:34:51,700
<b>Yes. Have a good time.</b>

397
00:34:51,706 --> 00:34:54,225
<b>- Good to see you. - Me too.</b>

398
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:58,095
<b>What do I do? I'll reek of alcohol.</b>

399
00:34:59,647 --> 00:35:04,275
<b>Guys, I guess I wasn't mistaken earlier, was I?</b>

400
00:35:04,652 --> 00:35:08,080
<b>I mean, you two... What is going on here?</b>

401
00:35:08,089 --> 00:35:10,320
<b>Gosh, must you ask?</b>

402
00:35:10,325 --> 00:35:12,260
<b>Even this old man can tell...</b>

403
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:14,220
<b>that they'll probably get married soon.</b>

404
00:35:14,229 --> 00:35:15,530
<b>My gosh, sir. Please.</b>

405
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,015
<b>Sorry?</b>

406
00:35:18,066 --> 00:35:20,485
<b>Hey, man. What is going on?</b>

407
00:35:20,735 --> 00:35:22,155
<b>What?</b>

408
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:25,840
<b>I can't believe you. You're really something.</b>

409
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,370
<b>Hey, just drink.</b>

410
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:29,835
<b>Don't mind them, okay?</b>

411
00:35:31,579 --> 00:35:34,305
<b>Hey, so this is how that story ends?</b>

412
00:35:34,315 --> 00:35:36,380
<b>"That story"? What story?</b>

413
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,850
<b>What do you think? The story of him falling in love with you.</b>

414
00:35:38,853 --> 00:35:40,575
<b>Really?</b>

415
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:42,750
<b>Why? Do you want to hear it?</b>

416
00:35:42,757 --> 00:35:44,690
<b>Oh, I'm curious too.</b>

417
00:35:44,692 --> 00:35:46,360
<b>Don't be. He's just talking nonsense.</b>

418
00:35:46,361 --> 00:35:47,960
<b>- Tell us. I want to hear it. - Hae Won.</b>

419
00:35:47,962 --> 00:35:51,130
<b>I think the story begins with the Mugunghwa train.</b>

420
00:35:51,132 --> 00:35:52,555
<b>Hey!</b>

421
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:55,155
<b>- Don't. - "Don't."</b>

<b>(Stop)</b>

425

<b>The Mugunghwa train and the maple trees.</b>

426
00:36:48,656 --> 00:36:52,585
<b>But to be honest, I don't remember exactly when that was.</b>

427
00:36:53,428 --> 00:36:56,485
<b>Back then, I went to the train station very often.</b>

428
00:36:58,066 --> 00:36:59,585
<b>I think...</b>

429

<b>it was the day when you ran away from home.</b>

430

<b>Hey, hurry up. Mr. Park is waiting.</b>

431

<b>Let's go.</b>

432
00:37:19,787 --> 00:37:24,415
<b>Then is that when you first fell for me?</b>

433
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:26,945
<b>No.</b>

434
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:29,085
<b>Then when was it?</b>

435
00:37:30,865 --> 00:37:33,360
<b>I had a crush on you a few times before that.</b>

<b>It was just one of those moments.</b>

<b>Why didn't you say anything in the past?</b>

<b>What's the problem now?</b>

00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:24,200
<b>What's wrong with asking him to help me find my dog?</b>

474
00:40:24,205 --> 00:40:26,300
<b>- Gosh. - And he found my dog!</b>

475
00:40:26,307 --> 00:40:27,940
<b>He got back safe and sound, so it's all good!</b>

476
00:40:27,942 --> 00:40:30,640
<b>Okay, but what will you do if he gets hurt?</b>

477
00:40:30,645 --> 00:40:32,410
<b>- If Eun Seop gets injured, - Goodness.</b>

478
00:40:32,413 --> 00:40:36,010
<b>- who will save him? - Please don't fight.</b>

479
00:40:36,017 --> 00:40:37,480
<b>You don't care because he's not your son.</b>

480
00:40:37,485 --> 00:40:40,050
<b>Is my son the town servant or what?</b>

481
00:40:40,054 --> 00:40:42,020
<b>- My son is also... - Goodness.</b>

482
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:44,550
<b>"My son"? Seriously?</b>

483
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:48,890
<b>Gosh, people will think that he's actually your son.</b>

484
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:49,890
<b>Break them up.</b>

485
00:40:49,897 --> 00:40:51,890
<b>- Hey, please. - Don't say that.</b>

486
00:40:51,899 --> 00:40:53,860
<b>What? It's true!</b>

487
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:57,500
<b>- Stop. - Everyone will think he's your son.</b>

488
00:40:57,505 --> 00:41:00,200
<b>Goodness, even I had totally forgotten about it.</b>

489
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:02,440
<b>The fact that he's not your child.</b>

490
00:41:02,443 --> 00:41:03,570
<b>Hey, enough.</b>

491
00:41:03,578 --> 00:41:08,340
<b>Gosh, where did you even find that street urchin?</b>

492
00:41:08,349 --> 00:41:10,105
<b>- Enough, seriously. - You...</b>

493
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:12,350
<b>- Father! - Gosh.</b>

494
00:41:12,353 --> 00:41:13,350
<b>- Break them up. - Father!</b>

495
00:41:13,354 --> 00:41:14,750
<b>My goodness.</b>

496
00:41:14,755 --> 00:41:16,450
<b>- Hey, you're here. - Father, don't do this.</b>

497
00:41:16,457 --> 00:41:17,520
<b>Let's go.</b>

498
00:41:17,525 --> 00:41:19,390
<b>- Let's get out of here. I'm sorry. - Hae Won.</b>

499
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:22,515
<b>- Let's go. - Take your dad home.</b>

500
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:25,315
<b>- Let's get out of here. - Let's go.</b>

501
00:41:28,536 --> 00:41:31,800
<b>Hey, we've known each other for 30 years.</b>

502
00:41:31,806 --> 00:41:33,300
<b>- And you treat me like this? - You piece of...</b>

503
00:41:33,307 --> 00:41:35,970
<b>- Gosh, Jong Pil. - Just get in the car.</b>

504
00:41:35,977 --> 00:41:38,565
<b>- Go home, Jong Pil. - Get home safely.</b>

505
00:41:39,113 --> 00:41:40,610
<b>I'm sorry, Hae Won.</b>

506
00:41:40,615 --> 00:41:42,035
<b>All right.</b>

507
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:43,835
<b>Sorry.</b>

508
00:42:01,536 --> 00:42:03,600
<b>What a disaster.</b>

509
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:06,225
<b>I feel like this happens once every few months.</b>

510
00:42:08,476 --> 00:42:10,165
<b>How's Eun Seop's dad?</b>

511
00:42:10,344 --> 00:42:11,765
<b>Is he okay?</b>

512
00:42:15,416 --> 00:42:17,205
<b>Jang Woo, did you...</b>

513
00:42:43,711 --> 00:42:47,435
<b>Don't say anything to your dad.</b>

514
00:42:53,421 --> 00:42:56,615
<b>When he told me he was heading out to meet up with those friends,</b>

515
00:42:57,291 --> 00:42:59,715
<b>I egged him on...</b>

516
00:43:01,896 --> 00:43:05,085
<b>to tell them not to make you climb the mountains again.</b>

517
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:15,995
<b>I won't say anything.</b>

518
00:43:25,886 --> 00:43:27,575
<b>Thanks.</b>

519
00:43:50,978 --> 00:43:54,065
<b>Was it when I was in 2nd or 3rd grade?</b>

520
00:43:54,615 --> 00:43:56,335
<b>One day, out of the blue,</b>

521
00:43:57,018 --> 00:44:00,175
<b>an aggressive kid appeared at school.</b>

522
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:06,045
<b>That was Eun Seop.</b>

523
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:22,525
<b>What are you doing? Let's go play soccer.</b>

524
00:44:24,445 --> 00:44:25,895
<b>Oh, right.</b>

525
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:28,735
<b>Apparently, that kid was brought to town by a wolf.</b>

526
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:31,805
<b>People were saying...</b>

527
00:44:31,819 --> 00:44:34,580
<b>he used to live in the mountains and was raised by animals.</b>

528
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:36,950
<b>Let's go. Hurry up!</b>

529
00:44:36,957 --> 00:44:40,285
<b>- Hey! - Why did they say those things?</b>

530
00:44:42,396 --> 00:44:44,890
<b>- There's a fight going on. - Let's check it out.</b>

531
00:44:44,899 --> 00:44:47,330
<b>Break them up! Hey, we should break them up!</b>

532
00:44:47,334 --> 00:44:50,330
<b>- What are you talking about? - Break them up!</b>

533
00:44:50,337 --> 00:44:52,170
<b>- What should we do? - That must hurt.</b>

534
00:44:52,173 --> 00:44:53,540
<b>My mom said...</b>

535
00:44:53,541 --> 00:44:56,795
<b>- your dad is a hobo. - No, he isn't.</b>

536
00:44:57,645 --> 00:44:59,810
<b>She said you were abandoned by animals.</b>

537
00:44:59,814 --> 00:45:01,410
<b>You're a street urchin!</b>

538
00:45:01,415 --> 00:45:04,175
<b>No, that's not true!</b>

539
00:45:07,354 --> 00:45:09,445
<b>Eun Seop's real father was...</b>

540
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:12,345
<b>a vagrant living in the mountains.</b>

541
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:14,860
<b>A vagrant living in the mountains?</b>

542
00:45:14,862 --> 00:45:16,315
<b>Yes.</b>

543
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,255
<b>So that's why...</b>

544
00:45:22,236 --> 00:45:24,755
<b>Yes, that's why.</b>

545
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:29,465
<b>What happened to Eun Seop's real father?</b>

546
00:45:30,745 --> 00:45:34,635
<b>Well... I guess he died.</b>

547
00:45:35,883 --> 00:45:38,005
<b>I don't know exactly.</b>

548
00:45:38,085 --> 00:45:41,705
<b>As you know, Eun Seop never talks about those things.</b>

549
00:45:45,626 --> 00:45:47,985
<b>I've never seen a wooden headstone.</b>

550
00:45:48,129 --> 00:45:50,285
<b>Do you know whose grave is this?</b>

551
00:45:52,133 --> 00:45:53,430
<b>"Kim Gil..."</b>

552
00:45:53,434 --> 00:45:56,195
<b>The story about the wolf's silver eyelash...</b>

553
00:45:59,106 --> 00:46:01,725
<b>This grave belongs to the person who told me that story.</b>

554
00:46:18,559 --> 00:46:20,460
<b>Dad!</b>

555
00:46:20,461 --> 00:46:22,630
<b>I want a new bike that can speed up to 80km per hour.</b>

556
00:46:22,630 --> 00:46:24,160
<b>I need to ride real fast.</b>

557
00:46:24,165 --> 00:46:26,630
<b>Or please at least change my saddle.</b>

558
00:46:26,634 --> 00:46:29,755
<b>My bottom hurts so much these days. Dad!</b>

559
00:46:30,704 --> 00:46:32,255
<b>What are you staring at?</b>

560
00:46:34,775 --> 00:46:36,295
<b>Oh, right.</b>

561
00:46:41,015 --> 00:46:43,235
<b>You had it with you?</b>

562
00:46:43,818 --> 00:46:46,020
<b>I've been taking other people's wallets for the past 18 years,</b>

563
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:47,680
<b>but I've never seen anyone like you.</b>

564
00:46:47,688 --> 00:46:50,345
<b>You don't even look for your wallet.</b>

565
00:46:51,725 --> 00:46:53,560
<b>Next time, tell me beforehand.</b>

566
00:46:53,561 --> 00:46:55,045
<b>Gosh.</b>

567
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:21,705
<b>Is that...</b>

568
00:47:22,356 --> 00:47:24,215
<b>your dad?</b>

569
00:47:27,194 --> 00:47:30,685
<b>I mean, he looks a bit like you.</b>

570
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:37,025
<b>Eun Seop.</b>

571
00:47:38,072 --> 00:47:42,225
<b>Why don't you throw that picture away?</b>

572
00:47:42,843 --> 00:47:44,265
<b>What?</b>

573
00:47:44,378 --> 00:47:47,510
<b>You're carrying around a picture of someone I don't know.</b>

574
00:47:47,514 --> 00:47:49,935
<b>It makes me jealous.</b>

575
00:47:50,584 --> 00:47:52,605
<b>You're jealous?</b>

576
00:47:54,321 --> 00:47:55,680
<b>Hey.</b>

577
00:47:55,689 --> 00:47:58,145
<b>I'm serious.</b>

578
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:00,045
<b>Okay.</b>

579
00:48:01,061 --> 00:48:04,230
<b>What's with you? Have you lost your mind? Gosh.</b>

580
00:48:04,231 --> 00:48:06,260
<b>Dad, there's something wrong with Eun Seop!</b>

581
00:48:06,267 --> 00:48:08,260
<b>He laughs to himself these days.</b>

582
00:48:08,269 --> 00:48:10,825
<b>What's with him? That ugly fool.</b>

583
00:48:20,648 --> 00:48:23,075
<b>Did I ever tell you?</b>

584
00:48:28,856 --> 00:48:30,275
<b>That I...</b>

585
00:48:32,026 --> 00:48:34,715
<b>used to be really happy.</b>

586
00:48:49,476 --> 00:48:52,040
<b>Daddy, hurry up!</b>

587
00:48:52,046 --> 00:48:55,040
<b>Kid, you're way too fast.</b>

588
00:48:55,049 --> 00:48:58,935
<b>I can't keep up with you anymore.</b>

589
00:49:23,978 --> 00:49:26,565
<b>Hey, a boar appeared.</b>

590
00:49:26,647 --> 00:49:27,880
<b>Where?</b>

591
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:29,510
<b>Just kidding.</b>

592
00:49:29,516 --> 00:49:32,105
<b>Daddy.</b>

593
00:49:36,123 --> 00:49:39,420
<b>Today, I'll teach you how to chop wood. Let's go.</b>

594
00:49:39,426 --> 00:49:41,890
<b>- Really? - Yes. Today,</b>

595
00:49:41,895 --> 00:49:44,060
<b>you're finally going to become a man.</b>

596
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:45,660
<b>It's cold. Put on your jacket.</b>

597
00:49:45,666 --> 00:49:48,685
<b>Let's go. Let's do this.</b>

598
00:50:00,914 --> 00:50:02,735
<b>Daddy!</b>

599
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:06,335
<b>I caught a beetle.</b>

600
00:50:10,524 --> 00:50:12,375
<b>Daddy?</b>

601
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:28,125
<b>And then one day,</b>

602
00:50:31,478 --> 00:50:33,040
<b>all my happiness...</b>

603
00:50:33,047 --> 00:50:35,565
<b>suddenly disappeared.</b>

604
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:56,995
<b>This moment</b>

605
00:51:27,568 --> 00:51:29,930
<b>Now that you're getting washed up,</b>

606
00:51:29,937 --> 00:51:33,795
<b>you look so handsome.</b>

607
00:51:34,575 --> 00:51:36,810
<b>What's your name? What do you want to eat?</b>

608
00:51:36,810 --> 00:51:38,140
<b>What should I make for you?</b>

609
00:51:38,145 --> 00:51:40,510
<b>- Do you want some tteokbokki? - Gosh, it's cold.</b>

610
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:42,510
<b>- Almost all the stores were closed. - My goodness.</b>

611
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:45,380
<b>Close the door. The boy will catch a cold.</b>

612
00:51:45,385 --> 00:51:47,850
<b>I hope they fit him.</b>

613
00:51:47,855 --> 00:51:49,180
<b>- Goodness. - My gosh.</b>

614
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:52,120
<b>I should have come with you.</b>

615
00:51:52,126 --> 00:51:54,090
<b>They will do for tonight.</b>

616
00:51:54,094 --> 00:51:57,060
<b>We can go to bigger stores tomorrow.</b>

617
00:51:57,064 --> 00:51:59,585
<b>I would have expected to become unhappy right away,</b>

618
00:52:01,568 --> 00:52:04,355
<b>but I didn't, which made me even more anxious.</b>

619
00:52:05,906 --> 00:52:07,395
<b>So...</b>

620
00:52:08,108 --> 00:52:10,665
<b>I ended up fearing...</b>

621
00:52:10,978 --> 00:52:13,165
<b>all the happiness in the world.</b>

622
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:30,485
<b>How come you're not afraid to go into the woods at night?</b>

623
00:52:31,498 --> 00:52:33,925
<b>Do you see all the trails or something?</b>

624
00:52:34,935 --> 00:52:37,095
<b>I know the place like the back of my hand.</b>

625
00:52:41,275 --> 00:52:42,795
<b>I know it very well.</b>

626
00:52:43,343 --> 00:52:45,795
<b>Never come up here again.</b>

627
00:52:46,547 --> 00:52:48,065
<b>Even if I...</b>

628
