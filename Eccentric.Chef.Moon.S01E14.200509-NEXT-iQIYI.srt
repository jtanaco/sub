<b>[ Episode 14 ]</b>

2
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:34,945
<b>I'm here now.</b>

3
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:38,255
<b>[ - What about Mr. Jin? ]
- I don't see him yet.</b>

4
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,925
<b>- I'll wait here.
[ - Be careful. ]</b>

5
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,025
<b>Will do.</b>

6
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:56,335
<b>Is that Mr. Jin?</b>

7
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:18,425
<b>What is going on?</b>

8
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,765
<b>What brings you to a place like this,
Chef Moon?</b>

9
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:26,165
<b>At a place that doesn't suit you,</b>

10
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,235
<b>with a bag like that?</b>

11
00:01:30,939 --> 00:01:33,705
<b>I don't think the person
you are waiting for will come.</b>

12
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,745
<b>- What did you do with Mr. Jin?
- Well.</b>

13
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,415
<b>How should I know?</b>

14
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,355
<b>Did you kill him?</b>

15
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:49,325
<b>Chef Moon.</b>

16
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,365
<b>I'm not the type of person
to go around killing people.</b>

17
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,765
<b>I guess I could seriously consider it</b>

18
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:01,905
<b>if there happened to be a good reason.</b>

19
00:02:03,909 --> 00:02:05,075
<b>So</b>

20
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,075
<b>you even killed Mr. Jin</b>

21
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,245
<b>to cover the evidence?</b>

22
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:13,749
<b>Maybe it's because of your job,</b>

23
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,255
<b>but you have such a wild imagination.</b>

24
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,414
<b>And Pungcheonok.</b>

25
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,755
<b>You're the one</b>

26
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,495
<b>who set Pungcheonok on fire.</b>

27
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,165
<b>Why did you do it?</b>

28
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,005
<b>Why?</b>

29
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:42,074
<b>My mother and father... Why?</b>

30
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:49,285
<b>Why did you do it?</b>

31
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,085
<b>Why?</b>

32
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,695
<b>You bastard!</b>

33
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:03,995
<b>[ Seriously! ]</b>

34
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:20,885
<b>Let's go.</b>

35

<b>[ Chef Moon. ]</b>

36

<b>Nothing's</b>

<b>going on, right?</b>

41
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:07,625
<b>[ No. Of course not. ]</b>

42
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,965
<b>[ - Why? ]
- Never mind, then.</b>

43
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:15,205
<b>I just wanted to hear your voice.</b>

44
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,035
<b>[ It's getting late. Go to bed. ]</b>

45
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,735
<b>When will you be here?</b>

46
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,145
<b>I'm not sure yet.</b>

47
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:23,315
<b>It might take a bit longer.</b>

48
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,415
<b>[ Okay. Don't worry about us, ]</b>

49

<b>[ and take care of the business

50
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:31,385
<b>Okay.</b>

51
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,645
<b>What do you mean, Lim Chul-yong was there?</b>

52
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:57,015
<b>I don't understand it, either.</b>

53
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,015
<b>I think we've been tracked.</b>

54
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,615
<b>How could he have known?</b>

55
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,925
<b>Yes, sir.</b>

56
00:05:08,059 --> 00:05:09,255
<b>I took care of it.</b>

57
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:12,395
<b>All right. Good job.</b>

58
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:14,025
<b>I knew it.</b>

59
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,665
<b>Everything went smoothly
because you took care of it.</b>

60
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:20,305
<b>[ Go and get some rest for a few days, ]</b>

61
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:22,775
<b>and come straight to work

<b>[ Mr. Kang Jun-su ]</b>

00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,045
<b>What?</b>

66
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,859
<b>[ This morning,

<b>[ by the mountains near Pyeongtaek. ]</b>

70

<b>[ Mr. Jin and Mr. Hong were found to have

<b>[ with no signs of murder. ]</b>

<b>[ A will was found on-site, ]</b>

73

<b>[ therefore, the police are assuming

<b>[ took their own lives out of despair

<b>[ therefore, the police are assuming

79
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:57,695
<b>Lim Chul-yong showed up</b>

80
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,035
<b>at the site.</b>

81
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,375
<b>How could he have known?</b>

82
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:07,904
<b>Mother.</b>

<b>[ Mother ]</b>

<b>- Yes, Mother.

<b>[ I want to go with you tomorrow

<b>It's dangerous. You shouldn't.</b>

88
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:22,825
<b>And there's been a change of schedule.</b>

89
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:25,125
<b>I think Lim Chul-yong is tracking us.</b>

<b>We advanced it to tonight.</b>

91

<b>Do you understand what you've done?</b>

92
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:39,545
<b>Why did you give him the information?
Just why?</b>

93
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:41,875
<b>[ I told you. ]</b>

94

<b>[ It was to protect you. ]</b>

96

<b>He said he would kill you as well.</b>

97
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,025
<b>What was I supposed to do?</b>

98
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,795
<b>Mother.</b>

99

<b>Jun-su.</b>

<b>Don't fight Lim Chul-yong.</b>

<b>Please.</b>

<b>Please!</b>

103

<b>Wait! One moment!</b>

104

<b>What now?</b>

105
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:41,435
<b>Are you going to follow us to jail?</b>

106
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,534
<b>Mr. Jin and Hong Joo-hyuk</b>

<b>died last night.</b>

00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,215
<b>What?</b>

109
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:55,545
<b>Who was it?</b>

110
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,125
<b>What on earth is someone trying to hide

<b>You're the only one left now.</b>

<b>Come on, tell us the truth. Please?</b>

<b>"Mr. Jung"?</b>

<b>[ We don't know his name, ]</b>

115

<b>but Oh Jung-tae overheard</b>

116

<b>Mr. Jin often mentioning Mr. Jung
from Donghan Group.</b>

<b>Was he the one who ordered
to kidnap Yu-jin</b>

118
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,975
<b>and set Pungcheonok on fire?</b>

<b>Was it all from that Mr. Jung?</b>

120

<b>Yes.</b>

121
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,299
<b>Hey, Mr. Choi.</b>

<b>[ Yes, Chef Moon. ]</b>

<b>I went around and checked for just in case</b>

124
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:41,795
<b>after hearing from you.</b>

125

<b>That Mr. Jung took his day off

<b>Can you find out Mr. Jung's

127
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,175
<b>Sure, will do right away.</b>

128
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:30,015
<b>[ What are you here for? ]</b>

129
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,815
<b>I'm the housekeeper here.</b>

130
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:36,515
<b>Is there something I can help?</b>

131
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,785
<b>I'm supposed to meet with him today.</b>

132
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,525
<b>Nobody's home.</b>

133
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:43,629
<b>The wife and kid are abroad.</b>

134
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:46,025
<b>The mister went out for work
early in the morning.</b>

135

<b>I see.</b>

136
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:56,975
<b>Oh Jung-tae spilled out everything.</b>

<b>Yu-jin's abduction and Pungcheonok's fire.</b>

138
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:02,245
<b>Mr. Jung was behind
all of these incidents.</b>

139
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:05,079
<b>Then Mr. Jung must be involved
with the murder</b>

140
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,745
<b>of Mr. Jin as well. Right?</b>

141
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:10,659
<b>He's not at home, and he's not at work.</b>

142
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,515
<b>I have no clue where he might be.</b>

143
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:15,125
<b>For now, finding Mr. Jung is our priority.</b>

144
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,295
<b>I'll do my best to figure things out.</b>

145
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,565
<b>I didn't expect Lim Chul-yong
to finish Mr. Jin like that.</b>

146

<b>Goodness.</b>

147
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:27,365
<b>I'm too ashamed to see Yu-jin now.</b>

148

<b>Don't be so hard on yourself.</b>

<b>Yu-jin's parents</b>

<b>didn't die because of you, Ms. Jang.</b>

151
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,745
<b>Lim Chul-yong did it.</b>

152
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,215
<b>What?</b>

153
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:51,495
<b>20 years ago,</b>

154
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,595
<b>Lim Chul-yong committed the murder

<b>My mother told me all about it.</b>

156
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:02,035
<b>How...</b>

157
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,135
<b>How could he do that?</b>

158
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,715

<b>What? Why are you getting worried?</b>

232
