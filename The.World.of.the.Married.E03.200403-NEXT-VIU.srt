<b>Didn't you miss me?</b>

3
00:00:19,981 --> 00:00:21,922
<b>We haven't met in a while. Let me see you smile.</b>

4
00:00:22,552 --> 00:00:24,021
<b>If you have nothing more to say, you should leave.</b>

5
00:00:24,751 --> 00:00:26,251
<b>I'm busy. I need to get back to work.</b>

6
00:00:31,361 --> 00:00:32,592
<b>Should we get married?</b>

7

<b>If you think you're responsible, don't ask.</b>

8

<b>It took a while for me to prepare everything.</b>

9

<b>You know I can't live without you.</b>

10

<b>Let's get married, Sun Woo.</b>

11
00:01:53,312 --> 00:01:56,142
<b>I promise I'll make you and our baby happy.</b>

12

<b>Let's live together.</b>

<b>Da Kyung!</b>

20

<b>What are you planning to do?</b>

21
00:03:48,091 --> 00:03:50,991
<b>Why do you want Tae Oh to know that she's pregnant?</b>

22
00:03:52,861 --> 00:03:54,732
<b>He should know. He's the father.</b>

23
00:03:55,531 --> 00:03:59,202
<b>He should take responsibility. It's only right.</b>

24
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:03,301
<b>What if he says he will? Do you plan to divorce him?</b>

25
00:04:05,572 --> 00:04:07,542
<b>- Is that what you want? - What?</b>

26
00:04:08,382 --> 00:04:10,042
<b>I'm worried about you.</b>

27
00:04:10,311 --> 00:04:11,452
<b>Don't worry about me.</b>

28
00:04:12,912 --> 00:04:14,452
<b>I'll decide whether or not to keep it.</b>

29
00:04:17,052 --> 00:04:18,151
<b>Okay.</b>

30
00:04:19,822 --> 00:04:21,562
<b>I'll leave it to you.</b>

31
00:04:21,562 --> 00:04:23,531
<b>It doesn't matter that I'm pregnant.</b>

32
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:26,791
<b>I won't use that as an excuse to latch onto you.</b>

33
00:04:28,262 --> 00:04:29,531
<b>Don't jump to conclusions.</b>

34
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:34,002
<b>What are you trying to confirm?</b>

35
00:04:34,471 --> 00:04:36,541
<b>I want to see Tae Oh choose.</b>

36
00:04:38,072 --> 00:04:40,442
<b>Not because we're married or because of Joon Young,</b>

37

<b>but me, Ji Sun Woo.</b>

38
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:50,322
<b>What matters is whether or not you love me.</b>

39
00:04:50,322 --> 00:04:52,952
<b>If not, what's the point of maintaining this marriage?</b>

40
00:04:55,721 --> 00:04:56,892
<b>Am I wrong?</b>

41
00:04:57,862 --> 00:04:59,091
<b>Sure.</b>

42
00:05:00,192 --> 00:05:03,671
<b>I'm sure he wouldn't choose her unless he has lost his mind.</b>

43
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:07,302
<b>I'm sure he'll end it. He will.</b>

44

<b>You know I can't live without you.</b>

45
00:05:26,122 --> 00:05:27,291
<b>I don't want to hide.</b>

46
00:05:27,892 --> 00:05:30,122
<b>I'm going to call whenever I want now.</b>

47
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:33,702
<b>I'll call more.</b>

48
00:05:33,702 --> 00:05:36,661
<b>- I'll see you whenever I want. - Of course.</b>

49
00:05:36,661 --> 00:05:38,531
<b>Don't you dare hang up on me again.</b>

50
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:41,242
<b>It'll really be over.</b>

51
00:05:43,471 --> 00:05:46,211
<b>I'll never do that. I promise.</b>

52
00:05:49,981 --> 00:05:51,112
<b>Trust me.</b>

53
00:05:52,312 --> 00:05:53,452
<b>Okay?</b>

54
00:05:56,221 --> 00:05:57,351
<b>Prove it.</b>

55
00:06:26,851 --> 00:06:28,521
<b>The infection worsened.</b>

56
00:06:28,981 --> 00:06:30,182
<b>Her BP is bad too.</b>

57
00:06:30,252 --> 00:06:31,952
<b>Aren't you giving her fentanyl?</b>

58
00:06:31,952 --> 00:06:34,221
<b>We're giving her the highest dosage. We can't up it any more.</b>

59
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:36,721
<b>If we do, her heart may stop...</b>

60
00:06:37,362 --> 00:06:38,831
<b>and she may fall into a coma.</b>

61
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:40,291
<b>Is there any other way?</b>

62
00:06:42,531 --> 00:06:45,802
<b>You know we've done everything we could...</b>

63
00:06:45,802 --> 00:06:46,971
<b>medically.</b>

64
00:06:54,711 --> 00:06:58,512
<b>Sorry for making you come...</b>

65
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,622
<b>when you're busy.</b>

66
00:07:03,921 --> 00:07:05,452
<b>Should I tell Tae Oh to come?</b>

67
00:07:06,052 --> 00:07:07,392
<b>It's okay.</b>

68
00:07:08,091 --> 00:07:11,291
<b>It's not like he can do anything even if he comes.</b>

69
00:07:12,892 --> 00:07:15,562
<b>Why cause him concern?</b>

70
00:07:15,932 --> 00:07:17,471
<b>I'll leave once you fall asleep.</b>

71
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:30,182
<b>With men,</b>

72
00:07:31,411 --> 00:07:34,021
<b>if you embrace them with a broad mind,</b>

73
00:07:35,682 --> 00:07:37,992
<b>they will get back to their senses eventually.</b>

74
00:07:39,591 --> 00:07:40,921
<b>You know...</b>

75
00:07:42,021 --> 00:07:45,661
<b>you and Joon Young are the world to Tae Oh.</b>

76
00:07:46,992 --> 00:07:50,771
<b>So... Even if I'm gone,</b>

77
00:07:51,932 --> 00:07:56,471
<b>please take good care of him. Please?</b>

78
00:08:00,142 --> 00:08:01,242
<b>Mother.</b>

79
00:08:11,392 --> 00:08:13,252
<b>I think you should go home, doctor.</b>

80
00:08:13,862 --> 00:08:15,661
<b>She needs to rest.</b>

81
00:09:49,821 --> 00:09:50,951
<b>You're home.</b>

82
00:09:58,031 --> 00:09:59,691
<b>Go wash your hands.</b>

83
00:09:59,892 --> 00:10:01,201
<b>Call Joon Young.</b>

84
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:29,392
<b>I forgot.</b>

85
00:10:33,931 --> 00:10:36,031
<b>Oil splatter doesn't wash off.</b>

86
00:10:36,832 --> 00:10:39,031
<b>Thanks. I'll be careful.</b>

87
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:52,752
<b>Were you able to resolve that urgent matter this morning?</b>

88
00:10:56,722 --> 00:10:58,551
<b>How long do you plan to keep it from her?</b>

89
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:04,031
<b>It's time to sell Sun Woo the truth and end it with Da Kyung.</b>

90
00:11:04,161 --> 00:11:06,492
<b>The moment Sun Woo finds out, it's over.</b>

91
00:11:06,691 --> 00:11:09,102
<b>She'll demand a divorce for sure. I can't tell her.</b>

92
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:11,901
<b>And she won't let me see Joon Young.</b>

93
00:11:13,671 --> 00:11:16,142
<b>I can't imagine a life without Sun Woo.</b>

94
00:11:16,701 --> 00:11:19,041
<b>Then end it with Da Kyung as soon as possible.</b>

95
00:11:24,411 --> 00:11:27,752
<b>Forget it. You'd never understand.</b>

96
00:11:28,722 --> 00:11:30,521
<b>What's so complicated?</b>

97
00:11:35,492 --> 00:11:36,762
<b>When I'm with her,</b>

98
00:11:39,392 --> 00:11:40,862
<b>I feel alive.</b>

99
00:11:42,931 --> 00:11:45,972
<b>My creativity gets going. I get inspired.</b>

100
00:11:47,901 --> 00:11:49,872
<b>I'm fond of her and cherish her.</b>

101
00:11:52,472 --> 00:11:53,612
<b>I love her.</b>

102
00:11:54,811 --> 00:11:57,281
<b>- What about Sun Woo? - Naturally, I love her too.</b>

103
00:11:57,451 --> 00:11:58,982
<b>What gibberish is that?</b>

104
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:02,051
<b>The human heart doesn't feel just one emotion.</b>

105
00:12:04,222 --> 00:12:07,421
<b>You don't stop loving just because you're married.</b>

106
00:12:07,821 --> 00:12:11,732
<b>My love for Sun Woo and my love for Da Kyung are different.</b>

107
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:13,191
<b>What drives me mad is...</b>

108
00:12:16,232 --> 00:12:18,431
<b>that I love them both at the same time.</b>

109
00:12:20,571 --> 00:12:22,502
<b>What insanity is this?</b>

110
00:12:23,401 --> 00:12:26,071
<b>How could you love two people at the same time?</b>

111
00:12:28,512 --> 00:12:31,082
<b>- Don't you think you're shameless? - You don't understand, do you?</b>

112
00:12:31,982 --> 00:12:33,752
<b>You wonder how that's possible, right?</b>

113
00:12:34,722 --> 00:12:36,651
<b>But you don't know until you've experienced it.</b>

114
00:12:38,352 --> 00:12:39,752
<b>My heart is sincere...</b>

115
00:12:40,592 --> 00:12:41,762
<b>to them both.</b>

116
00:12:44,762 --> 00:12:45,892
<b>So?</b>

117
00:12:47,161 --> 00:12:48,901
<b>Will you keep this going?</b>

118
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:00,311
<b>Yes.</b>

119
00:13:02,082 --> 00:13:03,311
<b>I got it resolved.</b>

120
00:13:10,082 --> 00:13:12,951
<b>I felt bad all day long about how I ran out this morning.</b>

121
00:13:14,462 --> 00:13:15,661
<b>When I thought about it,</b>

122
00:13:17,762 --> 00:13:19,561
<b>I realized you had a reason to think that.</b>

123
00:13:22,962 --> 00:13:24,132
<b>I've been inattentive, haven't I?</b>

124
00:13:27,872 --> 00:13:29,242
<b>I'll be much better...</b>

125
00:13:30,642 --> 00:13:32,212
<b>so you don't worry.</b>

126
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:38,212
<b>Is there nothing for me to worry about anymore?</b>

127
00:13:39,281 --> 00:13:40,482
<b>Definitely not.</b>

128
00:13:42,622 --> 00:13:45,791
<b>There's absolutely nothing to worry about.</b>

129
00:14:38,171 --> 00:14:42,612
<b>(A World of Married Couple)</b>

130
00:14:47,051 --> 00:14:49,651
<b>Yes. You're at an advantage.</b>

131
00:14:51,021 --> 00:14:53,321
<b>If he hasn't realized that you know...</b>

132
00:14:53,321 --> 00:14:55,321
<b>about his affair,</b>

133
00:14:55,321 --> 00:14:56,821
<b>that makes it better for our side.</b>

134
00:14:57,992 --> 00:14:59,392
<b>It's a good condition to be in as we make preparations.</b>

135
00:15:00,492 --> 00:15:03,762
<b>Did you secure evidence to prove his affair?</b>

136
00:15:06,401 --> 00:15:08,171
<b>No. Not yet.</b>

137
00:15:11,372 --> 00:15:15,142
<b>If you can find direct evidence to prove their sexual relation,</b>

138
00:15:15,142 --> 00:15:16,742
<b>the game would be over.</b>

139
00:15:17,712 --> 00:15:21,982
<b>For example, underwear, condom, or a picture on the bed.</b>

140
00:15:25,722 --> 00:15:28,921
<b>Don't go to a detective agency for help, though.</b>

141
00:15:29,321 --> 00:15:32,892
<b>If you got the evidence illegally, it won't have legal power.</b>

142
00:15:33,161 --> 00:15:35,102
<b>You could be violating Information Communications Network Act...</b>

143
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:36,332
<b>or Protection of Communications Secrets Act.</b>

144
00:15:36,332 --> 00:15:37,872
<b>They could counterclaim against you.</b>

145
00:15:40,502 --> 00:15:41,901
<b>- I'm sorry? - If you install...</b>

<b>security cameras or a GPS, you could get in trouble too.</b>

147

<b>You could get a criminal penalty for it.</b>

148
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:50,242
<b>Then...</b>

149
00:15:52,382 --> 00:15:53,551
<b>what do I have to do?</b>

150
00:15:54,781 --> 00:15:57,421
<b>It's okay to tail your husband in public places.</b>

151
00:15:58,151 --> 00:15:59,821
<b>Take many pictures too.</b>

152
00:16:00,421 --> 00:16:03,962
<b>If you can capture them entering a hotel, it would be perfect.</b>

153

<b>If you missed the chance to capture a picture,</b>

154
00:16:06,762 --> 00:16:08,031
<b>you could get a court order...</b>

<b>to ask the hotel to preserve the security footage as evidence.</b>

156
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,102
<b>Are you telling me...</b>

157
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,941
<b>to tail him myself?</b>

<b>She had to transfer here...</b>

<b>no matter what happens.</b>

355

<b>He said he would never leave his child behind...</b>

<b>He even got his hands on his son's insurance money.</b>

<b>How can I forgive him for the future of my child?</b>

370
00:45:16,792 --> 00:45:19,062
<b>I wanted my son to continue to have a dad.</b>

<b>He wouldn't have cheated on you if you allowed him.</b>

<b>My heart is broken for my son.</b>

388

<b>He lived all his life without a father.</b>

389

<b>Now you're separating him from his son too.</b>

<b>By the way, why do you always get your check-ups elsewhere?</b>

<b>You could get it done here too.</b>

<b>It looks like he's having trouble finding an investor.</b>

421

<b>I thought maybe you're worried along with him.</b>
