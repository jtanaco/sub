00:00:36,188 --> 00:00:37,587
<b>Ku Chan Seong.</b>

3
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:39,358
<b>When you see me off,</b>

4
00:00:41,858 --> 00:00:43,098
<b>don't feel lonely.</b>

5
00:00:44,898 --> 00:00:47,028
<b>Keep on taking good care of me,</b>

6
00:00:47,837 --> 00:00:50,498
<b>then try to see me off.</b>

7
00:00:51,868 --> 00:00:53,138
<b>That's what Ma Go wants.</b>

8
00:00:58,108 --> 00:00:59,248
<b>What are you doing?</b>

9
00:01:01,248 --> 00:01:02,348
<b>What?</b>

10
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:06,447
<b>Do you want me to go right now?</b>

11
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:16,027
<b>Don't be in a rush. Now isn't the right time.</b>

12
00:01:16,627 --> 00:01:19,898
<b>Do you really think I'll leave that easily?</b>

13
00:01:20,737 --> 00:01:24,507
<b>I'll make you feel miserable and get sick and tired of me.</b>

14
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:26,438
<b>When I leave,</b>

15
00:01:26,808 --> 00:01:29,938
<b>you'll probably put on a big smile and feel extremely relieved.</b>

16
00:02:26,228 --> 00:02:27,567
<b>Sir.</b>

17
00:02:27,798 --> 00:02:29,437
<b>You shouldn't be here.</b>

18
00:02:32,767 --> 00:02:33,907
<b>Sir.</b>

19
00:02:34,038 --> 00:02:36,436
<b>I know you can see me. You can hear me, right?</b>

20
00:02:36,437 --> 00:02:38,277
<b>My gosh, seriously!</b>

21
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:42,247
<b>Please don't spit on me.</b>

22
00:02:43,717 --> 00:02:44,847
<b>Stop it.</b>

23
00:02:45,217 --> 00:02:46,847
<b>How drunk is he?</b>

24
00:02:46,848 --> 00:02:49,486
<b>I don't think he's drunk. I think he's just crazy.</b>

25
00:02:49,487 --> 00:02:50,516
<b>Sir!</b>

26
00:02:50,517 --> 00:02:53,186
<b>- My goodness. - There are so many weird people.</b>

27
00:02:53,187 --> 00:02:56,198
<b>Calm down and follow me.</b>

28
00:02:57,128 --> 00:02:58,766
<b>- My gosh. - Poor thing.</b>

29
00:02:58,767 --> 00:03:01,398
<b>Hey, be quiet. Let's not provoke him.</b>

30
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,407
<b>I bought you beer like I promised.</b>

31
00:03:09,807 --> 00:03:11,108
<b>Thank you.</b>

32
00:03:11,848 --> 00:03:14,578
<b>Go to the hotel I told you about once you're done with the beer.</b>

33
00:03:15,418 --> 00:03:17,617
<b>You'll be able to find it if you follow the moon.</b>

34
00:03:18,418 --> 00:03:19,548
<b>Okay.</b>

35
00:03:22,457 --> 00:03:24,157
<b>- I can't believe this. - This is so cool.</b>

36
00:03:25,027 --> 00:03:27,488
<b>- My gosh, look at him. - Kim Joon Hyun?</b>

37
00:03:30,328 --> 00:03:31,698
<b>It's a sausage.</b>

38
00:03:33,698 --> 00:03:34,837
<b>Welcome.</b>

39
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:39,037
<b>That's 2 dollars and 80 cents.</b>

40
00:03:39,038 --> 00:03:40,977
<b>- It's really him. - He's really fat.</b>

41
00:03:40,978 --> 00:03:43,238
<b>I'm a fan of yours. Are you shooting something nearby?</b>

42
00:03:43,707 --> 00:03:45,948
<b>I really like it when you take those huge bites on your show.</b>

43
00:03:46,747 --> 00:03:48,377
<b>- I can't believe it's him. - Gosh, look.</b>

44
00:03:48,378 --> 00:03:49,516
<b>- He's coming. - He's coming.</b>

45
00:03:49,517 --> 00:03:51,486
<b>- Hello. - Hi.</b>

46
00:03:51,487 --> 00:03:54,388
<b>- I'm a huge fan. - Thank you.</b>

47
00:03:55,017 --> 00:03:56,958
<b>Can I please get an autograph?</b>

48
00:03:57,888 --> 00:04:00,557
<b>- Why are you going after him? - This is so cool.</b>

49
00:04:03,957 --> 00:04:06,668
<b>I can't believe he's even popular among ghosts.</b>

50
00:04:08,168 --> 00:04:10,467
<b>This place came out in "The Guys Who Died After Eating".</b>

51
00:04:10,598 --> 00:04:13,107
<b>Kim Joon Hyun can eat...</b>

52
00:04:13,108 --> 00:04:14,978
<b>5 sticky rice cakes in 1 just bite.</b>

53
00:04:15,608 --> 00:04:18,308
<b>He's really one of a kind.</b>

54
00:04:22,577 --> 00:04:24,287
<b>Ms. Jang likes him too.</b>

55
00:04:29,088 --> 00:04:31,256
<b>- I got the leg. - You need to put that in.</b>

56
00:04:31,257 --> 00:04:32,888
<b>- Yes. - My goodness.</b>

57
00:04:33,088 --> 00:04:35,157
<b>You're only going to have the webfoot octopus?</b>

58
00:04:35,158 --> 00:04:36,258
<b>Yes.</b>

59
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:39,868
<b>Ms. Fourth Choice came by today, and she's very clever.</b>

60
00:04:40,228 --> 00:04:42,768
<b>She volunteered to intern here.</b>

61
00:04:42,867 --> 00:04:44,097
<b>You should let her do that.</b>

62
00:04:45,038 --> 00:04:46,667
<b>Let her do what she wants.</b>

63
00:04:46,807 --> 00:04:50,438
<b>Then I'll put Hyun Joong in charge of training her.</b>

64
00:04:50,677 --> 00:04:53,078
<b>I'll make sure he teaches her well so she can take over right away...</b>

65
00:04:53,478 --> 00:04:54,676
<b>as soon as Mr. Ku quits.</b>

66
00:04:54,677 --> 00:04:56,917
<b>Did Chan Seong leave?</b>

67
00:04:57,148 --> 00:04:59,486
<b>Yes, he took the afternoon off today...</b>

68
00:04:59,487 --> 00:05:01,357
<b>and went home early.</b>

69
00:05:02,487 --> 00:05:03,688
<b>One bite!</b>

70
00:05:04,827 --> 00:05:08,398
<b>(Joon Hyun attempts to eat everything in one bite.)</b>

71
00:05:10,098 --> 00:05:12,227
<b>Do you want to eat that?</b>

72
00:05:14,268 --> 00:05:16,568
<b>Should I have the intern go buy some?</b>

73
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:18,808
<b>Forget it.</b>

74
00:05:19,838 --> 00:05:22,107
<b>I don't really crave anything today.</b>

75
00:05:34,617 --> 00:05:35,717
<b>Did you...</b>

76
00:05:36,288 --> 00:05:38,188
<b>find this?</b>

77
00:05:42,228 --> 00:05:43,328
<b>No.</b>

78
00:05:44,997 --> 00:05:46,868
<b>I thought I lost it.</b>

79
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:51,938
<b>Is finding it worth another leaf?</b>

80
00:05:55,877 --> 00:05:57,537
<b>If I want to show him this,</b>

81
00:05:58,377 --> 00:06:00,477
<b>I should start craving the webfoot octopus.</b>

82
00:06:12,728 --> 00:06:14,398
<b>Hello? Hey, Man Weol.</b>

83
00:06:15,257 --> 00:06:16,828
<b>Chan Seong? He's not home yet.</b>

84
00:06:17,427 --> 00:06:18,998
<b>He's not answering his phone.</b>

85
00:06:19,197 --> 00:06:23,167
<b>Once he comes home, tell him to wait since I'll be picking him up...</b>

86
00:06:23,367 --> 00:06:24,808
<b>in my brown car.</b>

87
00:06:24,838 --> 00:06:27,777
<b>Man Weol, Chan Seong might come home late tonight.</b>

88
00:06:27,908 --> 00:06:29,136
<b>What? Why?</b>

89
00:06:29,137 --> 00:06:30,977
<b>His girlfriend came by today.</b>

90
00:06:36,077 --> 00:06:37,176
<b>What did you just say?</b>

91
00:06:37,177 --> 00:06:39,487
<b>She's the girl he used to date back when he was in the States.</b>

92
00:06:39,747 --> 00:06:41,688
<b>She came to my house to meet Chan Seong.</b>

93
00:06:42,057 --> 00:06:43,487
<b>But they must be meeting outside.</b>

94
00:06:44,687 --> 00:06:45,828
<b>My gosh, you startled me.</b>

95
00:06:46,528 --> 00:06:47,828
<b>I didn't know you were here already.</b>

96
00:06:50,228 --> 00:06:53,297
<b>Chan Seong has a girlfriend?</b>

97
00:06:55,237 --> 00:06:57,268
<b>Who is she? Is she pretty?</b>

98
00:06:58,268 --> 00:06:59,938
<b>- Well... - Forget it. Stop talking.</b>

99
00:07:00,937 --> 00:07:03,578
<b>Why would you tell me about her? I never said I was curious.</b>

100
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:05,808
<b>I'm not interested.</b>

101
00:07:07,307 --> 00:07:09,547
<b>- See you. - But I haven't said anything yet.</b>

102
00:07:09,548 --> 00:07:12,148
<b>If you want to tell me so badly, go ahead. I'll hear you out.</b>

103
00:07:15,088 --> 00:07:16,318
<b>Is she pretty?</b>

104
00:07:19,658 --> 00:07:20,888
<b>I just asked if she's pretty.</b>

105
00:07:23,057 --> 00:07:25,797
<b>Yes, she's pretty. She's pretty.</b>

106
00:07:29,937 --> 00:07:31,037
<b>Sanchez.</b>

107
00:07:32,307 --> 00:07:35,977
<b>You really are slow-witted.</b>

108
00:07:37,947 --> 00:07:40,878
<b>You know nothing, do you?</b>

109
00:07:41,418 --> 00:07:43,047
<b>You're so stupid.</b>

110
00:07:44,648 --> 00:07:45,787
<b>Is she...</b>

111
00:07:46,947 --> 00:07:48,157
<b>that pretty?</b>

112
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:56,857
<b>Yes, she's really pretty. She's smart too.</b>

113
00:07:56,997 --> 00:07:58,527
<b>And she and Chan Seong make a great couple.</b>

114
00:07:58,528 --> 00:07:59,826
<b>I have a photo. Do you want to see it?</b>

115
00:07:59,827 --> 00:08:01,167
<b>I'll go find it. Wait here.</b>

116
00:08:05,408 --> 00:08:07,907
<b>If she really turns out to be pretty,</b>

117
00:08:09,137 --> 00:08:11,648
<b>you'll be dead, Sanchez.</b>

118
00:08:19,247 --> 00:08:20,618
<b>Man Weol, look.</b>

119
00:08:22,617 --> 00:08:24,688
<b>Man Weol? Did she leave?</b>

120
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:30,657
<b>I wonder if Chan Seong's late because he met Mi Ra.</b>

121
00:08:39,908 --> 00:08:43,677
<b>Their connection has lasted for a very long time.</b>

122
00:08:52,118 --> 00:08:54,557
<b>I hope he takes good care of her...</b>

123
00:08:56,158 --> 00:08:59,027
<b>so that she doesn't end up getting hurt again.</b>

124
00:09:12,168 --> 00:09:13,437
<b>- Unbelievable. - This is incredible.</b>

125
00:09:13,638 --> 00:09:15,238
<b>When is Kim Joon Hyun coming?</b>

126
00:09:17,408 --> 00:09:18,608
<b>My gosh, this is cool.</b>

127
00:09:19,607 --> 00:09:20,777
<b>Excuse me.</b>

128
00:09:21,918 --> 00:09:24,377
<b>Are they shooting "The Guys Who Died After Eating"?</b>

129
00:09:24,378 --> 00:09:27,317
<b>Yes, are you also here to get Kim Joon Hyun's autograph?</b>

130
00:09:28,187 --> 00:09:30,557
<b>A person I know is a fan of his.</b>

131
00:09:31,018 --> 00:09:33,086
<b>- His girlfriend is a fan of his. - My mom is a huge fan.</b>

132
00:09:33,087 --> 00:09:34,327
<b>My dad is a fan.</b>

133
00:09:37,557 --> 00:09:39,868
<b>My boss is a fan. She likes him a lot.</b>

134
00:09:40,327 --> 00:09:41,497
<b>Hey, you guys.</b>

135
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:43,137
<b>He's over there in his van. People are getting his autograph.</b>

136
00:09:43,138 --> 00:09:44,498
<b>- Let's go. - Come on.</b>

137
00:09:44,738 --> 00:09:46,108
<b>Sir, you should come.</b>

138
00:10:04,957 --> 00:10:06,657
<b>Maybe I should've gotten his autograph.</b>

139
00:10:07,628 --> 00:10:08,797
<b>She would've liked it.</b>

140
00:10:15,597 --> 00:10:16,768
<b>Ms. Jang?</b>

141
00:10:20,467 --> 00:10:23,177
<b>What are you doing here? Did you know that I was here?</b>

142
00:10:24,748 --> 00:10:25,848
<b>I heard.</b>

143
00:10:26,778 --> 00:10:27,877
<b>Did you meet?</b>

144
00:10:27,878 --> 00:10:30,118
<b>Well, yes. Kind of.</b>

145
00:10:30,918 --> 00:10:32,118
<b>You must've been so happy.</b>

146
00:10:33,518 --> 00:10:34,758
<b>So how was it?</b>

147
00:10:35,057 --> 00:10:36,586
<b>A lot leaner than I thought.</b>

148
00:10:36,587 --> 00:10:38,957
<b>With a small face and great skin.</b>

149
00:10:39,258 --> 00:10:40,627
<b>Why don't you go see for yourself?</b>

150
00:10:40,628 --> 00:10:42,696
<b>I'm sure he's still there. If you rush, you can see him.</b>

151
00:10:42,697 --> 00:10:44,598
<b>Forget it. Why would I?</b>

152
00:10:44,998 --> 00:10:47,167
<b>I came out to eat webfoot octopus.</b>

153
00:10:47,727 --> 00:10:48,838
<b>Webfoot octopus?</b>

154
00:10:49,967 --> 00:10:53,106
<b>You want to eat webfoot octopus dressed like that at this late hour?</b>

155
00:10:53,107 --> 00:10:56,677
<b>That's right. Webfoot octopus. That's the only reason I'm here.</b>

156
00:11:00,847 --> 00:11:02,248
<b>That's the earring I found.</b>

157
00:11:03,847 --> 00:11:04,947
<b>Oh, yes.</b>

158
00:11:05,288 --> 00:11:08,118
<b>I bought these to wear them when I'm going out to eat webfoot octopus.</b>

159
00:11:08,258 --> 00:11:10,657
<b>I'm headed to eat webfoot octopus since I found these earrings.</b>

160
00:11:10,717 --> 00:11:12,588
<b>You must come with me because you found it.</b>

161
00:11:13,057 --> 00:11:15,056
<b>You're just craving webfoot octopus.</b>

162
00:11:15,057 --> 00:11:17,696
<b>Stop coming up with these excuses that make no sense.</b>

163
00:11:17,697 --> 00:11:19,868
<b>Why? Are you sick and tired of me?</b>

164
00:11:19,927 --> 00:11:21,537
<b>You can't stand me anymore?</b>

165
00:11:26,368 --> 00:11:28,037
<b>If you want to eat webfoot octopus now,</b>

166
00:11:28,908 --> 00:11:30,407
<b>we should go to Noryangjin.</b>

167
00:11:30,677 --> 00:11:32,907
<b>Actually, no. The west coast is famous for webfoot octopus.</b>

168
00:11:33,307 --> 00:11:34,478
<b>Do you want to go to the sea?</b>

169
00:11:36,577 --> 00:11:38,648
<b>Well, okay.</b>

170
00:11:39,988 --> 00:11:41,988
<b>I guess we can see the sunrise on the way too.</b>

171
00:11:42,087 --> 00:11:44,057
<b>Although I'm not sure if we can see it on the west coast.</b>

172
00:11:45,158 --> 00:11:46,327
<b>Let's go.</b>

173
00:11:48,857 --> 00:11:50,027
<b>Sure.</b>

174
00:11:50,398 --> 00:11:52,768
<b>We'll take that tacky brown car, which you love.</b>

175
00:11:53,067 --> 00:11:55,138
<b>Let's go have some webfoot octopus, Chan Seong.</b>

176
00:11:56,868 --> 00:11:58,067
<b>Yes, let's go.</b>

177
00:11:58,337 --> 00:12:01,677
<b>By the way, are you sure you don't want to see Kim Joon Hyun?</b>

178
00:12:02,508 --> 00:12:03,608
<b>Kim Joon Hyun?</b>

179
00:12:04,508 --> 00:12:06,207
<b>How can I see him?</b>

180
00:12:06,248 --> 00:12:08,447
<b>Didn't you come here to see him?</b>

181
00:12:08,977 --> 00:12:10,348
<b>He's filming something over there.</b>

182
00:12:11,447 --> 00:12:13,248
<b>Darn it. Why didn't you tell me sooner?</b>

183
00:12:15,857 --> 00:12:17,057
<b>Oh, she can run.</b>

184
00:12:17,888 --> 00:12:19,287
<b>Ms. Jang!</b>

185
00:12:31,038 --> 00:12:34,067
<b>That's how much hangover soup he ate today.</b>

186
00:12:34,977 --> 00:12:37,577
<b>I heard he was chosen again today in that segment, One Bite.</b>

187
00:12:39,107 --> 00:12:41,307
<b>I can't believe I missed it.</b>

188
00:12:42,947 --> 00:12:45,748
<b>That's where he sat,</b>

189
00:12:45,988 --> 00:12:48,456
<b>so just be satisfied with having the hangover soup there.</b>

190
00:12:48,457 --> 00:12:49,657
<b>Eat before it gets cold.</b>

191
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:52,457
<b>Then why don't you show me how much you can eat in one bite?</b>

192
00:12:52,857 --> 00:12:54,926
<b>With some radish kimchi. Slurp it all in.</b>

193
00:12:54,927 --> 00:12:56,827
<b>Don't overestimate me, please.</b>

194
00:12:57,158 --> 00:12:59,167
<b>I'll enjoy this, in many bites.</b>

195
00:13:03,538 --> 00:13:05,667
<b>This restaurant will do very well now that Kim Joon Hyun...</b>

196
00:13:05,668 --> 00:13:06,968
<b>has dined here.</b>

197
00:13:09,207 --> 00:13:12,148
<b>This restaurant would've done fine even without Kim Joon Hyun.</b>

198
00:13:13,107 --> 00:13:14,348
<b>Because of her.</b>

199
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:19,317
<b>What about that baby?</b>

200
00:13:19,587 --> 00:13:21,557
<b>She brings a lot of luck to this place.</b>

201
00:13:21,557 --> 00:13:24,018
<b>She was born with a tremendous amount of luck...</b>

202
00:13:24,057 --> 00:13:26,157
<b>because of all the good karma she built up in her past lives.</b>

203
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:28,927
<b>Any family with such a child becomes successful in no time.</b>

204
00:13:29,128 --> 00:13:31,598
<b>You can be born with a lot of luck when you do many good deeds.</b>

205
00:13:32,998 --> 00:13:35,167
<b>Then in the opposite case...</b>

206
00:13:35,168 --> 00:13:38,067
<b>You're either born dirt poor or as a dog or a pig.</b>

207
00:13:38,138 --> 00:13:40,207
<b>Then if you're reincarnated...</b>

208
00:13:45,477 --> 00:13:47,907
<b>What? You just thought...</b>

209
00:13:48,447 --> 00:13:51,047
<b>I'd totally be reincarnated as a dog or a pig, didn't you?</b>

210
00:13:51,048 --> 00:13:53,287
<b>I mean, I'm not sure. But I am worried indeed...</b>

211
00:13:53,288 --> 00:13:54,547
<b>because it's highly likely.</b>

212
00:13:55,187 --> 00:13:57,387
<b>I've already paid for all my sins by running the hotel...</b>

213
00:13:57,388 --> 00:13:58,627
<b>for over a millennium.</b>

214
00:13:58,628 --> 00:14:01,426
<b>But it's not like you treated all the customers that well.</b>

215
00:14:01,427 --> 00:14:03,358
<b>How could I have treated them better?</b>

216
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,596
<b>You ignored some of them, saying they're nuisances.</b>

217
00:14:06,597 --> 00:14:08,667
<b>And you took money from the rich ones to buy booze...</b>

218
00:14:08,668 --> 00:14:09,898
<b>and cars for yourself.</b>

219
00:14:10,538 --> 00:14:11,836
<b>I'm really worried about you.</b>

220
00:14:11,837 --> 00:14:13,767
<b>It's none of your concern.</b>

221
00:14:13,768 --> 00:14:15,877
<b>It is. I should be concerned.</b>

222
00:14:15,878 --> 00:14:17,777
<b>I don't want you to be born as a dog or a pig.</b>

223
00:14:17,778 --> 00:14:19,947
<b>Gosh, it is none of your business!</b>

224
00:14:19,977 --> 00:14:21,848
<b>Imagine you being reincarnated as a pig.</b>

225
00:14:21,977 --> 00:14:23,748
<b>I don't want to meet you again as hangover soup.</b>

226
00:14:24,118 --> 00:14:25,388
<b>Be nice.</b>

227
00:14:26,447 --> 00:14:27,618
<b>I don't want this anymore.</b>

228
00:14:27,817 --> 00:14:29,388
<b>I lost my appetite because of you.</b>

229
00:14:32,057 --> 00:14:34,758
<b>I saw a ghost wandering around the area earlier.</b>

230
00:14:34,758 --> 00:14:36,257
<b>I told him to go to the hotel,</b>

231
00:14:36,258 --> 00:14:38,596
<b>but you should take him since you're here anyway.</b>

232
00:14:38,597 --> 00:14:39,697
<b>Be nice to him.</b>

233
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:42,968
<b>Chan Seong.</b>

234
00:14:44,868 --> 00:14:47,066
<b>Don't strike up conversations with ghosts you don't even know...</b>

235
00:14:47,067 --> 00:14:49,836
<b>or go up to them. You really shouldn't.</b>

236
00:14:49,837 --> 00:14:51,648
<b>They could be evil spirits.</b>

237
00:14:52,748 --> 00:14:53,907
<b>It's dangerous.</b>

238
00:14:58,118 --> 00:15:00,848
<b>Does wandering the living realm for a long time make them evil spirits?</b>

239
00:15:01,018 --> 00:15:03,388
<b>Any wandering spirit turns evil whenever it harms humans.</b>

240
00:15:03,587 --> 00:15:06,056
<b>And such a ghost can devour all other spirits,</b>

241
00:15:06,057 --> 00:15:07,957
<b>let alone humans.</b>

242
00:15:08,758 --> 00:15:10,457
<b>If it's caught by the Grim Reaper,</b>

243
00:15:10,998 --> 00:15:14,128
<b>it certainly won't be reincarnated as a lucky child...</b>

244
00:15:14,567 --> 00:15:16,738
<b>or even as an animal. Its soul will be perished on the spot.</b>

245
00:15:24,638 --> 00:15:28,848
<b>Why didn't you report to me about this room's guest leaving the hotel?</b>

246
00:15:29,077 --> 00:15:32,088
<b>It was due to a mistake of our general manager, who's human.</b>

247
00:15:32,118 --> 00:15:34,718
<b>What can we do? She left the hotel.</b>

248
00:15:37,758 --> 00:15:40,728
<b>Her soul is filled with hatred and resentment toward humans.</b>

249
00:15:41,087 --> 00:15:44,127
<b>If she causes any trouble in the outside world,</b>

250
00:15:44,128 --> 00:15:45,868
<b>I will hold the hotel accountable.</b>

251
00:15:51,707 --> 00:15:53,207
<b>What a headache.</b>

252
00:15:53,337 --> 00:15:55,677
<b>The Grim Reaper will manage to catch her and bring her back.</b>

253
00:15:55,837 --> 00:15:57,676
<b>If she causes trouble before she's caught...</b>

254
00:15:57,677 --> 00:15:59,508
<b>and turns into an evil spirit, we'll be doomed.</b>

255
00:16:00,408 --> 00:16:02,817
<b>She's a dangerous one, but I feel so bad for her.</b>

256
00:16:04,077 --> 00:16:07,417
<b>I hope she returns safely.</b>

257
00:16:14,957 --> 00:16:16,927
<b>(Hot new releases. Enjoy.)</b>

258
00:16:20,727 --> 00:16:22,537
<b>Shall I take a quick break?</b>

259
00:16:25,207 --> 00:16:27,737
<b>(Real hot stuff)</b>

260
00:16:27,738 --> 00:16:28,838
<b>What's this?</b>

261
00:16:39,687 --> 00:16:40,817
<b>She's taking her clothes off.</b>

262
00:16:43,918 --> 00:16:45,657
<b>Turn around. Let me see your face.</b>

263
00:16:59,538 --> 00:17:00,707
<b>Are you enjoying this?</b>

264
00:17:06,478 --> 00:17:07,608
<b>You like this?</b>

265
00:17:09,248 --> 00:17:10,517
<b>I'm hot, aren't I?</b>

266
00:18:18,548 --> 00:18:21,646
<b>(Are you going to pick me up again today?)</b>

267
00:18:21,647 --> 00:18:24,116
<b>(When will you be here?)</b>

268
00:18:24,117 --> 00:18:27,288
<b>(I can skip the afternoon classes.)</b>

269
00:18:28,397 --> 00:18:30,298
<b>How dare a ghost ignore my messages?</b>

270
00:18:32,597 --> 00:18:34,598
<b>I'm telling you. Yu Na is possessed.</b>

271
00:18:34,768 --> 00:18:36,338
<b>I got goosebumps all over that day.</b>

272
00:18:37,837 --> 00:18:39,166
<b>How about I try throwing this at her?</b>

273
00:18:39,167 --> 00:18:40,937
<b>- Good idea. - Yes, try it.</b>

274
00:18:40,938 --> 00:18:42,007
<b>Let's see if she can avoid it again.</b>

275
00:18:42,008 --> 00:18:43,808
<b>- All right, here I go. - Do it.</b>

276
00:18:46,847 --> 00:18:48,007
<b>Just a second.</b>

277
00:18:48,518 --> 00:18:50,416
<b>- Did you get a text? - No, it's not me.</b>

278
00:18:50,417 --> 00:18:52,048
<b>- It's not me either. - Same here.</b>

279
00:18:52,347 --> 00:18:53,517
<b>I didn't get anything either.</b>

280
00:18:53,788 --> 00:18:55,017
<b>- What is this, then? - What's going on?</b>

281
00:19:04,728 --> 00:19:06,427
<b>Other girls hate her so much.</b>

282
00:19:09,538 --> 00:19:10,667
<b>(I'm here. Behind you.)</b>

283
00:19:25,548 --> 00:19:28,348
<b>I got Ms. Jang's permission that you can come to the hotel.</b>

284
00:19:28,657 --> 00:19:30,888
<b>All right. Let's go there now, then.</b>

285
00:19:31,057 --> 00:19:33,187
<b>Now? But what about your classes?</b>

286
00:19:33,188 --> 00:19:36,128
<b>Didn't you see earlier? I'm struggling to fit in anyway.</b>

287
00:19:36,627 --> 00:19:38,098
<b>I have no problem quitting school.</b>

288
00:19:38,728 --> 00:19:42,497
<b>It's because of the friends that bully you, right?</b>

289
00:19:43,867 --> 00:19:46,368
<b>They're quite annoying, but it's fine.</b>

290
00:19:47,038 --> 00:19:50,237
<b>The real Kim Yu Na was a bad girl.</b>

291
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:53,308
<b>I'm actually enjoying seeing how much this girl...</b>

292
00:19:53,577 --> 00:19:55,048
<b>is hated by others.</b>

293
00:19:59,417 --> 00:20:02,217
<b>It's just that school is boring.</b>

294
00:20:02,387 --> 00:20:04,187
<b>Why do you think school is boring?</b>

295
00:20:04,557 --> 00:20:06,588
<b>I had so much fun back when I was in school.</b>

296
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:09,098
<b>I studied and played sports.</b>

297
00:20:09,528 --> 00:20:11,866
<b>I always came home so late from school...</b>

298
00:20:11,867 --> 00:20:13,598
<b>that our chief servant had to come to get me.</b>

299
00:20:15,438 --> 00:20:16,767
<b>"Chief servant"?</b>

300
00:20:17,867 --> 00:20:19,667
<b>Yes, he lived in our servants' quarters.</b>

301
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:22,437
<b>He was in a relationship with Un Nyeon, my sister's nanny.</b>

302
00:20:22,837 --> 00:20:25,038
<b>But he always fought with my dad's driver.</b>

303
00:20:25,748 --> 00:20:27,308
<b>They were in a love triangle.</b>

304
00:20:30,748 --> 00:20:34,487
<b>A chief servant, a nanny, and a driver too?</b>

305
00:20:34,988 --> 00:20:36,957
<b>I guess you were a son of a nobleman before you died.</b>

306
00:20:40,327 --> 00:20:42,157
<b>You were born with a golden spoon in your mouth.</b>

307
00:20:42,557 --> 00:20:44,657
<b>No, it was a silver spoon.</b>

308
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:47,167
<b>All of the spoons at my house were silver.</b>

309
00:20:47,827 --> 00:20:50,896
<b>You were born into a rich family with a silver spoon in your mouth,</b>

310
00:20:50,897 --> 00:20:53,138
<b>but you must have been disappointed to have lived a short life.</b>

311
00:20:58,607 --> 00:21:01,977
<b>Yes. I am so disappointed that I can't seem to let it go.</b>

312
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:05,217
<b>I can't even go to school even if I wanted to,</b>

313
00:21:05,218 --> 00:21:06,917
<b>so try to have a better time at school.</b>

314
00:21:12,988 --> 00:21:15,088
<b>Schools these days have gotten so much better.</b>

315
00:21:15,198 --> 00:21:16,898
<b>You guys wear nice school uniforms.</b>

316
00:21:17,897 --> 00:21:19,467
<b>And you have a great piano like this one.</b>

317
00:21:23,137 --> 00:21:25,608
<b>This piano is better than the one at my house.</b>

318
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:29,007
<b>Well,</b>

319
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:31,937
<b>it sounds like you learned how to play the piano too.</b>

320
00:21:35,317 --> 00:21:36,548
<b>Play it.</b>

321
00:21:38,647 --> 00:21:41,348
<b>I don't know how to play it, but I'll listen to it if you play.</b>

322
00:21:41,387 --> 00:21:42,917
<b>I've probably forgotten everything.</b>

323
00:21:43,157 --> 00:21:45,257
<b>Come on, rich guy. Play the piano.</b>

324
00:21:49,998 --> 00:21:51,628
<b>Whom are you talking to now?</b>

325
00:21:55,298 --> 00:21:58,167
<b>What are you talking about? I was playing the piano.</b>

326
00:21:59,768 --> 00:22:02,477
<b>Sure. Play it then.</b>

327
00:22:03,438 --> 00:22:05,777
<b>Go ahead, Yu Na. You're good at playing the piano.</b>

328
00:22:05,778 --> 00:22:07,148
<b>Play the piano.</b>

329
00:22:22,228 --> 00:22:24,528
<b>- See? - I was right.</b>

330
00:23:04,867 --> 00:23:06,667
<b>Hey, she can really play.</b>

331
00:23:20,488 --> 00:23:22,687
<b>You're pretty good, rich boy.</b>

332
00:23:22,688 --> 00:23:24,818
<b>See? You didn't forget it.</b>

333
00:23:27,728 --> 00:23:28,957
<b>I guess not.</b>

334
00:23:29,728 --> 00:23:31,328
<b>I can't seem to forget this.</b>

335
00:23:35,738 --> 00:23:37,167
<b>Hyun Joong!</b>

336
00:23:49,048 --> 00:23:50,416
<b>Will you ride the bicycle with me...</b>

337
00:23:50,417 --> 00:23:51,878
<b>even when you grow up later, Hyun Mi?</b>

338
00:23:52,288 --> 00:23:53,417
<b>Yes!</b>

339
00:23:54,288 --> 00:23:56,457
<b>You have to ride it with me. You made a promise to me.</b>

340
00:23:57,057 --> 00:23:58,788
<b>Young Master! Over here!</b>

341
00:23:59,057 --> 00:24:00,388
<b>Young Lady!</b>

342
00:24:49,607 --> 00:24:51,136
<b>Don't you think it's appropriate...</b>

343
00:24:51,137 --> 00:24:53,507
<b>for me to train Ms. Fourth Choice instead of Hyun Joong?</b>

344
00:24:53,508 --> 00:24:54,646
<b>I'm older than him.</b>

345
00:24:54,647 --> 00:24:57,717
<b>I'm sure she'll see more eye to eye with Hyun Joong who had been...</b>

346
00:24:57,718 --> 00:25:00,047
<b>educated in the modern times instead of a scholar...</b>

347
00:25:00,048 --> 00:25:01,816
<b>who talks about Confucius and Mencius.</b>

348
00:25:01,817 --> 00:25:04,616
<b>However, Hyun Joong is leaning toward Mr. Third Choice.</b>

349
00:25:04,617 --> 00:25:07,558
<b>Emotionally, he's bonding more with Mr. Ku.</b>

350
00:25:08,157 --> 00:25:10,628
<b>But he must accomplish his goal in this world too.</b>

351
00:25:10,728 --> 00:25:13,697
<b>He knows that the hotel might disappear,</b>

352
00:25:14,268 --> 00:25:16,297
<b>so I doubt that he will side with Mr. Ku.</b>

353
00:25:16,298 --> 00:25:20,068
<b>Right. He has to stay at the hotel until that day.</b>

354
00:25:21,008 --> 00:25:22,177
<b>I'm glad that...</b>

355
00:25:22,178 --> 00:25:24,737
<b>there aren't more changes after the leaves grew out.</b>

356
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,388
<b>What's going on?</b>

357
00:25:34,688 --> 00:25:36,616
<b>Ms. Jang must be angry.</b>

358
00:25:36,617 --> 00:25:38,656
<b>But she's with Mr. Ku now.</b>

359
00:25:38,657 --> 00:25:41,288
<b>I guess Mr. Third Choice must have gotten her riled up.</b>

360
00:25:41,357 --> 00:25:45,257
<b>I hope she burns with rage so the leaves fall off the branches.</b>

361
00:25:53,637 --> 00:25:55,638
<b>We must sell off the cars you don't need.</b>

362
00:25:56,738 --> 00:25:59,106
<b>I need every single car here.</b>

363
00:25:59,107 --> 00:26:03,616
<b>You said you didn't drive 7 of these 14 cars once last year.</b>

364
00:26:03,617 --> 00:26:05,917
<b>They are decorating my parking lot.</b>

365
00:26:06,448 --> 00:26:07,618
<b>Look.</b>

366
00:26:07,817 --> 00:26:10,916
<b>I've put these beautiful cars in the same color.</b>

367
00:26:10,917 --> 00:26:13,987
<b>And these cars are working hard to make my parking lot look pretty.</b>

368
00:26:13,988 --> 00:26:15,527
<b>This is a huge space.</b>

369
00:26:15,528 --> 00:26:18,098
<b>Imagine there are only three cars in this big space.</b>

370
00:26:18,127 --> 00:26:20,866
<b>That will look so empty.</b>

371
00:26:20,867 --> 00:26:23,737
<b>Exactly, my point. There's only one passenger.</b>

372
00:26:23,897 --> 00:26:26,038
<b>It makes no sense to have such a huge parking lot like this.</b>

373
00:26:27,208 --> 00:26:29,806
<b>Narrow down to three cars and park near the storage.</b>

374
00:26:29,807 --> 00:26:33,177
<b>And we can utilize this space for our customers.</b>

375
00:26:35,548 --> 00:26:37,148
<b>What's your problem?</b>

376
00:26:37,548 --> 00:26:39,618
<b>Why do you want me to sell off my cars?</b>

377
00:26:40,548 --> 00:26:42,858
<b>Because your finances are in the toilet.</b>

378
00:26:44,887 --> 00:26:46,927
<b>If you keep it up, you'll go bankrupt.</b>

379

<b>(General Manager Ku Chan Seong)</b>

380

<b>your next month's card bills with the balance we have now.</b>

<b>The painting of Mount Baekdu.</b>

383
00:27:03,337 --> 00:27:05,547
<b>No one is buying. It's not as wanted as I had expected.</b>

384
00:27:05,548 --> 00:27:07,146
<b>The gold bars from Kim Yu Na.</b>

385
00:27:07,147 --> 00:27:09,447
<b>You bought a car with that. The car.</b>

386
00:27:09,448 --> 00:27:11,848
<b>Right. What about the black card?</b>

387
00:27:12,817 --> 00:27:14,116
<b>I sent it back.</b>

388
00:27:14,117 --> 00:27:17,487
<b>You have to pay for the things you bought for the wedding.</b>

389
00:27:18,218 --> 00:27:20,987
<b>Have you gone mad? Why would you send that back?</b>

390
00:27:20,988 --> 00:27:23,628
<b>I cannot have you reincarnated as a dog or a pig.</b>

391
00:27:25,057 --> 00:27:28,528
<b>I won't help you extort money from people anymore.</b>

392
00:27:28,667 --> 00:27:31,568
<b>Live an honest life and save money.</b>

393

<b>Hey, Ku Chan Seong.</b>

394
00:27:36,978 --> 00:27:38,838
<b>You have nothing to lose.</b>

395
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:40,507
<b>So what if I get reincarnated as a dog or a pig?</b>

396
00:27:40,508 --> 00:27:42,878
<b>I'm fine even if I get reincarnated as a chicken.</b>

397

<b>Even if I meet you again as a bowl of chicken noodles,</b>

398
00:27:45,417 --> 00:27:48,957
<b>I can say, "Hello, I'm tastier when you eat me with fresh kimchi."</b>

399

<b>I'll say hello to you like this. I mean it.</b>

400

<b>If you don't sell off your cars and settle your bills,</b>

401

<b>you won't have a penny to buy chicken noodles next month.</b>

402
00:28:04,637 --> 00:28:06,507
<b>Will I be poor again?</b>

403
00:28:07,307 --> 00:28:09,278
<b>Oh, no. I hate being impoverished.</b>

404
00:28:10,807 --> 00:28:13,177
<b>Ku Chan Seong, you're lying, right?</b>

405
00:28:13,508 --> 00:28:15,477
<b>You're just trying to scare me, right?</b>

406
00:28:15,508 --> 00:28:18,947
<b>Ms. Jang wasn't always well-off.</b>

407
00:28:19,548 --> 00:28:23,088
<b>When I came to the hotel, things were rough.</b>

408
00:28:23,117 --> 00:28:25,457
<b>Back then, things were really tough.</b>

409
00:28:25,458 --> 00:28:27,957
<b>As things were hectic, we didn't have a human to be our manager.</b>

410
00:28:27,958 --> 00:28:31,257
<b>Ms. Jang went through a lot.</b>

411
00:28:40,637 --> 00:28:43,707
<b>I would love to have a bowl of makgeolli and radish water kimchi.</b>

412

<b>When the US Army truck passes by later,</b>

413
00:28:46,748 --> 00:28:48,548
<b>I'll try to get some food.</b>

<b>Thank you very much.</b>

<b>You're pretty good. I'll keep you on.</b>

<b>Thank you very much.</b>

419
00:29:19,847 --> 00:29:21,278
<b>I hate being poor.</b>

420
00:29:22,478 --> 00:29:25,217
<b>I will keep on eating caviar and drinking champagne.</b>

421
00:29:29,387 --> 00:29:30,816
<b>When she didn't have enough money,</b>

422
00:29:30,817 --> 00:29:33,088
<b>she managed to get by with kimchi and makgeolli.</b>

423
00:29:33,357 --> 00:29:35,427
<b>She can save up more money.</b>

424
00:29:36,928 --> 00:29:39,398
<b>Then, Ms. Jang will hate you.</b>

425
00:29:39,667 --> 00:29:41,298
<b>What if you get kicked out...</b>

426
00:29:42,097 --> 00:29:44,967
<b>You're doing a great job. You're truly loyal to her.</b>

427
00:29:45,397 --> 00:29:48,467
<b>I can take care of her current finances.</b>

428
00:29:48,468 --> 00:29:51,037
<b>But can the hotel be in a financial problem?</b>

429
00:29:51,038 --> 00:29:53,047
<b>When there was a war,</b>

430
00:29:53,048 --> 00:29:55,146
<b>there were more people who died than survived.</b>

431
00:29:55,147 --> 00:29:57,848
<b>And those people must have had unfinished business here.</b>

432
00:29:57,948 --> 00:30:00,646
<b>When that happens, the door to the afterlife opens wide,</b>

433
00:30:00,647 --> 00:30:03,088
<b>so not that many people stay at our hotel.</b>

434
00:30:03,887 --> 00:30:06,457
<b>We managed to get past a difficult era together.</b>

435
00:30:06,458 --> 00:30:09,628
<b>You did very well too, Mr. Kim.</b>

436
00:30:10,298 --> 00:30:12,828
<b>You were the one who had the most difficult time.</b>

437
00:30:13,268 --> 00:30:15,866
<b>Let's not be picky with our customers...</b>

438
00:30:15,867 --> 00:30:17,997
<b>and protect our hotel the best we can...</b>

<b>until the day we achieve our goals.</b>

440
00:30:20,107 --> 00:30:21,267
<b>Here.</b>

441
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:24,076
<b>1, 2, 3.</b>

442
00:30:24,077 --> 00:30:25,407
<b>We can do it.</b>

00:30:51,298 --> 00:30:52,467
<b>Your Majesty.</b>

444
00:30:53,438 --> 00:30:55,507
<b>We're well into the night.</b>

445
00:31:31,278 --> 00:31:32,477
<b>Who's there?</b>

446
00:31:33,278 --> 00:31:34,548
<b>Stand back...</b>

447
00:31:36,147 --> 00:31:37,247
<b>Cut!</b>

448
00:31:42,218 --> 00:31:46,028
<b>Mr. Yu, shouldn't the king sound more solemn?</b>

449
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:49,457
<b>- I'm sorry. - We'll take a short break.</b>

450
00:31:50,228 --> 00:31:53,267
<b>A king needs to sound formidable, so work on it.</b>

451
00:31:53,728 --> 00:31:55,997
<b>Yes, ma'am. Formidable, right.</b>

452
00:31:56,798 --> 00:31:57,967
<b>My gosh!</b>

453
00:32:06,948 --> 00:32:09,848
<b>How dare you. How dare...</b>

454

<b>Who's there?</b>

00:32:37,307 --> 00:32:38,306
<b>Who are you?</b>

459
00:32:38,307 --> 00:32:40,407
<b>Such insolence! Make way!</b>

460
00:32:41,508 --> 00:32:43,447
<b>Yu Oh!</b>

461
00:32:44,518 --> 00:32:45,848
<b>- My gosh. - Mr. Yu?</b>

462
00:32:46,988 --> 00:32:49,457
<b>- Yu Oh! - Wake up.</b>

463
00:32:49,458 --> 00:32:51,416
<b>- Please wake up. - Can You hear us?</b>

464
00:32:51,417 --> 00:32:52,656
<b>- Do something. - Wake up!</b>

465
00:32:52,657 --> 00:32:54,687
<b>- What's wrong with him? - Goodness.</b>

466
00:32:54,688 --> 00:32:56,497
<b>Yu Oh, wake up.</b>

467
00:32:56,498 --> 00:33:00,898
<b>Why isn't there anyone who can hear me?</b>

468
00:33:01,597 --> 00:33:04,138
<b>Yu Oh, come back to us.</b>

469
00:33:29,087 --> 00:33:30,227
<b>Welcome!</b>

470
00:33:38,738 --> 00:33:39,838
<b>Your Majesty?</b>

471
00:33:42,307 --> 00:33:43,538
<b>How dare you!</b>

472
00:33:52,647 --> 00:33:55,148
<b>Ms. Choi, something is going on?</b>

473
00:33:55,347 --> 00:33:59,358
<b>A VVIP has come to our hotel.</b>

474
00:34:04,428 --> 00:34:05,997
<b>"A VVIP"?</b>

475
00:34:07,627 --> 00:34:09,227
<b>A king has made his way here.</b>

476
00:34:09,298 --> 00:34:11,797
<b>I was never able to see one while I lived,</b>

477
00:34:11,798 --> 00:34:13,238
<b>but now I get the chance.</b>

478
00:34:13,337 --> 00:34:16,178
<b>A big score has entered the hotel. Gather everyone.</b>

479
00:34:16,477 --> 00:34:19,036
<b>We'll provide the VVIP with the best service...</b>

480
00:34:19,037 --> 00:34:21,077
<b>and have him thoroughly satisfied.</b>

481
00:34:34,528 --> 00:34:38,028
<b>Your Majesty!</b>

482
00:34:42,428 --> 00:34:45,068
<b>It's an honor to accommodate someone of your status.</b>

483
00:34:45,397 --> 00:34:48,068
<b>I am the owner of this hotel,</b>

484
00:34:48,107 --> 00:34:51,577
<b>Jang Man Weol.</b>

485
00:34:56,218 --> 00:34:57,378
<b>A king?</b>

486
00:34:58,877 --> 00:35:01,017
<b>Tae, Jeong, Tae, Se, Mun, Dan, Se.</b>

487
00:35:02,448 --> 00:35:03,717
<b>Which King could he be?</b>

488
00:35:03,718 --> 00:35:07,687
<b>You must be exhausted as is. Allow me to escort you to your room.</b>

489
00:35:24,711 --> 00:35:29,711


490
00:35:46,968 --> 00:35:50,238
<b>Your Majesty, we have brought you your meal.</b>

491
00:36:06,147 --> 00:36:07,347
<b>This...</b>

492
00:36:07,948 --> 00:36:09,218
<b>It's a portable toilet.</b>

493
00:36:09,587 --> 00:36:11,316
<b>I know he doesn't need it,</b>

494
00:36:11,317 --> 00:36:13,327
<b>but I thought it'll bring him some comfort.</b>

495
00:36:14,587 --> 00:36:16,297
<b>That is very considerate of you.</b>

496
00:36:16,298 --> 00:36:19,497
<b>Now that I've served the king, I wouldn't even mind dying...</b>

497
00:36:20,127 --> 00:36:23,137
<b>Well, I'm already dead, but that's just how delighted I am.</b>

498
00:36:27,738 --> 00:36:28,908
<b>Your Majesty...</b>

499
00:36:30,937 --> 00:36:33,146
<b>I don't want our energy disrupted here,</b>

500
00:36:33,147 --> 00:36:34,508
<b>so don't allow any more new guests.</b>

501
00:36:34,607 --> 00:36:36,648
<b>They can come back after he leaves.</b>

502
00:36:36,948 --> 00:36:38,048
<b>Yes, ma'am.</b>

503
00:36:43,317 --> 00:36:44,488
<b>Ms. Jang.</b>

504
00:36:45,388 --> 00:36:47,727
<b>You shouldn't discriminate against guests like this.</b>

505
00:36:47,758 --> 00:36:49,187
<b>Well, I can.</b>

506
00:36:49,798 --> 00:36:52,358
<b>I'm busy here, so go home if you're only going to nag me.</b>

507
00:36:53,098 --> 00:36:55,727
<b>He's dressed like a king of Joseon. Which one is he?</b>

508
00:36:56,368 --> 00:36:57,798
<b>Some were tyrants, you know.</b>

509
00:36:59,868 --> 00:37:02,537
<b>Nonsense! He didn't seem evil.</b>

510
00:37:03,078 --> 00:37:06,307
<b>Then did he seem generous and wise?</b>

511
00:37:07,747 --> 00:37:08,878
<b>Well...</b>

512
00:37:09,747 --> 00:37:12,948
<b>Why are you complaining again? What's wrong this time?</b>

513
00:37:13,417 --> 00:37:14,787
<b>You must be clueless.</b>

514
00:37:15,247 --> 00:37:18,517
<b>It's understandable considering it's your first time serving one.</b>

515
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:23,327
<b>Have you served one while working in a hotel then?</b>

516
00:37:23,857 --> 00:37:25,028
<b>Of course.</b>

517
00:37:25,497 --> 00:37:28,198
<b>I've served a few members of Dubai's royal family.</b>

518
00:37:29,798 --> 00:37:30,896
<b>So?</b>

519
00:37:30,897 --> 00:37:33,137
<b>Are you seriously bragging about it?</b>

520
00:37:33,437 --> 00:37:35,167
<b>- That's not it... - Enough.</b>

521
00:37:35,767 --> 00:37:37,577
<b>Then you don't know jack.</b>

522
00:37:37,578 --> 00:37:38,707
<b>Dismissed!</b>

523
00:37:40,377 --> 00:37:43,378
<b>Chan Seong, the painting of Mount Baekdu...</b>

524
00:37:44,948 --> 00:37:46,287
<b>Try selling it at half price.</b>

525
00:37:46,917 --> 00:37:48,588
<b>Don't come to work until you do.</b>

526
00:37:54,187 --> 00:37:56,557
<b>They're just too excited because of the king.</b>

527
00:37:58,198 --> 00:37:59,427
<b>His Majesty's presence...</b>

528
00:37:59,428 --> 00:38:01,467
<b>will make the flowers bloom in the garden.</b>

529
00:38:01,468 --> 00:38:03,597
<b>Making sure he rests well before leaving for the afterlife...</b>

530
00:38:03,598 --> 00:38:04,867
<b>is most important.</b>

531
00:38:04,968 --> 00:38:06,307
<b>Ma'am!</b>

532
00:38:06,738 --> 00:38:08,838
<b>I had him sign the hotel register.</b>

533
00:38:09,778 --> 00:38:10,936
<b>(Hotel Register)</b>

534
00:38:10,937 --> 00:38:14,077
<b>So his name is Lee Hyun.</b>

535
00:38:15,508 --> 00:38:16,678
<b>"Lee Hyun"?</b>

536
00:38:17,877 --> 00:38:19,617
<b>Which King had Lee Hyun for a name?</b>

537
00:38:20,087 --> 00:38:21,687
<b>It sounds somewhat familiar.</b>

538
00:38:22,417 --> 00:38:23,517
<b>Let me see.</b>

539
00:38:23,888 --> 00:38:26,927
<b>Han Seok Kyu played Lee Do, Lee Seo Jin played Lee San,</b>

540
00:38:26,928 --> 00:38:29,797
<b>- and Kim Soo Hyun played Lee Hwon. - That character doesn't count.</b>

541
00:38:29,798 --> 00:38:33,167
<b>It was a character made-up for that particular series.</b>

542
00:38:33,798 --> 00:38:36,867
<b>Right, a crossover period drama. I'm aware of that.</b>

543
00:38:38,138 --> 00:38:40,068
<b>So who's Lee Hyun? Did you look it up?</b>

544
00:38:40,508 --> 00:38:41,738
<b>I found him.</b>

545
00:38:41,908 --> 00:38:45,037
<b>Right? I knew he existed.</b>

546
00:38:45,738 --> 00:38:48,247
<b>He's a character from a TV series.</b>

547
00:38:52,048 --> 00:38:53,148
<b>Let me see that.</b>

548
00:38:54,548 --> 00:38:56,218
<b>"The Crowned Queen"?</b>

549
00:38:58,857 --> 00:39:00,327
<b>Oh, that's right.</b>

550
00:39:00,328 --> 00:39:02,758
<b>The king from this series goes by the name Lee Hyun.</b>

551
00:39:03,227 --> 00:39:05,128
<b>He is a king!</b>

552
00:39:05,727 --> 00:39:10,167
<b>Lee Hyun is just like Lee Hwon from earlier.</b>

553
00:39:10,368 --> 00:39:13,968
<b>He's a TV character from a crossover period drama.</b>

554
00:39:15,808 --> 00:39:16,977
<b>What?</b>

555
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:24,610
<b>"The Crowned Queen"...</b>

556
00:39:24,671 --> 00:39:26,380
<b>is about a queen...</b>

557
00:39:26,381 --> 00:39:28,641
<b>who hires a gisaeng that looks similar...</b>

558
00:39:28,841 --> 00:39:31,811
<b>to take her place in the palace in order to stay safe.</b>

559
00:39:32,651 --> 00:39:35,250
<b>Lee Hyun is the name of the king...</b>

560
00:39:35,251 --> 00:39:36,590
<b>who is also the husband.</b>

561
00:39:37,751 --> 00:39:39,420
<b>Then who is that king that just came in?</b>

562
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:41,121
<b>Why does he say he is Lee Hyun?</b>

563
00:39:41,461 --> 00:39:43,360
<b>The guest who came to the hotel...</b>

564
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:45,791
<b>is the actor Bang Tae Woo.</b>

565
00:39:47,901 --> 00:39:49,601
<b>The actor Bang Tae Woo...</b>

566
00:39:49,731 --> 00:39:52,469
<b>mostly played minor roles and supporting roles.</b>

567
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:56,469
<b>The first leading role he had was the role of King Lee Hyun.</b>

568
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:59,440
<b>However, sadly, before filming even started,</b>

569
00:39:59,441 --> 00:40:01,840
<b>he had a cardiac arrest while working out.</b>

570
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,981
<b>He died suddenly.</b>

571
00:40:04,751 --> 00:40:07,950
<b>You mean he is not a king.</b>

572
00:40:08,521 --> 00:40:11,990
<b>He was putting his soul into acting to take the role of a king.</b>

573
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,420
<b>He was an actor.</b>

574
00:40:13,421 --> 00:40:15,090
<b>The way he talked and walked...</b>

575
00:40:15,091 --> 00:40:17,791
<b>was perfectly like a king.</b>

576
00:40:17,831 --> 00:40:20,360
<b>He died while he was so immersed in the role.</b>

577
00:40:20,361 --> 00:40:24,431
<b>I believe he thinks he is a real king.</b>

578
00:40:31,271 --> 00:40:33,840
<b>This is so embarrassing.</b>

579
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:37,081
<b>After we serve him breakfast, send him off in the bus...</b>

580
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:38,751
<b>first thing in the morning.</b>

581
00:40:59,231 --> 00:41:00,601
<b>I heard he was not a king.</b>

582
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:03,409
<b>You should have recognized it right away...</b>

583
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:05,041
<b>when I voiced my suspicions.</b>

584
00:41:05,041 --> 00:41:06,141
<b>Good for you.</b>

585
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,679
<b>I didn't send back the guests...</b>

586
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,240
<b>who had come, just in case.</b>

587
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,380
<b>I acted in a wise way.</b>

588
00:41:11,381 --> 00:41:12,981
<b>I said, good for you!</b>

589
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:16,420
<b>When I saw him, there was a small scar on his face.</b>

590
00:41:16,421 --> 00:41:17,920
<b>You didn't see it, right?</b>

591
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,960
<b>It is impossible for a king to have a scar on his face...</b>

592
00:41:20,961 --> 00:41:22,661
<b>in Joseon Dynasty.</b>

593
00:41:22,861 --> 00:41:24,090
<b>You know Queen Yoon who got kicked out, right?</b>

594
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:26,231
<b>You should know since you love dramas.</b>

595
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:28,429
<b>I know her. She was Prince Gwanghae's mom.</b>

596
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:29,601
<b>It was Prince Yeonsan.</b>

597
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:33,029
<b>You should have checked which king he was.</b>

598
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:34,840
<b>I thought you felt the energy of ghosts.</b>

599
00:41:34,841 --> 00:41:36,400
<b>But you were fooled by an actor.</b>

600
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:40,880
<b>It looked so real.</b>

601
00:41:41,341 --> 00:41:43,311
<b>What do you know about acting that is filled with spirit?</b>

602
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:45,580
<b>To put it bluntly, he must have...</b>

603
00:41:45,581 --> 00:41:47,080
<b>wanted that role so much.</b>

604
00:41:47,081 --> 00:41:49,121
<b>That's why he thinks he is a king even after he is dead.</b>

605
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,750
<b>Why do you look down on a ghost giving such a performance?</b>

606
00:41:51,751 --> 00:41:53,791
<b>How dare you look down on that? Who do you think you are?</b>

607
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:56,420
<b>I am...</b>

608
00:41:56,561 --> 00:41:58,560
<b>just saying I recognized that he wasn't a king.</b>

609
00:41:58,561 --> 00:42:02,431
<b>If a guest says he is a king, a hotelier should treat him as such.</b>

610
00:42:02,501 --> 00:42:04,400
<b>Whether he is Mansour or a king from a drama.</b>

611
00:42:04,501 --> 00:42:06,501
<b>The guests in our hotel are all kings!</b>

612
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:14,110
<b>When did she ever treat our guests like kings?</b>

613
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,860
<b>(Yu Oh is such a terrible actor. I'm sick of Yu's terrible acting.)</b>

614
00:42:26,861 --> 00:42:29,690
<b>A popular star who can't act has replaced the dead actor.</b>

615
00:42:29,691 --> 00:42:30,961
<b>He is being criticized so much.</b>

616
00:42:34,561 --> 00:42:35,860
<b>If it was him,</b>

617
00:42:36,731 --> 00:42:38,970
<b>he would have shown great acting.</b>

618
00:42:46,881 --> 00:42:48,681
<b>If an actor performs as if he's possessed...</b>

619
00:42:49,981 --> 00:42:51,081
<b>Would that be possible?</b>

620
00:42:57,751 --> 00:43:00,391
<b>I repented a lot after talking to you.</b>

621
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:02,360
<b>When you said guests were our kings,</b>

622
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:04,661
<b>I was also moved.</b>

623
00:43:06,390 --> 00:43:08,199
<b>If you know that, you should work better in the future.</b>

624
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,601
<b>So I have been thinking.</b>

625
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:13,029
<b>If the guest wants to act,</b>

626
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:14,700
<b>we have to help him realize his wishes.</b>

627
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:19,211
<b>Us hoteliers...</b>

628
00:43:19,271 --> 00:43:21,780
<b>will help our guests to become kings if that is what they want.</b>

629
00:43:21,881 --> 00:43:23,141
<b>Whether that is Mansour...</b>

630
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:25,610
<b>of a king from a drama.</b>

631
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:38,061
<b>One more time.</b>

632
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:40,200
<b>We need to upload it online.</b>

633
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:42,561
<b>Show how tasty it is.</b>

634
00:43:43,001 --> 00:43:44,470
<b>Okay. 1, 2, 3.</b>

635
00:43:47,401 --> 00:43:49,569
<b>Sanchez's shop was asked by Yu Oh's fan club...</b>

636
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:51,311
<b>to send a pizza truck to the filming set.</b>

637
00:43:51,941 --> 00:43:54,380
<b>So we were able to get into the set easily.</b>

638
00:43:56,441 --> 00:43:58,980
<b>What's the use of giving a possessed performance.</b>

639
00:43:58,981 --> 00:44:00,820
<b>It's not like that his face will be on screen.</b>

640
00:44:00,981 --> 00:44:03,521
<b>I should have acted as if I was possessed after eating this...</b>

641
00:44:03,591 --> 00:44:05,751
<b>- I'm sorry. - It's okay. It's delicious.</b>

642
00:44:05,921 --> 00:44:08,119
<b>Ask him to look around the set...</b>

643
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:10,431
<b>then offer some pizza to the staff, and leave.</b>

644
00:44:11,231 --> 00:44:12,331
<b>Ms. Jang.</b>

645
00:44:12,961 --> 00:44:14,601
<b>It's what the guest wants.</b>

646
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,331
<b>He is looking so forward to it.</b>

647
00:44:16,401 --> 00:44:18,900
<b>- Hoteliers should... - Forget it.</b>

648
00:44:18,901 --> 00:44:20,030
<b>I get it.</b>

649
00:44:21,870 --> 00:44:23,170
<b>Look after the pizza truck.</b>

650
00:44:23,171 --> 00:44:24,771
<b>I'll go get the shooting schedule.</b>

<b>Excuse me. Food Truck lady?</b>

<b>Please take five pizzas to our costumes staff.</b>

<b>Stop there.</b>

656

<b>Hey.</b>

657
00:44:45,291 --> 00:44:47,161
<b>This is not a delivery truck.</b>

658

<b>If they want to eat, they should come and get it themselves.</b>

659

<b>Okay.</b>

660
00:44:57,311 --> 00:44:58,470
<b>How impertinent.</b>

<b>(Enjoy the pizza and act as if you're possessed.)</b>

662

<b>Sir, it's me Yu Oh.</b>

<b>Did you talk to the writer about me not filming those scenes?</b>

665

<b>I am skipping the last two weeks, right?</b>

<b>Even if his face is not seen,</b>

<b>What is it, my queen?</b>

<b>You are the king of all the people of this land.</b>

<b>Is that why you wanted to leave my side?</b>

712

<b>If I stay with you,</b>

<b>If you go to the seas,</b>

<b>How dare you?</b>

740
00:51:22,111 --> 00:51:25,910
<b>Our guest agreed to help him act until the drama ends?</b>

741
00:51:29,781 --> 00:51:31,120
<b>Let's see.</b>

742
00:51:32,281 --> 00:51:34,421
<b>Yes, apparently so.</b>

743
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:37,921
<b>Why? I thought she wanted to send him away.</b>

744
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:42,289
<b>His face might not appear on TV even if he acts,</b>

745
00:51:42,290 --> 00:51:43,890
<b>but she'll gain something else.</b>

746
00:51:46,201 --> 00:51:48,830
<b>My gosh, this is unbelievable.</b>

747
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:51,599
<b>After I went over my lines with you,</b>

748
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:53,370
<b>I suddenly acted like I was possessed.</b>

749
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:55,071
<b>You know what I mean, right?</b>

750
00:51:55,111 --> 00:51:58,680
<b>I felt like I was possessed by someone else when I acted.</b>

751
00:51:59,181 --> 00:52:01,610
<b>By any chance, are you an acting teacher?</b>

752
00:52:01,611 --> 00:52:02,881
<b>Do you want...</b>

753
00:52:03,650 --> 00:52:04,950
<b>to keep this up?</b>

754
00:52:04,951 --> 00:52:07,490
<b>Of course. Please do me a favor...</b>

755
00:52:07,491 --> 00:52:09,321
<b>and continue to help me out.</b>

756
00:52:09,491 --> 00:52:10,591
<b>Then...</b>

757
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:13,620
<b>let's start negotiating your pay.</b>

758
00:52:14,261 --> 00:52:15,531
<b>My pay?</b>

759
00:52:15,730 --> 00:52:18,430
<b>Oh, sure. I guess you already know.</b>

760
00:52:18,431 --> 00:52:20,030
<b>You can take everything.</b>

761
00:52:20,031 --> 00:52:22,099
<b>How much do you get paid for each episode?</b>

762
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:23,269
<b>I get paid 120,000 dollars per episode.</b>

763
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:24,899
<b>I was supposed to be absent for two weeks, but not anymore.</b>

764
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:27,310
<b>So 4 times 120,000 dollars is 480,000 dollars in total.</b>

765
00:52:27,741 --> 00:52:29,640
<b>I guess that will be enough to rent a house.</b>

766
00:52:29,770 --> 00:52:32,180
<b>Go ahead and take everything. It's fine with me.</b>

767
00:52:33,681 --> 00:52:36,209
<b>Our guest is actually working for that money,</b>

768
00:52:36,210 --> 00:52:38,151
<b>and he also agreed with this.</b>

769
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:39,720
<b>So I have no objections.</b>

770
00:52:39,821 --> 00:52:44,290
<b>Hey, I didn't know actors got paid that much money.</b>

771
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:47,590
<b>Chan Seong, how about you start a career in acting?</b>

772
00:52:47,591 --> 00:52:50,531
<b>I don't know how to act. I'm a horrible actor.</b>

773
00:52:51,131 --> 00:52:54,700
<b>I guess you're right. I can tell that you'll be bad at it.</b>

774
00:52:55,201 --> 00:52:56,700
<b>So tell me.</b>

775
00:52:56,870 --> 00:53:00,200
<b>You told me that I don't even have enough money to buy myself...</b>

776
00:53:00,201 --> 00:53:03,540
<b>a bowl of chicken noodles. But that was a lie, wasn't it?</b>

777
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:05,881
<b>It's true that your loan is overdue.</b>

778
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:07,850
<b>But I did lie about the chicken noodles.</b>

779
00:53:08,281 --> 00:53:10,950
<b>You have enough money for webfoot octopus.</b>

780
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:12,680
<b>Oh, right. Webfoot octopus.</b>

781
00:53:12,681 --> 00:53:14,890
<b>I couldn't eat that because of you.</b>

782
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:18,390
<b>Yes, you're right. It's all my fault.</b>

783
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:22,660
<b>I'll forgive you since you know you're at fault.</b>

784
00:53:23,661 --> 00:53:25,231
<b>Then let's go to the west coast.</b>

785
00:53:25,531 --> 00:53:27,869
<b>We might get lucky and see the sunrise.</b>

786
00:53:27,870 --> 00:53:29,131
<b>And we can also eat webfoot octopus.</b>

787
00:53:29,270 --> 00:53:30,430
<b>What's going on?</b>

788
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:32,301
<b>Why are you being so nice?</b>

789
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:36,869
<b>Are you suddenly being nice to me...</b>

790
00:53:36,870 --> 00:53:38,881
<b>because I told you I'm going to be your last guest?</b>

791
00:53:39,681 --> 00:53:41,749
<b>"We'll give you everything you want."</b>

792
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:44,881
<b>Gosh, what an incredible hotelier.</b>

793
00:53:46,181 --> 00:53:47,890
<b>I'm not that incredible.</b>

794
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:52,361
<b>Hoteliers aren't supposed to have personal feelings for their guests.</b>

795
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:55,160
<b>What?</b>

796
00:53:58,361 --> 00:54:01,071
<b>What kind of personal feelings do you have for me?</b>

797
00:54:01,330 --> 00:54:02,631
<b>The leaf.</b>

798
00:54:04,641 --> 00:54:06,301
<b>You showed me that I got two leaves.</b>

799
00:54:07,270 --> 00:54:08,711
<b>How do you expect me to ignore that?</b>

800
00:54:13,741 --> 00:54:16,651
<b>Let's not go today. I had too much champagne.</b>

801
00:54:17,451 --> 00:54:20,651
<b>We can have the webfoot octopus tomorrow.</b>

802
00:54:22,290 --> 00:54:24,220
<b>I need to go to the filming set tomorrow.</b>

803
00:54:24,221 --> 00:54:25,821
<b>You don't need to come.</b>

804
00:54:25,991 --> 00:54:27,790
<b>I hired an intern for you.</b>

805
00:54:30,861 --> 00:54:32,801
<b>("The Crowned Queen")</b>

806
00:54:39,071 --> 00:54:40,599
<b>You're the intern?</b>

807
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:41,711
<b>Yes.</b>

808
00:54:41,810 --> 00:54:44,481
<b>Feel free to quit whenever you wish.</b>

809
00:54:44,681 --> 00:54:46,111
<b>I'll take your place.</b>

810
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:48,750
<b>You should be in school.</b>

811
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:51,151
<b>I'm planning to stay in school.</b>

812
00:54:53,551 --> 00:54:57,091
<b>I'm doing it for someone who used to love going to school.</b>

813
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,130
<b>School's over today, so I can go with you, right?</b>

814
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:02,830
<b>I can't find the hotel on my own during the daytime.</b>

815
00:55:02,830 --> 00:55:05,930
<b>Let's go next time. I have an appointment here.</b>

816
00:55:06,201 --> 00:55:07,470
<b>Who are you meeting?</b>

817
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,030
<b>A ghost?</b>

818
00:55:09,031 --> 00:55:10,941
<b>No, it's a human being. I'm meeting a friend.</b>

819
00:55:11,971 --> 00:55:14,470
<b>I'm not interested in humans. I'll see you.</b>

820
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:19,310
<b>Gosh, this looks nice.</b>

821
00:55:19,641 --> 00:55:20,849
<b>I like it.</b>

822
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:22,711
<b>- Thank you for the food. - No problem.</b>

823
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:25,220
<b>I heard you're Man Weol's relative. You should come often.</b>

824
00:55:25,221 --> 00:55:26,321
<b>Okay.</b>

825
00:55:27,281 --> 00:55:28,950
<b>Hey, Mi Ra.</b>

826
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,591
<b>Chan Seong's waiting for you inside. Go ahead.</b>

827
00:55:53,411 --> 00:55:56,211
<b>I thought he was meeting a friend. But I guess he meant his girlfriend.</b>

828
00:56:01,891 --> 00:56:03,220
<b>It's been a while.</b>

829
00:56:06,091 --> 00:56:07,261
<b>Yes, it has.</b>

830
00:56:15,631 --> 00:56:18,700
<b>Where are you going, Ms. Jang? You look like you're in a good mood.</b>

831
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:21,140
<b>Yes, I'm going to the beach.</b>

832
00:56:21,141 --> 00:56:23,441
<b>The beach? There's a beach in our hotel.</b>

833
00:56:23,741 --> 00:56:25,511
<b>You can't compare that to a real beach.</b>

834
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:27,309
<b>How is it different?</b>

835
00:56:27,310 --> 00:56:28,580
<b>Our beach is...</b>

836
00:56:31,821 --> 00:56:32,981
<b>Webfoot octopus.</b>

837
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:35,119
<b>There's no webfoot octopus here.</b>

838
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:36,790
<b>I'm on my way to eat that.</b>

839
00:56:38,391 --> 00:56:40,060
<b>Should I ask Yu Na to buy you some?</b>

840
00:56:40,091 --> 00:56:43,160
<b>No, I want to eat it there.</b>

841
00:56:43,161 --> 00:56:46,100
<b>Gosh, it would've been nice if Mr. Ku went with you.</b>

842
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:47,361
<b>Should I call him?</b>

843
00:56:47,870 --> 00:56:49,531
<b>There's no need. He'll be here.</b>

844
00:56:49,801 --> 00:56:51,800
<b>I guess you're right. I feel a little sorry...</b>

845
00:56:51,801 --> 00:56:53,600
<b>about rushing him since he's with his girlfriend.</b>

846
00:56:54,571 --> 00:56:57,310
<b>Yu Na apparently saw her. I heard she's really pretty.</b>

847
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:00,579
<b>Mr. Ku's always around ghosts,</b>

848
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:02,810
<b>so he should meet a lot of humans when he can.</b>

849
00:57:03,781 --> 00:57:05,849
<b>If he ends up growing old...</b>

850
00:57:05,850 --> 00:57:08,691
<b>all by himself just like Mr. No did,</b>

851
00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:10,390
<b>I'd feel so sorry for him.</b>

852
00:57:14,190 --> 00:57:17,531
<b>Ms. Jang, I hope you eat a lot of delicious stuff at the beach.</b>

853
00:57:17,730 --> 00:57:18,930
<b>Hyun Joong.</b>

854
00:57:19,131 --> 00:57:21,970
<b>Tell the guests to empty the hotel beach within 30 minutes.</b>

855
00:57:23,230 --> 00:57:24,441
<b>I want to take a rest there.</b>

856
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:27,241
<b>I thought you were going to go to a beach far away.</b>

857
00:57:27,370 --> 00:57:29,571
<b>Why would I go? They're all the same anyway.</b>

858
00:57:30,241 --> 00:57:31,381
<b>I'm...</b>

859
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:33,810
<b>not going.</b>

860
00:57:36,850 --> 00:57:38,520
<b>Should I buy you some webfoot octopus?</b>

861
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,419
<b>You acted like you were never going to come back to Korea.</b>

862
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:43,520
<b>But here you are.</b>

863
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:46,289
<b>Are you nervous to see me here since it was so unexpected?</b>

864
00:57:46,290 --> 00:57:48,231
<b>I'm just glad to see you.</b>

865
00:57:49,131 --> 00:57:51,099
<b>I found it weird that you suddenly showed up,</b>

866
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:52,361
<b>so I asked around.</b>

867
00:57:52,361 --> 00:57:53,599
<b>I heard you took out a loan...</b>

868
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:54,829
<b>and got kicked out from your parents' house.</b>

869
00:57:54,830 --> 00:57:56,171
<b>It was only a small amount.</b>

870
00:57:56,471 --> 00:57:58,740
<b>I'm a doctor. I'll quickly be able to pay it off.</b>

871
00:57:58,741 --> 00:58:00,970
<b>Is that so? That's good to hear.</b>

872
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,441
<b>I don't have much time, so let's cut to the chase.</b>

873
00:58:03,571 --> 00:58:05,840
<b>I want my 5,000 dollars back.</b>

874
00:58:05,841 --> 00:58:08,450
<b>It's been ages since we last met. Let's not talk about money.</b>

875
00:58:08,451 --> 00:58:11,320
<b>I'm only talking about money because it's been a long time.</b>

876
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:14,349
<b>Otherwise, I would've sued you.</b>

877
00:58:14,350 --> 00:58:16,490
<b>I don't believe you.</b>

878
00:58:16,491 --> 00:58:18,860
<b>I know how much you loved me.</b>

879
00:58:18,861 --> 00:58:20,620
<b>You'll never sue me.</b>

880
00:58:22,361 --> 00:58:24,229
<b>You're right. When you told me your family was struggling with money...</b>

881
00:58:24,230 --> 00:58:26,300
<b>and asked me to lend you 5,000 dollars,</b>

882
00:58:26,301 --> 00:58:29,830
<b>I liked you so much that I even gave you money from my tuition.</b>

883
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,200
<b>Chan Seong.</b>

884
00:58:31,370 --> 00:58:35,071
<b>Try to remember how much you liked me back then.</b>

885
00:58:36,210 --> 00:58:38,939
<b>First, let me calculate how much you need to pay me back.</b>

886
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:40,950
<b>Gosh, I'll pay you back.</b>

887
00:58:40,951 --> 00:58:43,881
<b>But I actually called you because I really missed you.</b>

888
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:45,580
<b>It's so nice to see you again.</b>

889
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:47,119
<b>I guess you're still hopeless.</b>

890
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:48,591
<b>And it's still charming, isn't it?</b>

891
00:58:50,091 --> 00:58:51,290
<b>Okay, fine.</b>

892
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:57,330
<b>That's enough. You have a bad stomach.</b>

893
00:58:58,861 --> 00:59:00,401
<b>You haven't changed either.</b>

894
00:59:01,801 --> 00:59:05,640
<b>Chan Seong, I heard you're single.</b>

895
00:59:05,670 --> 00:59:06,901
<b>Just a second.</b>

896
00:59:21,650 --> 00:59:24,220
<b>Excuse me. Wait up!</b>

897
00:59:45,561 --> 00:59:48,091
<b>Excuse me. Wait up!</b>

898
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:11,580
<b>- Yes? - Mr. Kim Joon Hyun.</b>

899
01:00:11,681 --> 01:00:12,850
<b>Yes?</b>

900
01:00:14,351 --> 01:00:16,591
<b>- Can I get an autograph? - Sure.</b>

901
01:00:18,491 --> 01:00:19,661
<b>You must have run here.</b>

902
01:00:21,690 --> 01:00:23,089
<b>Wait. Let me borrow your back.</b>

903
01:00:23,090 --> 01:00:25,361
<b>- My back? - Yes. It has to be flat.</b>

904
01:00:26,661 --> 01:00:27,971
<b>What's your name?</b>

905
01:00:27,971 --> 01:00:30,129
<b>- It's Jang Man Weol. - Jang Man Weol.</b>

906
01:00:30,130 --> 01:00:32,301
<b>She's a huge fan.</b>

907
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:36,270
<b>Thank her for me. What a great name.</b>

908
01:00:36,741 --> 01:00:37,881
<b>Okay.</b>

909
01:00:39,210 --> 01:00:40,310
<b>Bye.</b>

910
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:42,011
<b>- Excuse me. - Yes?</b>

911
01:00:42,750 --> 01:00:44,080
<b>Can we take a photo too?</b>

912
01:00:44,781 --> 01:00:46,180
<b>She doesn't trust people easily.</b>

913
01:00:46,181 --> 01:00:49,951
<b>She doesn't trust people? I see. Sure, let's take one.</b>

914
01:00:50,090 --> 01:00:51,390
<b>People take photos these days.</b>

915
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:54,530
<b>How should I pose? All right.</b>

916
01:00:54,531 --> 01:00:56,531
<b>1, 2, 3.</b>

917
01:01:08,170 --> 01:01:10,011
<b>(Ms. Jang)</b>

918
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:12,940
<b>I was just about to call you.</b>

919
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:16,250
<b>- I just met someone. - Ku Chan Seong.</b>

920
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:19,281
<b>Take the day off. Don't come.</b>

921
01:01:21,290 --> 01:01:23,020
<b>What about our trip to the sea?</b>

922
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:26,020
<b>I can go to the sea at the hotel too.</b>

923
01:01:26,221 --> 01:01:27,721
<b>It's all the same, anyway.</b>

924
01:01:28,190 --> 01:01:29,531
<b>I don't have to go. Take the day off.</b>

925
01:01:36,701 --> 01:01:40,071
<b>(To Jang Man Weol, I love you!)</b>

926
01:03:12,561 --> 01:03:13,861
<b>You're here.</b>

927
01:03:14,630 --> 01:03:16,131
<b>How did you find me here?</b>

928
01:03:16,831 --> 01:03:18,241
<b>Yeon Woo told me.</b>

929
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:24,170
<b>You should have told me first if you found a good place like this.</b>

930
01:03:24,781 --> 01:03:26,310
<b>Don't keep it to yourself.</b>

931
01:03:26,811 --> 01:03:28,681
<b>It's a good place to drink alone.</b>

932
01:03:29,411 --> 01:03:30,580
<b>Get lost.</b>

933
01:04:49,531 --> 01:04:53,161
<b>Now do you realize this view is much better than the previous one?</b>

934
01:04:57,801 --> 01:05:00,270
<b>Fireflies are all the same. They aren't that different.</b>

935
01:05:00,540 --> 01:05:01,710
<b>Of course, they are.</b>

936
01:05:01,911 --> 01:05:05,710
<b>Before, you were alone. But now, I'm here with you.</b>

937
01:05:09,610 --> 01:05:12,651
<b>Every sight you see with me will look different.</b>

938
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:22,091
<b>From now on, drinking alone here won't make you happy.</b>

939
01:05:23,491 --> 01:05:24,901
<b>Mark my words.</b>

940
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:29,730
<b>You'll be waiting for me to suddenly show up like today.</b>

941
01:07:00,861 --> 01:07:04,590
<b>The tree I'm growing at Guest House of the Moon...</b>

942
01:07:04,931 --> 01:07:07,031
<b>used to be as stiff as a rock.</b>

943
01:07:07,361 --> 01:07:09,371
<b>But it's starting to look pretty now.</b>

944
01:07:11,071 --> 01:07:15,211
<b>I guess the man you sent is taking good care of the tree.</b>

945
01:07:15,271 --> 01:07:17,440
<b>You sent him there because you thought he was the remedy,</b>

946
01:07:17,471 --> 01:07:18,940
<b>but he might turn out to be poison.</b>

947
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:24,510
<b>Love can be one's remedy and poison.</b>

948
01:07:24,821 --> 01:07:27,321
<b>But it's so hard to weave them together.</b>

949
01:07:29,691 --> 01:07:31,791
<b>Darn it. It's tangled again.</b>

950
01:07:32,821 --> 01:07:34,291
<b>Darn it. What should I do?</b>

951
01:07:34,691 --> 01:07:36,130
<b>Darn it. Goodness.</b>

952
01:07:42,170 --> 01:07:46,770
<b>(Rich boy, do you want to grab a sandwich with me?)</b>

953
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:50,611
<b>No. Asking a ghost to have a sandwich with me sounds weird.</b>

954
01:07:53,380 --> 01:07:54,581
<b>What should I say?</b>

955
01:08:04,391 --> 01:08:05,491
<b>What was that?</b>

956
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:07,821
<b>That felt creepy just now.</b>

957
01:08:10,261 --> 01:08:11,560
<b>(Hey, anything fun these days?)</b>

958
01:08:11,561 --> 01:08:12,760
<b>(Somebody, send me some fun stuff.)</b>

959
01:08:12,761 --> 01:08:14,230
<b>(This.)</b>

960
01:08:14,231 --> 01:08:16,699
<b>(It's going viral. If you're scared, don't open it.)</b>

961
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:19,640
<b>(It's that famous video. I didn't watch it.)</b>

962
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:21,371
<b>He's trying to scare me.</b>

963
01:08:28,851 --> 01:08:30,050
<b>Are you enjoying this?</b>

964
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:32,020
<b>You like this?</b>

965
01:08:34,750 --> 01:08:35,890
<b>I'm hot, aren't I?</b>

966
01:09:07,681 --> 01:09:10,249
<b>Ms. Jang is on the beach by herself?</b>

967
01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:12,520
<b>Yes, she told me not to let anyone in.</b>

968
01:09:33,580 --> 01:09:35,779
<b>The Air Handling Unit, right? I'm on the beach now.</b>

969
01:09:35,780 --> 01:09:37,510
<b>The sun is too strong now!</b>

970
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:39,281
<b>I don't want 12pm.</b>

971
01:09:40,580 --> 01:09:43,951
<b>How about around 6pm? Change the setting to sundown.</b>

972
01:09:56,571 --> 01:09:59,270
<b>Whether the sun is blazing or goes down,</b>

973
01:10:01,571 --> 01:10:03,840
<b>the beach looks the same.</b>

974
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:08,140
<b>I should ask them to make the waves stronger.</b>

975
01:10:10,151 --> 01:10:11,581
<b>The beach will still look the same.</b>

976
01:10:14,250 --> 01:10:15,651
<b>Why are you here?</b>

977
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:17,821
<b>You refused to go to the beach with me.</b>

978
01:10:22,460 --> 01:10:23,630
<b>I just wanted...</b>

979
01:10:25,030 --> 01:10:26,199
<b>to laugh a little.</b>

980
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:27,300
<b>You wanted to laugh?</b>

981
01:10:27,660 --> 01:10:29,300
<b>You and your capricious mind.</b>

982
01:10:30,330 --> 01:10:32,041
<b>I told you to rest. What are you doing here?</b>

983
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:34,640
<b>I did something silly,</b>

984
01:10:35,540 --> 01:10:37,871
<b>but I can't tell you what I did because you might laugh at me.</b>

985
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:40,041
<b>What did you do?</b>

986
01:10:40,481 --> 01:10:43,310
<b>- Don't laugh. - I'm not in the mood. What is it?</b>

987
01:10:51,821 --> 01:10:53,560
<b>(To Ms. Jang Man Weol, I love you.)</b>

988
01:10:59,301 --> 01:11:00,531
<b>Doesn't it make you happy?</b>

989
01:11:01,901 --> 01:11:04,770
<b>"To Ms. Jang Man Weol, I love you"?</b>

990
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:07,741
<b>Are you professing your love to me?</b>

991
01:11:08,170 --> 01:11:11,241
<b>No! I didn't write this.</b>

992
01:11:11,981 --> 01:11:14,340
<b>This is Kim Joon Hyun's autograph. Here, "Kim Joon Hyun".</b>

993
01:11:14,910 --> 01:11:16,211
<b>Kim Joon Hyun?</b>

994
01:11:19,351 --> 01:11:21,749
<b>- It's true. - I ran after him and asked him...</b>

995
01:11:21,750 --> 01:11:24,590
<b>for an autograph on the streets even though I was so embarrassed.</b>

996
01:11:24,891 --> 01:11:26,161
<b>I thought it'd make you happy.</b>

997
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:33,961
<b>Are you not happy?</b>

998
01:11:38,071 --> 01:11:39,241
<b>I am.</b>

999
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:43,640
<b>I love this.</b>

1000
01:11:48,580 --> 01:11:49,850
<b>I knew you'd like it.</b>

1001
01:11:52,750 --> 01:11:54,121
<b>I felt so shy...</b>

1002
01:11:54,950 --> 01:11:56,421
<b>about asking for an autograph.</b>

1003
01:12:03,490 --> 01:12:06,361
<b>It's nice to come to this beach instead of going somewhere far.</b>

1004
01:12:07,330 --> 01:12:08,730
<b>Although there's no webfoot octopus here.</b>

1005
01:12:14,340 --> 01:12:15,541
<b>That's okay.</b>

1006
01:12:17,710 --> 01:12:19,081
<b>Because you're here.</b>

1007
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:28,451
<b>The ocean looks beautiful.</b>

1008
01:12:34,021 --> 01:12:35,161
<b>Yes, indeed.</b>

1009
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:40,060
<b>It makes me sad.</b>

1010
01:12:51,210 --> 01:12:52,380
<b>I'm...</b>

1011
01:12:55,410 --> 01:12:56,680
<b>a little sad...</b>

1012
01:13:00,551 --> 01:13:02,190
<b>because the ocean...</b>

1013
01:13:04,450 --> 01:13:06,291
<b>looks more beautiful now...</b>

1014
01:13:10,731 --> 01:13:11,930
<b>than it did earlier.</b>

1015
01:14:17,761 --> 01:14:21,630
<b>(Hotel Del Luna)</b>

1016
01:14:22,256 --> 01:14:23,955
<b>Since you can see my past,</b>

1017
01:14:24,126 --> 01:14:27,825
<b>you'll gradually find out how much of a horrible person I was.</b>

1018
01:14:27,966 --> 01:14:29,266
<b>You can't do this here, sir.</b>

1019
01:14:29,996 --> 01:14:31,165
<b>Just leave him be.</b>

1020
01:14:31,166 --> 01:14:33,465
<b>Enjoy the bloodshed until your anger subsides.</b>

1021
01:14:33,466 --> 01:14:35,636
<b>All right. Pick one.</b>

1022
01:14:36,235 --> 01:14:37,274
<b>Lee Mi Ra.</b>

1023
01:14:37,275 --> 01:14:38,904
<b>I invited you to the hotel.</b>

1024
01:14:38,905 --> 01:14:41,045
<b>A mere dream can't lead you to the hotel.</b>

1025
01:14:41,076 --> 01:14:42,276
<b>Only death can.</b>
