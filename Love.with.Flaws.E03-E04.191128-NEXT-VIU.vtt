<b>You. It's you.</b>

00:00:11.659 --> 00:00:14.303
<b>Yes, it was you.</b>

00:00:24.108 --> 00:00:26.084
<b>Hey, are you okay?</b>

00:00:58.678 --> 00:00:59.753
<b>What's with him?</b>

00:01:16.188 --> 00:01:17.334
<b>No, I can't go here.</b>

00:02:16.318 --> 00:02:17.389
<b>What are you doing here?</b>

00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:19.634
<b>Why did you leave already? I came over in a hurry.</b>

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:28.974
<b>Hey.</b>

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:35.784
<b>Yes.</b>

00:02:36.568 --> 00:02:37.983
<b>Things happen.</b>

00:02:39.179 --> 00:02:40.654
<b>Things do happen.</b>

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:12.109
<b>Let's go!</b>

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:14.279
<b>- Let's go! - Let's go!</b>

00:03:14.279 --> 00:03:15.709
<b>I know a place nearby!</b>

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.378
<b>- I can't go. - Come on!</b>

00:03:18.378 --> 00:03:19.418
<b>Let's go!</b>

00:03:19.418 --> 00:03:21.718
<b>Let's go bar hopping. You guys are coming, right?</b>

00:03:21.718 --> 00:03:22.889
<b>We'll pass.</b>

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:25.019
<b>Send her home and join us.</b>

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.559
<b>How can I do that? Go without me.</b>

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:29.863
<b>- Come on. - Let's go.</b>

00:03:31.658 --> 00:03:33.198
<b>She's causing a scene again.</b>

00:03:33.198 --> 00:03:34.598
<b>Just go.</b>

00:03:34.598 --> 00:03:36.068
<b>- Bye. - Bye.</b>

00:03:36.068 --> 00:03:37.538
<b>- Bye. - Bye.</b>

00:03:37.538 --> 00:03:39.714
<b>- Bye. - Bye.</b>

00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:42.609
<b>- Are they gone? - Yes.</b>

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:45.179
<b>How much did you eat? You're so heavy.</b>

00:03:45.179 --> 00:03:48.348
<b>You could've just said no. Why did you make me do this?</b>

00:03:48.348 --> 00:03:50.878
<b>Hey, I should keep my dignity.</b>

00:03:50.878 --> 00:03:52.748
<b>Don't you know that they're completely mesmerized...</b>

00:03:52.748 --> 00:03:54.064
<b>by this face and my occupation?</b>

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:55.448
<b>They need to know their place.</b>

00:03:55.448 --> 00:03:57.658
<b>You're really irritating, you know?</b>

00:03:57.658 --> 00:03:59.119
<b>Look who's talking.</b>

00:03:59.119 --> 00:04:00.589
<b>Just like how you judge men by their looks,</b>

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:03.164
<b>I judge men by their looks, competence, and wealth.</b>

00:04:03.258 --> 00:04:04.429
<b>You're going to drink more, right?</b>

00:04:04.429 --> 00:04:05.529
<b>Let's go back to my place.</b>

00:04:05.529 --> 00:04:07.998
<b>Are you crazy? I can't meet your brothers like this.</b>

00:04:07.998 --> 00:04:09.098
<b>Over my dead body.</b>

00:04:09.098 --> 00:04:10.968
<b>Hey, my oldest brother is a gold digger,</b>

00:04:10.968 --> 00:04:12.113
<b>and the second oldest brother is...</b>

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:14.209
<b>Well, you know.</b>

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:16.639
<b>Even if I can't date them, I do want to look pretty...</b>

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:18.379
<b>in front of handsome men.</b>

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:20.014
<b>We're going to my place.</b>

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.379
<b>Your house is so far away!</b>

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:24.693
<b>- Let's go! - And they're not home yet!</b>

00:04:25.249 --> 00:04:26.423
<b>Follow me!</b>

00:04:27.149 --> 00:04:29.493
<b>It's so far away!</b>

00:04:29.718 --> 00:04:31.394
<b>One more drink</b>

00:04:31.558 --> 00:04:33.503
<b>One more drink</b>

00:04:35.728 --> 00:04:37.358
<b>Have you been well?</b>

00:04:37.358 --> 00:04:38.873
<b>Cheers.</b>

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:42.928
<b>Hey, it's been a while.</b>

00:04:42.928 --> 00:04:45.368
<b>It has been. Have you been well?</b>

00:04:45.368 --> 00:04:47.439
<b>Of course. Why haven't you been coming here?</b>

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:48.584
<b>Won Jae.</b>

00:04:50.738 --> 00:04:51.983
<b>It's because of her.</b>

00:04:54.749 --> 00:04:56.548
<b>Won Jae, about last time...</b>

00:04:56.548 --> 00:04:58.423
<b>I didn't know how scary you were.</b>

00:04:59.019 --> 00:05:00.418
<b>I heard you grabbed my sister by the hair.</b>

00:05:00.418 --> 00:05:04.594
<b>That's because you guys really didn't look alike.</b>

00:05:07.658 --> 00:05:08.834
<b>Do you have more to say?</b>

00:05:10.598 --> 00:05:11.904
<b>I hate you.</b>

00:05:14.999 --> 00:05:16.798
<b>I thought you tried really hard to win her heart.</b>

00:05:16.798 --> 00:05:19.873
<b>Hey, I need to get married as well, you know?</b>

00:05:20.168 --> 00:05:21.914
<b>I can't always be fooling around.</b>

00:05:22.668 --> 00:05:23.914
<b>Have fun.</b>

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:29.383
<b>Did you call for a chauffeur?</b>

00:05:29.908 --> 00:05:33.149
<b>Yes. My car's coming, so could you wait a minute?</b>

00:05:33.149 --> 00:05:35.288
<b>Okay, then. I'll have a smoke.</b>

00:05:35.288 --> 00:05:36.394
<b>Sure.</b>

00:05:52.368 --> 00:05:53.543
<b>What are you doing?</b>

00:06:01.079 --> 00:06:03.183
<b>Here. Park it.</b>

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:19.034
<b>- Thank you. - Thank you.</b>

00:06:27.168 --> 00:06:28.243
<b>Hey.</b>

00:06:29.308 --> 00:06:31.183
<b>Show some manners when you pay.</b>

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:33.923
<b>Don't you know your actions speak louder than words?</b>

00:06:53.868 --> 00:06:55.043
<b>Who is she?</b>

00:06:56.668 --> 00:06:58.699
<b>Hashtag, a glass of beer late at night.</b>

00:06:58.699 --> 00:07:00.569
<b>Hashtag, anyone wants to drink with me?</b>

00:07:00.569 --> 00:07:02.313
<b>Hashtag, feeling sentimental.</b>

00:07:03.709 --> 00:07:04.954
<b>Let's drink now.</b>

00:07:10.079 --> 00:07:11.354
<b>This is refreshing.</b>

00:07:12.319 --> 00:07:14.348
<b>Didn't your mom come last week?</b>

00:07:14.348 --> 00:07:15.493
<b>Yes, why?</b>

00:07:16.189 --> 00:07:19.733
<b>Didn't she clean your room?</b>

00:07:19.788 --> 00:07:20.904
<b>So?</b>

00:07:21.358 --> 00:07:23.428
<b>It's only been a few days, but your room is...</b>

00:07:23.428 --> 00:07:24.959
<b>Is what?</b>

00:07:24.959 --> 00:07:26.534
<b>Forget it. Let's just drink.</b>

00:07:27.298 --> 00:07:31.414
<b>Were you really Kang Woo's first love?</b>

00:07:33.199 --> 00:07:35.608
<b>I'm not sure about being his first love,</b>

00:07:35.608 --> 00:07:37.038
<b>but he said he liked me.</b>

00:07:37.038 --> 00:07:38.613
<b>Really? And?</b>

00:07:38.639 --> 00:07:40.478
<b>I don't remember.</b>

00:07:40.478 --> 00:07:43.224
<b>Come to think of it, he never returned to the restaurant.</b>

00:07:43.779 --> 00:07:44.819
<b>I think you're right.</b>

00:07:44.819 --> 00:07:46.019
<b>What a strange guy.</b>

00:07:46.019 --> 00:07:49.363
<b>Look at you. Weren't you sitting next to him the entire time?</b>

00:07:50.658 --> 00:07:53.193
<b>At first, I was infatuated with his looks.</b>

00:07:53.319 --> 00:07:55.058
<b>But I think that's all that he has.</b>

00:07:55.058 --> 00:07:57.199
<b>Hey, isn't it obvious?</b>

00:07:57.199 --> 00:08:00.373
<b>His face is screaming, "I am a fraudster."</b>

00:08:00.728 --> 00:08:03.574
<b>Right. Once Anus, always Anus.</b>

00:08:03.868 --> 00:08:05.769
<b>By the way, why is that his nickname?</b>

00:08:05.769 --> 00:08:07.943
<b>Don't you remember our field trip?</b>

00:08:09.308 --> 00:08:10.613
<b>I couldn't go.</b>

00:08:13.709 --> 00:08:14.854
<b>Oh, right.</b>

00:08:18.949 --> 00:08:20.094
<b>Cheers.</b>

00:08:24.058 --> 00:08:26.759
<b>So why did you call him Anus?</b>

00:08:26.759 --> 00:08:28.363
<b>Because that obese kid pooped himself.</b>

00:08:29.029 --> 00:08:30.204
<b>What?</b>

00:08:56.548 --> 00:08:58.194
<b>Coming.</b>

00:09:02.489 --> 00:09:03.704
<b>Who is it?</b>

00:09:13.298 --> 00:09:15.214
<b>It's so late at night.</b>

00:09:16.168 --> 00:09:17.814
<b>You should've scheduled an appointment first.</b>

00:09:18.208 --> 00:09:19.509
<b>Why is he so strong?</b>

00:09:19.509 --> 00:09:21.084
<b>My foot, my foot!</b>

00:09:34.759 --> 00:09:37.574
<b>That woman was the cause of all this!</b>

00:09:40.668 --> 00:09:41.804
<b>I don't like you.</b>

00:09:48.969 --> 00:09:50.044
<b>I don't like you...</b>

00:09:51.109 --> 00:09:52.354
<b>because you're ugly...</b>

00:09:53.749 --> 00:09:55.383
<b>and fat.</b>

00:10:03.238 --> 00:10:04.344
<b>I don't like you...</b>

00:10:04.868 --> 00:10:06.344
<b>because you're ugly...</b>

00:10:06.539 --> 00:10:08.514
<b>and fat.</b>

00:10:10.409 --> 00:10:13.854
<b>Son, have some snacks.</b>

00:10:15.079 --> 00:10:17.218
<b>It's cake, your favorite.</b>

00:10:17.218 --> 00:10:19.618
<b>No, thanks. I don't want it.</b>

00:10:19.618 --> 00:10:21.659
<b>- Why not? - I don't want it.</b>

00:10:21.659 --> 00:10:23.388
<b>- What's wrong? - I don't want it.</b>

00:10:23.388 --> 00:10:24.958
<b>Why are you refusing to eat?</b>

00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.374
<b>- I don't want it. - Oh, dear.</b>

00:10:28.559 --> 00:10:29.874
<b>For about four days,</b>

00:10:30.769 --> 00:10:32.303
<b>I ate nothing.</b>

00:10:34.498 --> 00:10:35.844
<b>Not even a drop of water.</b>

00:10:42.478 --> 00:10:43.854
<b>Really?</b>

00:10:48.618 --> 00:10:50.293
<b>- Let's go. - Okay.</b>

00:10:52.718 --> 00:10:56.734
<b>What's even more shocking was that after looking down on me like that,</b>

00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:59.134
<b>she suddenly contacted me late at night.</b>

00:11:11.238 --> 00:11:14.154
<b>I have something to say. What's your address?</b>

00:11:14.708 --> 00:11:15.884
<b>I'll go there right now.</b>

00:11:16.439 --> 00:11:17.984
<b>What did she say?</b>

00:11:18.179 --> 00:11:20.823
<b>She didn't come. My gosh.</b>

00:11:21.079 --> 00:11:22.754
<b>She toyed with me.</b>

00:11:25.488 --> 00:11:27.433
<b>Feeling humiliated and enraged,</b>

00:11:28.118 --> 00:11:30.033
<b>I could no longer hold it in.</b>

00:11:33.059 --> 00:11:34.404
<b>I wasn't myself.</b>

00:11:35.159 --> 00:11:38.404
<b>I even forgot that I was going on a field trip the day after.</b>

00:11:38.899 --> 00:11:40.998
<b>- Have some of this. - I have snacks.</b>

00:11:40.998 --> 00:11:44.484
<b>The restrooms at the rest area were all full that day.</b>

00:11:45.169 --> 00:11:48.984
<b>So I tried my best to hold it in until we arrived at our lodging.</b>

00:11:49.079 --> 00:11:52.079
<b>I'm telling you. It's true.</b>

00:11:52.079 --> 00:11:53.683
<b>What is this smell?</b>

00:11:55.679 --> 00:11:57.154
<b>My gosh!</b>

00:11:57.248 --> 00:11:59.264
<b>Kang Woo pooped!</b>

00:12:00.248 --> 00:12:03.094
<b>- What? - Seriously?</b>

00:12:03.858 --> 00:12:06.134
<b>- No way! - That's disgusting!</b>

00:12:07.258 --> 00:12:09.673
<b>I'm going to sit elsewhere.</b>

00:12:18.909 --> 00:12:21.953
<b>So this woman is...</b>

00:12:23.809 --> 00:12:26.779
<b>Joo Seo Yeon! Had it not been for her,</b>

00:12:26.779 --> 00:12:29.154
<b>I wouldn't have gone on a diet or get humiliated like that!</b>

00:12:29.218 --> 00:12:30.323
<b>All right.</b>

00:12:31.388 --> 00:12:33.594
<b>Okay, calm down.</b>

00:12:36.758 --> 00:12:38.004
<b>Sit.</b>

00:12:48.899 --> 00:12:50.399
<b>Because of that incident,</b>

00:12:50.399 --> 00:12:52.783
<b>you're suffering from irritable bowel syndrome.</b>

00:12:54.108 --> 00:12:57.354
<b>In addition, you have a hard time forging relationships with women.</b>

00:12:58.149 --> 00:13:00.083
<b>- What? - Is that not true?</b>

00:13:00.208 --> 00:13:02.149
<b>When I summed up what you just told me,</b>

00:13:02.149 --> 00:13:03.718
<b>since that day,</b>

00:13:03.718 --> 00:13:06.563
<b>you never had a special feeling for another woman.</b>

00:13:06.819 --> 00:13:07.894
<b>You were never...</b>

00:13:08.618 --> 00:13:09.764
<b>able to date a woman, right?</b>

00:13:11.888 --> 00:13:14.374
<b>It wasn't that I wasn't able to. I chose not to date them.</b>

00:13:14.429 --> 00:13:16.529
<b>Why is that? You're handsome and attractive.</b>

00:13:16.529 --> 00:13:17.769
<b>That's why...</b>

00:13:17.769 --> 00:13:20.073
<b>I'm waiting for the perfect woman who deserves me.</b>

00:13:28.138 --> 00:13:29.878
<b>To Lee Kang Woo at the age of 15,</b>

00:13:29.878 --> 00:13:31.884
<b>this woman was the perfect woman.</b>

00:13:31.909 --> 00:13:33.348
<b>And he was rejected.</b>

00:13:33.348 --> 00:13:36.154
<b>You are still the same 15-year-old boy.</b>

00:13:36.248 --> 00:13:38.163
<b>You still have the fear of getting rejected.</b>

00:13:38.789 --> 00:13:40.293
<b>You're chained to that fear.</b>

00:13:41.618 --> 00:13:42.764
<b>Do you understand that?</b>

00:13:43.618 --> 00:13:46.063
<b>You're sick of suffering from diarrhea.</b>

00:13:47.699 --> 00:13:50.004
<b>You will get better once you make peace with this woman.</b>

00:13:55.005 --> 00:14:00.005


00:14:04.848 --> 00:14:07.348
<b>My goodness, you have sensitive skin.</b>

00:14:07.348 --> 00:14:09.923
<b>Why do you apply so much cosmetics?</b>

00:14:12.118 --> 00:14:14.189
<b>You're pretty even without makeup.</b>

00:14:14.189 --> 00:14:16.333
<b>- Hey. - You startled me.</b>

00:14:16.358 --> 00:14:18.289
<b>If both of us aren't married until we're 40,</b>

00:14:18.289 --> 00:14:20.634
<b>we should live together, okay?</b>

00:14:23.329 --> 00:14:27.913
<b>All right. This is our ring.</b>

00:14:28.399 --> 00:14:29.474
<b>Okay?</b>

00:14:32.838 --> 00:14:34.713
<b>Okay. Just go to sleep.</b>

00:14:49.819 --> 00:14:52.634
<b>Are you out of your mind? Did you drive after you drank?</b>

00:14:52.728 --> 00:14:54.029
<b>No.</b>

00:14:54.029 --> 00:14:55.203
<b>How...</b>

00:14:55.598 --> 00:14:57.498
<b>How could you be so reckless?</b>

00:14:57.498 --> 00:14:59.329
<b>Do you know what you have done?</b>

00:14:59.329 --> 00:15:01.098
<b>Hey. I called the chauffeur service.</b>

00:15:01.098 --> 00:15:04.014
<b>And I fell asleep in the car for a second. I just got up.</b>

00:15:05.738 --> 00:15:08.478
<b>Hey, you weren't the only one who suffered the loss.</b>

00:15:08.478 --> 00:15:10.083
<b>I suffered too just like you did.</b>

00:15:10.809 --> 00:15:12.923
<b>I get that I can be a jerk and all,</b>

00:15:14.049 --> 00:15:15.193
<b>but how could I?</b>

00:15:17.149 --> 00:15:18.348
<b>Really?</b>

00:15:18.348 --> 00:15:19.963
<b>Did people always lie to you?</b>

00:15:22.019 --> 00:15:23.163
<b>Did you drink?</b>

00:15:23.488 --> 00:15:25.888
<b>Yes. I drank a lot.</b>

00:15:25.888 --> 00:15:27.703
<b>But I sobered up quickly thanks to you.</b>

00:15:31.399 --> 00:15:32.943
<b>Our youngest must be alone.</b>

00:15:42.108 --> 00:15:43.279
<b>Why are you guys so late?</b>

00:15:43.279 --> 00:15:44.848
<b>I was scared to death all alone at home.</b>

00:15:44.848 --> 00:15:46.654
<b>Come on, you know how I get!</b>

00:15:46.748 --> 00:15:49.154
<b>Hey. Looking at you is scarier than being alone at home.</b>

00:15:50.478 --> 00:15:53.724
<b>- Darn it. - Stop wasting electricity.</b>

00:15:53.949 --> 00:15:55.358
<b>Money isn't important right now.</b>

00:15:55.358 --> 00:15:56.588
<b>I was scared at home.</b>

00:15:56.588 --> 00:15:57.904
<b>Of course, money is important.</b>

00:15:59.458 --> 00:16:00.529
<b>I'm going to sleep.</b>

00:16:00.529 --> 00:16:01.933
<b>Come on.</b>

00:16:02.598 --> 00:16:04.029
<b>I called you, but you didn't answer.</b>

00:16:04.029 --> 00:16:06.543
<b>When you don't answer my call, you know that I go crazy.</b>

00:16:07.329 --> 00:16:08.713
<b>Did you call me?</b>

00:16:09.138 --> 00:16:10.844
<b>I'm sorry. I didn't hear it ring.</b>

00:16:10.868 --> 00:16:12.443
<b>Goodness.</b>

00:16:19.008 --> 00:16:22.079
<b>Did you hear anything else about Joo Hee?</b>

00:16:22.079 --> 00:16:23.293
<b>I don't know.</b>

00:16:23.819 --> 00:16:27.193
<b>Gosh. She's been absent too many times.</b>

00:16:29.858 --> 00:16:31.264
<b>Stop playing. Go to sleep.</b>

00:16:33.588 --> 00:16:35.073
<b>I mean,</b>

00:16:35.258 --> 00:16:37.433
<b>I was so sleepy earlier,</b>

00:16:37.669 --> 00:16:38.799
<b>but I couldn't sleep...</b>

00:16:38.799 --> 00:16:40.604
<b>because no one was here, and now, I can't sleep.</b>

00:16:48.309 --> 00:16:50.949
<b>- Right. It's about Park Seok Min. - Who?</b>

00:16:50.949 --> 00:16:52.949
<b>The guy with the expensive cake.</b>

00:16:52.949 --> 00:16:54.894
<b>Oh, the guy with the cake?</b>

00:16:55.019 --> 00:16:56.193
<b>What about him?</b>

00:16:57.888 --> 00:17:00.549
<b>I heard Won Seok talking on the phone.</b>

00:17:00.549 --> 00:17:02.293
<b>I guess he's a regular at Won Seok's bar.</b>

00:17:02.319 --> 00:17:04.404
<b>- Really? - Yes, isn't that crazy?</b>

00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:07.928
<b>You. Don't you dare tell people about this.</b>

00:17:07.928 --> 00:17:09.334
<b>What do you take me for?</b>

00:17:11.098 --> 00:17:14.239
<b>My gosh, only handsome guys drink at Won Seok's bar.</b>

00:17:14.239 --> 00:17:16.213
<b>Hey, that's discriminating, isn't it?</b>

00:17:16.469 --> 00:17:19.009
<b>Racial discrimination isn't the only serious problem.</b>

00:17:19.009 --> 00:17:20.784
<b>- Seo Yeon. - What?</b>

00:17:20.938 --> 00:17:22.084
<b>You stink.</b>

00:17:22.239 --> 00:17:23.309
<b>There it is.</b>

00:17:23.309 --> 00:17:25.479
<b>- Darn it. Stop it. Come on. - There it is.</b>

00:17:25.479 --> 00:17:28.223
<b>Gosh, stop it. Take them away.</b>

00:18:01.118 --> 00:18:02.193
<b>What do you want?</b>

00:18:02.719 --> 00:18:05.693
<b>Well... Can I get some beer?</b>

00:18:12.489 --> 00:18:13.733
<b>Are you here for a scoop?</b>

00:18:14.299 --> 00:18:15.374
<b>Pardon?</b>

00:18:15.959 --> 00:18:17.804
<b>Or do you have a spycam somewhere?</b>

00:18:18.269 --> 00:18:21.039
<b>- Or is this for an online channel? - I don't follow.</b>

00:18:21.039 --> 00:18:22.273
<b>You know about this bar.</b>

00:18:22.969 --> 00:18:25.069
<b>You know this is a gay bar, don't you?</b>

00:18:25.069 --> 00:18:26.713
<b>Yes, I do.</b>

00:18:26.908 --> 00:18:28.483
<b>I just came here to have fun.</b>

00:18:29.838 --> 00:18:31.779
<b>I'm saying this because you could be my brother.</b>

00:18:31.779 --> 00:18:33.453
<b>This bar doesn't suit you.</b>

00:18:34.749 --> 00:18:36.054
<b>You'd know once you looked around.</b>

00:18:44.358 --> 00:18:46.163
<b>This is on the house. Drink it and leave.</b>

00:18:48.059 --> 00:18:49.134
<b>No, no.</b>

00:18:51.299 --> 00:18:53.203
<b>So tell me what happened next.</b>

00:18:53.569 --> 00:18:55.398
<b>I just kept drinking beer.</b>

00:18:55.398 --> 00:18:56.638
<b>I heard that's a good beer.</b>

00:18:56.638 --> 00:18:58.314
<b>I only drink that.</b>

00:19:25.598 --> 00:19:28.044
<b>You're sick of suffering from diarrhea.</b>

00:19:28.138 --> 00:19:30.814
<b>You will get better once you make peace with this woman.</b>

00:19:40.678 --> 00:19:43.394
<b>You will get better once you make peace with this woman.</b>

00:19:48.559 --> 00:19:52.104
<b>You will get better once you make peace with this woman.</b>

00:19:57.999 --> 00:20:00.503
<b>Darn it. Gosh.</b>

00:20:08.338 --> 00:20:11.654
<b>You will get better once you make peace...</b>

00:20:12.479 --> 00:20:16.223
<b>Fine! You said you didn't like me because I was fat and ugly!</b>

00:20:17.219 --> 00:20:20.294
<b>Joo Seo Yeon, it's my turn.</b>

00:20:20.749 --> 00:20:22.094
<b>You wait for me!</b>

00:20:25.658 --> 00:20:27.733
<b>Joo Seo Yeon!</b>

00:20:44.448 --> 00:20:47.284
<b>Goodness. Funny running into you here.</b>

00:20:49.249 --> 00:20:51.423
<b>You still haven't found Lee Joo Hee?</b>

00:20:53.219 --> 00:20:54.289
<b>- No. - I asked...</b>

00:20:54.289 --> 00:20:56.594
<b>the owner of the wine bar just in case.</b>

00:20:56.888 --> 00:20:58.463
<b>She really quit.</b>

00:20:59.729 --> 00:21:02.503
<b>Thank you for making the effort.</b>

00:21:03.459 --> 00:21:04.544
<b>Wait.</b>

00:21:06.569 --> 00:21:07.644
<b>Do you want it?</b>

00:21:09.898 --> 00:21:11.173
<b>It's really good.</b>

00:21:13.469 --> 00:21:16.108
<b>If you're doing this because of the flowerpot incident...</b>

00:21:16.108 --> 00:21:17.314
<b>No.</b>

00:21:17.638 --> 00:21:19.953
<b>It's good. So I thought sharing it would be nice.</b>

00:21:20.348 --> 00:21:21.523
<b>With me?</b>

00:21:22.479 --> 00:21:23.554
<b>Yes.</b>

00:21:35.029 --> 00:21:37.003
<b>What was that? What?</b>

00:21:37.698 --> 00:21:39.769
<b>Why is he being nice only after being mean to me?</b>

00:21:39.769 --> 00:21:41.844
<b>Is he mocking me?</b>

00:21:42.098 --> 00:21:44.314
<b>Hey, you should eat this.</b>

00:21:44.368 --> 00:21:45.443
<b>Okay.</b>

00:21:48.509 --> 00:21:51.324
<b>That's how she's interpreting his interest?</b>

00:21:51.809 --> 00:21:53.709
<b>I told you to choose a department to work in.</b>

00:21:53.709 --> 00:21:55.054
<b>You haven't given me your answer.</b>

00:21:56.019 --> 00:21:57.348
<b>I don't know.</b>

00:21:57.348 --> 00:21:59.064
<b>I knew you'd say that.</b>

00:21:59.348 --> 00:22:00.423
<b>Here.</b>

00:22:00.688 --> 00:22:03.193
<b>These are the places you can join with your qualifications.</b>

00:22:03.418 --> 00:22:04.733
<b>Just choose one.</b>

00:22:10.029 --> 00:22:12.229
<b>"Eeny, meeny, miny, moe."</b>

00:22:12.229 --> 00:22:13.304
<b>You brat.</b>

00:22:13.769 --> 00:22:15.938
<b>There are other people more qualified than I am.</b>

00:22:15.938 --> 00:22:17.438
<b>And you have your sister, your right-hand woman.</b>

00:22:17.438 --> 00:22:19.809
<b>Do I only need my right hand?</b>

00:22:19.809 --> 00:22:22.509
<b>I must have all of my limbs and my organs.</b>

00:22:22.509 --> 00:22:25.384
<b>Grandma, there's something else I want to do with my life.</b>

00:22:25.479 --> 00:22:27.348
<b>Can't you just let me do that?</b>

00:22:27.348 --> 00:22:29.618
<b>You can't be good at things...</b>

00:22:29.618 --> 00:22:31.963
<b>just because you want to be.</b>

00:22:32.118 --> 00:22:33.848
<b>I've seen countless people who ruined...</b>

00:22:33.848 --> 00:22:35.918
<b>their lives because they did only what they wanted to do.</b>

00:22:35.918 --> 00:22:38.789
<b>Whether I ruin my life or become successful,</b>

00:22:38.789 --> 00:22:40.134
<b>I'll face the consequence.</b>

00:22:40.529 --> 00:22:41.804
<b>You little...</b>

00:22:42.229 --> 00:22:43.503
<b>Mother.</b>

00:22:43.698 --> 00:22:45.569
<b>He's more stubborn than we anticipated.</b>

00:22:45.569 --> 00:22:47.344
<b>Let's go with the plan B.</b>

00:22:48.969 --> 00:22:51.584
<b>Excuse me. I can hear you just fine.</b>

00:22:52.509 --> 00:22:54.344
<b>What do you mean, plan B?</b>

00:22:54.469 --> 00:22:57.084
<b>Take charge of one of these places...</b>

00:22:57.239 --> 00:22:59.253
<b>and keep it going for a year.</b>

00:22:59.279 --> 00:23:02.019
<b>After you do that, I won't meddle with your life.</b>

00:23:02.019 --> 00:23:04.588
<b>- Grandma! - Can't you invest a year...</b>

00:23:04.588 --> 00:23:06.064
<b>for your freedom of lifetime?</b>

00:23:06.688 --> 00:23:09.193
<b>Or are you not confident enough?</b>

00:23:17.499 --> 00:23:20.344
<b>You promised. It's for a year.</b>

00:23:21.029 --> 00:23:22.144
<b>- Yes. - Goodness.</b>

00:23:25.108 --> 00:23:26.213
<b>I'm leaving.</b>

00:23:26.668 --> 00:23:29.354
<b>Okay, my son. Goodbye.</b>

00:23:30.579 --> 00:23:31.824
<b>Mother!</b>

00:23:34.009 --> 00:23:37.354
<b>- Goodness. - Yes, we gained a year.</b>

00:23:37.948 --> 00:23:40.588
<b>We'll get him married in that year and make him stay.</b>

00:23:40.588 --> 00:23:44.628
<b>Of course. I'll find the best wife materials.</b>

00:23:44.628 --> 00:23:45.628
<b>Good.</b>

00:23:45.628 --> 00:23:48.198
<b>This month's evaluation is really important. You know, right?</b>

00:23:48.198 --> 00:23:50.773
<b>- Really? - Mr. Park is coming in this month.</b>

00:23:51.059 --> 00:23:53.769
<b>Really? I've never seen him.</b>

00:23:53.769 --> 00:23:55.344
<b>Not a lot of trainees have seen him.</b>

00:23:55.638 --> 00:23:58.344
<b>I heard he'll decide on members who will debut after the evaluation.</b>

00:23:58.638 --> 00:24:01.239
<b>Why are you worried? You're such a good singer.</b>

00:24:01.239 --> 00:24:02.814
<b>Of course, you'll be the main vocalist.</b>

00:24:02.908 --> 00:24:05.324
<b>You can't survive in this industry just because you can sing.</b>

00:24:07.209 --> 00:24:11.294
<b>I wish I had a quarter of your looks.</b>

00:24:11.648 --> 00:24:14.663
<b>Come on. It's all about makeups and plastic surgery now.</b>

00:24:14.959 --> 00:24:16.894
<b>Don't worry. Don't worry at all.</b>

00:24:16.959 --> 00:24:19.203
<b>Right. Other than looks,</b>

00:24:19.688 --> 00:24:22.029
<b>I'm a better dancer and a singer than you.</b>

00:24:22.029 --> 00:24:25.168
<b>Gosh. How can you dis me like that to my face?</b>

00:24:25.168 --> 00:24:26.544
<b>I'm joking.</b>

00:24:28.168 --> 00:24:29.273
<b>Hey.</b>

00:24:30.698 --> 00:24:33.509
<b>- Do you want to go in first? - Why?</b>

00:24:33.509 --> 00:24:35.838
<b>- I have to meet someone. - Who?</b>

00:24:35.838 --> 00:24:38.554
<b>Well, this is personal.</b>

00:24:39.709 --> 00:24:41.953
<b>- Sure. - Bye.</b>

00:24:52.959 --> 00:24:54.263
<b>Aren't you Joo Hee?</b>

00:24:54.658 --> 00:24:56.128
<b>I'm Seo Jun. We're in the same class.</b>

00:24:56.128 --> 00:24:58.374
<b>I know. Everyone knows you at our school.</b>

00:24:58.499 --> 00:24:59.999
<b>I guess I'm quite famous.</b>

00:24:59.999 --> 00:25:01.374
<b>You like to show yourself off so much.</b>

00:25:04.198 --> 00:25:05.838
<b>Do you know that my sister is Ms. Joo?</b>

00:25:05.838 --> 00:25:07.239
<b>She's looking for you. Give her a call.</b>

00:25:07.239 --> 00:25:09.413
<b>- Mind your business. - She said you need attendance.</b>

00:25:09.979 --> 00:25:11.584
<b>I said, mind your business.</b>

00:25:17.118 --> 00:25:19.423
<b>I'm not doing this because I'm worried about you.</b>

00:25:20.148 --> 00:25:21.324
<b>Darn it.</b>

00:25:23.118 --> 00:25:26.003
<b>(Seo Yeon)</b>

00:25:38.309 --> 00:25:39.608
<b>Did you order chicken?</b>

00:25:39.608 --> 00:25:40.683
<b>Hey.</b>

00:25:45.148 --> 00:25:46.554
<b>It's a woman.</b>

00:25:47.648 --> 00:25:49.753
<b>There's no gender when it comes to delivering.</b>

00:25:51.719 --> 00:25:53.463
<b>- Do you want some too? - What?</b>

00:25:54.418 --> 00:25:55.963
<b>It's too boring for me to eat alone.</b>

00:25:58.829 --> 00:26:00.858
<b>You ordered all this for yourself?</b>

00:26:00.858 --> 00:26:02.259
<b>They all have different tastes.</b>

00:26:02.259 --> 00:26:03.933
<b>I wanted a bite of each flavor.</b>

00:26:04.459 --> 00:26:05.874
<b>Have some before you go.</b>

00:26:07.769 --> 00:26:10.213
<b>It's all right. That'll be 73 dollars.</b>

00:26:10.499 --> 00:26:11.683
<b>It's good, though.</b>

00:26:31.789 --> 00:26:33.229
<b>- That's my tip. - What?</b>

00:26:33.229 --> 00:26:35.003
<b>I don't like keeping change.</b>

00:26:35.628 --> 00:26:36.804
<b>Hey!</b>

00:26:38.898 --> 00:26:40.868
<b>- You little brat. - How did you know?</b>

00:26:40.868 --> 00:26:43.069
<b>I asked the store where you went to deliver.</b>

00:26:43.069 --> 00:26:44.239
<b>- Follow me. - Wait.</b>

00:26:44.239 --> 00:26:45.814
<b>I don't want to.</b>

00:26:47.668 --> 00:26:50.539
<b>Unbelievable. Did you just push me?</b>

00:26:50.539 --> 00:26:52.423
<b>Because you forced me to come.</b>

00:26:53.648 --> 00:26:57.854
<b>You're a big girl now. You grew up while you were away.</b>

00:27:14.069 --> 00:27:16.398
<b>No, my neck. My neck.</b>

00:27:16.398 --> 00:27:19.138
<b>- Ms. Joo, it really hurts. - You little brat.</b>

00:27:19.138 --> 00:27:21.009
<b>Don't you know how scary this world is?</b>

00:27:21.009 --> 00:27:23.183
<b>That hurts! It hurts!</b>

00:27:28.948 --> 00:27:30.023
<b>Ms. Joo!</b>

00:27:31.588 --> 00:27:32.923
<b>Is that your teacher?</b>

00:27:33.549 --> 00:27:35.493
<b>I thought she was a thief.</b>

00:27:39.529 --> 00:27:40.634
<b>Is she dead?</b>

00:27:41.489 --> 00:27:42.933
<b>She's breathing.</b>

00:27:43.398 --> 00:27:44.829
<b>Then should we take her to a doctor?</b>

00:27:44.829 --> 00:27:47.473
<b>I don't think she could get badly hurt from that.</b>

00:27:50.999 --> 00:27:52.713
<b>Ms. Joo, are you okay?</b>

00:27:52.969 --> 00:27:54.308
<b>Why am I here?</b>

00:27:54.309 --> 00:27:55.453
<b>I thought...</b>

00:27:56.709 --> 00:27:58.983
<b>a bad person was picking on the delivery woman.</b>

00:27:59.979 --> 00:28:01.084
<b>Sorry.</b>

00:28:06.247 --> 00:28:08.568
<b>(Episode 4 will air shortly.)</b>

00:28:09.714 --> 00:28:11.414
<b>I can't find a place that pays me more than them.</b>

00:28:11.414 --> 00:28:13.698
<b>You can't make me quit against my will!</b>

00:28:13.923 --> 00:28:16.229
<b>Doesn't that wine bar pay you more than this place?</b>

00:28:16.654 --> 00:28:19.523
<b>I can't believe this. A student working at a bar?</b>

00:28:19.523 --> 00:28:20.624
<b>That place isn't like that.</b>

00:28:20.624 --> 00:28:22.999
<b>How dare you talk back to me after what you did?</b>

00:28:23.694 --> 00:28:24.938
<b>Aren't you going to run?</b>

00:28:25.333 --> 00:28:26.539
<b>Don't you want to go to college?</b>

00:28:27.504 --> 00:28:28.778
<b>Can I make a living...</b>

00:28:29.164 --> 00:28:30.633
<b>by running?</b>

00:28:30.633 --> 00:28:31.734
<b>Look at me.</b>

00:28:31.734 --> 00:28:33.374
<b>I became a teacher and am making a living...</b>

00:28:33.374 --> 00:28:35.349
<b>because I ran that hard.</b>

00:28:36.204 --> 00:28:37.373
<b>And I got fame too.</b>

00:28:37.373 --> 00:28:39.548
<b>It's not a big deal to win a silver medal in the national meet.</b>

00:28:40.043 --> 00:28:42.844
<b>Hey, it's not that easy.</b>

00:28:42.844 --> 00:28:45.359
<b>And to be frank, do you have anything else you can do...</b>

00:28:45.553 --> 00:28:47.123
<b>other than running?</b>

00:28:47.123 --> 00:28:49.228
<b>Do you have a clear goal?</b>

00:28:51.693 --> 00:28:55.599
<b>So keep running for now because that's what you do best.</b>

00:28:55.863 --> 00:28:56.933
<b>You like to run too.</b>

00:28:56.933 --> 00:28:59.363
<b>You can't live your life only doing what you like.</b>

00:28:59.363 --> 00:29:01.539
<b>We all have our stories.</b>

00:29:02.433 --> 00:29:05.008
<b>What happened to your family? What about your older sister?</b>

00:29:05.104 --> 00:29:06.774
<b>She went head over heels for this guy...</b>

00:29:06.774 --> 00:29:07.848
<b>and ran off with all our money.</b>

00:29:08.773 --> 00:29:10.243
<b>Why didn't you tell me?</b>

00:29:10.243 --> 00:29:11.548
<b>Because it's humiliating.</b>

00:29:12.573 --> 00:29:14.243
<b>That doesn't humiliate you.</b>

00:29:14.243 --> 00:29:15.684
<b>Where did you stay?</b>

00:29:15.684 --> 00:29:16.883
<b>Where is your stuff?</b>

00:29:16.883 --> 00:29:18.288
<b>At a sauna.</b>

00:29:19.284 --> 00:29:20.359
<b>Let's go.</b>

00:29:20.984 --> 00:29:22.654
<b>My gosh.</b>

00:29:22.654 --> 00:29:25.693
<b>Both you and Seo Jun never listen to me.</b>

00:29:25.693 --> 00:29:27.264
<b>Are you two going through puberty all over again?</b>

00:29:27.264 --> 00:29:28.669
<b>Fine, I'll go.</b>

00:29:28.863 --> 00:29:30.139
<b>Have you been eating all right?</b>

00:29:42.443 --> 00:29:45.318
<b>Here. We don't use this room, so feel free to use it.</b>

00:29:46.374 --> 00:29:49.059
<b>It's like a room from "Anne of Green Gables".</b>

00:29:50.083 --> 00:29:53.083
<b>I said the same thing when I was a kid.</b>

00:29:53.083 --> 00:29:55.353
<b>You lived here since when you were a kid?</b>

00:29:55.353 --> 00:29:57.754
<b>Yes, since when I was 11.</b>

00:29:57.754 --> 00:29:58.969
<b>Your entire family?</b>

00:29:59.594 --> 00:30:02.169
<b>Then do your parents live with you?</b>

00:30:03.963 --> 00:30:06.579
<b>They passed away when I was in middle school.</b>

00:30:10.434 --> 00:30:12.879
<b>Is that why you're concerned about me?</b>

00:30:12.973 --> 00:30:14.548
<b>Because I remind me of you?</b>

00:30:15.374 --> 00:30:17.913
<b>No, it's because you're a good athlete.</b>

00:30:17.913 --> 00:30:19.744
<b>If you weren't good at running,</b>

00:30:19.744 --> 00:30:22.189
<b>I wouldn't have cared about you, not even this much.</b>

00:30:22.383 --> 00:30:23.789
<b>Why would I like you?</b>

00:30:24.383 --> 00:30:26.883
<b>You can reorganize the room as you'd like.</b>

00:30:26.883 --> 00:30:29.184
<b>I'll tell Seo Jun that you and I will use the bathroom...</b>

00:30:29.184 --> 00:30:30.494
<b>on the second floor.</b>

00:30:30.494 --> 00:30:33.793
<b>Seo Jun won't like how I'll get to stay here.</b>

00:30:33.793 --> 00:30:36.594
<b>If he doesn't like it, he can leave.</b>

00:30:36.594 --> 00:30:40.034
<b>Right, I have two more brothers other than him.</b>

00:30:40.034 --> 00:30:42.539
<b>But they rarely come upstairs, so don't mind them.</b>

00:30:43.404 --> 00:30:45.609
<b>You must be tired. Get some rest.</b>

00:30:46.543 --> 00:30:47.618
<b>Ms. Joo.</b>

00:30:49.344 --> 00:30:50.618
<b>Thank you.</b>

00:30:53.614 --> 00:30:56.284
<b>I don't think you get it yet.</b>

00:30:56.284 --> 00:30:58.284
<b>If you live under my roof,</b>

00:30:58.284 --> 00:31:00.998
<b>that means you should always be ready to be trained.</b>

00:31:01.154 --> 00:31:03.154
<b>You're under my control.</b>

00:31:03.154 --> 00:31:04.229
<b>Okay?</b>

00:31:12.293 --> 00:31:14.238
<b>That's why I'm even more thankful.</b>

00:31:16.834 --> 00:31:20.518
<b>One of my students will stay in the attic on the second floor.</b>

00:31:20.943 --> 00:31:22.274
<b>So keep that in your mind,</b>

00:31:22.274 --> 00:31:25.114
<b>and who wants to eat dinner at home?</b>

00:31:25.114 --> 00:31:26.883
<b>(One of my students will stay in the attic on the second floor.)</b>

00:31:26.883 --> 00:31:28.759
<b>(So keep that in your mind, and who wants to eat dinner at home?)</b>

00:31:31.084 --> 00:31:32.588
<b>(Message from Seo Yeon)</b>

00:31:34.184 --> 00:31:36.768
<b>(Message from Seo Yeon)</b>

00:31:45.964 --> 00:31:47.564
<b>(You received a new message.)</b>

00:31:47.564 --> 00:31:48.964
<b>(One of my students will stay in the attic on the second floor.)</b>

00:31:48.964 --> 00:31:50.404
<b>(So keep that in your mind, and who wants to eat dinner at home?)</b>

00:31:50.404 --> 00:31:52.879
<b>Is it that hard to reply?</b>

00:31:53.344 --> 00:31:55.618
<b>They've never replied back to any of my texts.</b>

00:31:55.973 --> 00:31:57.148
<b>Darn them.</b>

00:32:01.043 --> 00:32:04.389
<b>Joo Seo Yeon? Who was she again?</b>

00:32:05.254 --> 00:32:08.054
<b>How could you not remember her?</b>

00:32:08.054 --> 00:32:09.584
<b>I rarely attended those alumni meetings.</b>

00:32:09.584 --> 00:32:11.968
<b>You don't remember her from middle school?</b>

00:32:13.024 --> 00:32:14.238
<b>Was she pretty?</b>

00:32:14.624 --> 00:32:16.738
<b>That's strange. I remember all the pretty ones.</b>

00:32:19.794 --> 00:32:20.833
<b>Here.</b>

00:32:20.833 --> 00:32:23.648
<b>You even drew her?</b>

00:32:29.674 --> 00:32:31.044
<b>No wonder I couldn't remember her.</b>

00:32:31.044 --> 00:32:33.583
<b>She's Kim Mi Kyung's friend.</b>

00:32:33.583 --> 00:32:35.158
<b>- "Kim Mi Kyung"? - Yes.</b>

00:32:35.184 --> 00:32:37.283
<b>I've met her once.</b>

00:32:37.283 --> 00:32:38.759
<b>She's the leeching type.</b>

00:32:39.953 --> 00:32:41.199
<b>I'd like to meet her.</b>

00:32:43.453 --> 00:32:44.699
<b>Do you like her?</b>

00:32:45.294 --> 00:32:46.699
<b>So this was your ideal type?</b>

00:32:47.364 --> 00:32:48.499
<b>What do you think?</b>

00:32:48.564 --> 00:32:50.668
<b>No, right? Then why?</b>

00:32:51.164 --> 00:32:52.664
<b>I have business with her.</b>

00:32:52.664 --> 00:32:53.778
<b>Can you set us up right now?</b>

00:32:55.064 --> 00:32:56.379
<b>Give me five.</b>

00:33:05.414 --> 00:33:06.414
<b>Are you done?</b>

00:33:06.414 --> 00:33:08.684
<b>He's the only guy among our alumni who's decent!</b>

00:33:08.684 --> 00:33:10.759
<b>I told you about him! It's Park Hyun Soo!</b>

00:33:10.883 --> 00:33:11.958
<b>I don't know him.</b>

00:33:12.114 --> 00:33:14.783
<b>Anyway, he just called and wants to meet right now.</b>

00:33:14.783 --> 00:33:17.028
<b>- Good for you. - You should come too.</b>

00:33:17.953 --> 00:33:19.893
<b>- What? - He told me to bring a friend.</b>

00:33:19.893 --> 00:33:21.193
<b>Don't you know what that means?</b>

00:33:21.193 --> 00:33:23.239
<b>It means there will be one more guy.</b>

00:33:23.434 --> 00:33:25.239
<b>I hate that even more.</b>

00:33:25.294 --> 00:33:27.004
<b>Just keep me company.</b>

00:33:27.004 --> 00:33:28.838
<b>Ask someone else.</b>

00:33:29.604 --> 00:33:31.249
<b>I can't trust any other wenches.</b>

00:33:31.504 --> 00:33:33.474
<b>Is this really necessary?</b>

00:33:33.474 --> 00:33:35.218
<b>If you don't want to, then fine.</b>

00:33:35.244 --> 00:33:37.773
<b>But I'm going to drink everything he offers.</b>

00:33:37.773 --> 00:33:40.314
<b>But as you know, three glasses are my limit.</b>

00:33:40.314 --> 00:33:43.583
<b>Even if he takes me somewhere, I won't be able to say no.</b>

00:33:43.583 --> 00:33:46.512
<b>And I'll call you tomorrow morning in tears.</b>

00:33:46.513 --> 00:33:49.829
<b>"Seo Yeon, last night, he and I..."</b>

00:33:52.393 --> 00:33:54.639
<b>Where are you meeting again?</b>

00:33:55.424 --> 00:33:57.139
<b>I'll text you the address.</b>

00:34:01.463 --> 00:34:03.009
<b>Are you sure this is it?</b>

00:34:03.234 --> 00:34:05.648
<b>I searched this place up online, and it was quite pricey.</b>

00:34:06.374 --> 00:34:08.474
<b>How do I look? Do I look too dressed up?</b>

00:34:08.474 --> 00:34:09.504
<b>I need to look natural.</b>

00:34:09.504 --> 00:34:11.088
<b>You're pretty.</b>

00:34:12.213 --> 00:34:13.489
<b>One minute.</b>

00:34:13.843 --> 00:34:15.989
<b>This will suit you.</b>

00:34:16.713 --> 00:34:18.554
<b>I'm here as your bodyguard.</b>

00:34:18.554 --> 00:34:20.823
<b>It'd be wonderful if you hit it off with the other guy.</b>

00:34:20.823 --> 00:34:22.528
<b>Come on.</b>

00:34:23.554 --> 00:34:25.369
<b>- Good girl. - My gosh.</b>

00:34:25.994 --> 00:34:28.924
<b>Once you drink three glasses, we're leaving.</b>

00:34:28.924 --> 00:34:30.069
<b>Okay, okay.</b>

00:34:31.333 --> 00:34:32.533
<b>All right, I'm ready.</b>

00:34:32.533 --> 00:34:34.478
<b>Cover it. Cover it.</b>

00:34:39.333 --> 00:34:42.079
<b>Hey, it's been a long time.</b>

00:34:42.374 --> 00:34:43.989
<b>You're Kim Mi Kyung, and you're Joo Seo Yeon, right?</b>

00:34:44.414 --> 00:34:45.474
<b>You know me?</b>

00:34:45.474 --> 00:34:47.443
<b>Of course. We went to the same school.</b>

00:34:47.443 --> 00:34:48.658
<b>Sit down.</b>

00:34:53.823 --> 00:34:55.554
<b>Why didn't you call me after we last met?</b>

00:34:55.554 --> 00:34:57.124
<b>I was waiting for you. Why didn't you call me?</b>

00:34:57.124 --> 00:34:58.994
<b>You're a pro, aren't you?</b>

00:34:58.994 --> 00:35:01.124
<b>You answered my question with another question.</b>

00:35:01.124 --> 00:35:02.268
<b>Am I?</b>

00:35:02.794 --> 00:35:04.934
<b>I ordered what I like. Is that all right?</b>

00:35:04.934 --> 00:35:06.009
<b>Sure.</b>

00:35:07.864 --> 00:35:09.139
<b>Thanks.</b>

00:35:13.033 --> 00:35:14.674
<b>Why did you suddenly call me?</b>

00:35:14.674 --> 00:35:17.614
<b>I just remembered that I didn't show up for the alumni meeting.</b>

00:35:17.614 --> 00:35:19.343
<b>It was a bummer that I couldn't meet you that day,</b>

00:35:19.343 --> 00:35:20.588
<b>so I decided to call.</b>

00:35:20.814 --> 00:35:23.684
<b>Right, do you remember Kang Woo the Anus?</b>

00:35:23.684 --> 00:35:25.684
<b>- He was there. - What?</b>

00:35:25.684 --> 00:35:28.184
<b>That fat kid made a huge transformation.</b>

00:35:28.184 --> 00:35:30.228
<b>He became so good-looking.</b>

00:35:30.994 --> 00:35:32.199
<b>Really?</b>

00:35:32.893 --> 00:35:33.963
<b>What did the others say?</b>

00:35:33.963 --> 00:35:36.069
<b>They were all shocked.</b>

00:35:36.593 --> 00:35:38.294
<b>He looks like this one celebrity.</b>

00:35:38.294 --> 00:35:40.338
<b>He's a fraudster, I'm telling you.</b>

00:35:42.703 --> 00:35:45.304
<b>- A fraudster? - He suddenly came and was gone.</b>

00:35:45.304 --> 00:35:46.874
<b>I don't think he even chipped in.</b>

00:35:46.874 --> 00:35:48.518
<b>I didn't know I had to.</b>

00:35:49.343 --> 00:35:51.989
<b>Kang Woo? Why are you here?</b>

00:35:52.174 --> 00:35:54.689
<b>He and I kept in touch.</b>

00:35:56.914 --> 00:35:58.028
<b>We meet again.</b>

00:35:58.953 --> 00:36:00.754
<b>Right.</b>

00:36:00.754 --> 00:36:02.624
<b>I'm sorry I left so abruptly that night.</b>

00:36:02.624 --> 00:36:05.728
<b>Don't be. It's not like we promised to meet.</b>

00:36:07.294 --> 00:36:09.968
<b>By the way, were you unwell?</b>

00:36:13.263 --> 00:36:15.379
<b>Something urgent came up.</b>

00:36:16.903 --> 00:36:19.509
<b>But you took your time leaving.</b>

00:36:20.403 --> 00:36:22.049
<b>- It was like you had to poop... - Anyway,</b>

00:36:23.174 --> 00:36:24.619
<b>what have you two been up to?</b>

00:36:24.773 --> 00:36:26.749
<b>Try to guess.</b>

00:36:28.044 --> 00:36:31.013
<b>With your looks... A stewardess?</b>

00:36:31.013 --> 00:36:33.429
<b>Not bad. What about you guys?</b>

00:36:33.624 --> 00:36:35.128
<b>This and that.</b>

00:36:35.724 --> 00:36:37.569
<b>Only bad boys have a lot of secrets.</b>

00:36:39.923 --> 00:36:41.138
<b>Cheers.</b>

00:36:46.834 --> 00:36:48.878
<b>Do you have something to say?</b>

00:36:53.234 --> 00:36:55.319
<b>They seem to be having a good time.</b>

00:36:56.004 --> 00:36:57.588
<b>Should we drink elsewhere?</b>

00:36:59.513 --> 00:37:01.189
<b>You won't be able to say no.</b>

00:37:03.283 --> 00:37:05.358
<b>I don't know. Is that necessary?</b>

00:37:08.383 --> 00:37:09.458
<b>What?</b>

00:37:10.293 --> 00:37:11.399
<b>What is it?</b>

00:37:15.494 --> 00:37:17.039
<b>I'll be outside.</b>

00:37:17.933 --> 00:37:21.004
<b>Let's go home together.</b>

00:37:21.004 --> 00:37:23.708
<b>Oh, do you want to? Sure.</b>

00:37:26.033 --> 00:37:27.549
<b>I knew it.</b>

00:37:33.043 --> 00:37:34.844
<b>What's with his gaze?</b>

00:37:34.844 --> 00:37:36.883
<b>It's as if his eyes are glazed over.</b>

00:37:36.883 --> 00:37:40.254
<b>How do I look? Am I driving you crazy?</b>

00:37:40.254 --> 00:37:43.669
<b>What kind of face is that? His chin is as sharp as a knife.</b>

00:37:43.854 --> 00:37:45.399
<b>Is he a comb-pattern pottery?</b>

00:37:45.494 --> 00:37:46.754
<b>Why is it so sharp?</b>

00:37:46.754 --> 00:37:50.238
<b>Am I driving you crazy? Do you love me that much?</b>

00:37:51.464 --> 00:37:53.633
<b>Why are his limbs so long?</b>

00:37:53.633 --> 00:37:55.234
<b>And why is his head so small?</b>

00:37:55.234 --> 00:37:57.279
<b>He's the worst.</b>

00:37:57.334 --> 00:37:59.549
<b>I'm sure I'm all that you're thinking about.</b>

00:37:59.633 --> 00:38:02.049
<b>No matter what you do, you won't be able to erase me.</b>

00:38:02.504 --> 00:38:04.618
<b>You're done for.</b>

00:38:21.263 --> 00:38:22.793
<b>What do you do?</b>

00:38:22.793 --> 00:38:25.663
<b>I'm just doing stuff.</b>

00:38:25.663 --> 00:38:27.939
<b>Are you seeing anyone?</b>

00:38:29.633 --> 00:38:31.108
<b>Why do you ask?</b>

00:38:31.403 --> 00:38:34.419
<b>I'm interested in you.</b>

00:38:36.374 --> 00:38:39.043
<b>- What? - That's why I asked Hyun Soo...</b>

00:38:39.043 --> 00:38:40.758
<b>to hook us up.</b>

00:38:41.913 --> 00:38:43.344
<b>It wasn't because of Mi Kyung?</b>

00:38:43.344 --> 00:38:45.789
<b>Like you said, you're my first love.</b>

00:38:46.454 --> 00:38:49.529
<b>But you rejected me back then.</b>

00:38:49.954 --> 00:38:51.098
<b>That's because...</b>

00:38:52.523 --> 00:38:53.968
<b>Let me talk first.</b>

00:39:00.663 --> 00:39:02.579
<b>Thanks to your rejection,</b>

00:39:03.263 --> 00:39:04.909
<b>I woke up and smelled the coffee.</b>

00:39:05.074 --> 00:39:07.718
<b>I was determined to become the best man for you.</b>

00:39:08.643 --> 00:39:12.449
<b>However, it took me 15 years.</b>

00:39:13.844 --> 00:39:14.958
<b>What do you say?</b>

00:39:15.643 --> 00:39:19.189
<b>Will you accept me this time?</b>

00:39:20.683 --> 00:39:21.829
<b>Seo Yeon,</b>

00:39:22.523 --> 00:39:23.799
<b>will you go out with me?</b>

00:39:27.694 --> 00:39:28.769
<b>Are you...</b>

00:39:30.364 --> 00:39:31.968
<b>unwell?</b>

00:39:33.393 --> 00:39:35.334
<b>- What? - Were you in the States...</b>

00:39:35.334 --> 00:39:37.834
<b>for the past 15 years, receiving treatment?</b>

00:39:37.834 --> 00:39:38.909
<b>What?</b>

00:39:39.704 --> 00:39:42.204
<b>If not, what kind of lunatic...</b>

00:39:42.204 --> 00:39:44.689
<b>asks a girl out when he barely even knows her?</b>

00:39:44.744 --> 00:39:46.043
<b>"Lunatic"?</b>

00:39:46.043 --> 00:39:49.689
<b>Hey, cut this nonsense and go poop!</b>

00:39:50.244 --> 00:39:53.214
<b>"Poop"? Hey! Why would I poop?</b>

00:39:53.214 --> 00:39:55.153
<b>What have you done to help me poop?</b>

00:39:55.153 --> 00:39:57.324
<b>What's it to you whether I poop or not?</b>

00:39:57.324 --> 00:40:00.769
<b>That has nothing to do with you! I don't even want to poop right now!</b>

00:40:10.974 --> 00:40:12.108
<b>My stomach...</b>

00:40:14.403 --> 00:40:16.549
<b>Darn it.</b>

00:40:26.354 --> 00:40:30.153
<b>What? What is it? What's wrong with you?</b>

00:40:30.153 --> 00:40:33.723
<b>Don't you ever meet them or pick up their calls again.</b>

00:40:33.724 --> 00:40:34.868
<b>Why not?</b>

00:40:35.124 --> 00:40:36.893
<b>Do you know what Kang Woo did?</b>

00:40:36.893 --> 00:40:39.464
<b>- He asked me out. - What?</b>

00:40:39.464 --> 00:40:42.208
<b>What does he take me for that he says something like that?</b>

00:40:42.234 --> 00:40:43.878
<b>Did Hyun Soo not say anything?</b>

00:40:44.504 --> 00:40:45.574
<b>Not really.</b>

00:40:45.574 --> 00:40:48.549
<b>But he never told me what he did for a living.</b>

00:40:48.673 --> 00:40:50.478
<b>He kept dodging the question.</b>

00:40:50.574 --> 00:40:51.944
<b>So I didn't tell him either.</b>

00:40:51.944 --> 00:40:55.519
<b>See? They're both weird. They must have gone insane.</b>

00:40:55.584 --> 00:40:58.053
<b>I didn't like the way they looked,</b>

00:40:58.053 --> 00:40:59.584
<b>and look what happened.</b>

00:40:59.584 --> 00:41:02.128
<b>I was relieved to meet some decent guys.</b>

00:41:02.224 --> 00:41:05.053
<b>Forget it. Let's have some rice soup.</b>

00:41:05.053 --> 00:41:06.128
<b>Deal.</b>

00:41:10.263 --> 00:41:14.133
<b>Hey, what kind of guy asks a woman out all of a sudden?</b>

00:41:14.133 --> 00:41:15.964
<b>When it comes to women, you're so straightforward.</b>

00:41:15.964 --> 00:41:18.903
<b>What is it? What do I lack?</b>

00:41:18.903 --> 00:41:21.474
<b>She should've been grateful that I asked her out.</b>

00:41:21.474 --> 00:41:23.819
<b>But what? "Go poop"?</b>

00:41:25.413 --> 00:41:27.149
<b>That is strange.</b>

00:41:27.643 --> 00:41:30.913
<b>It's not easy for women to say no to your face.</b>

00:41:30.913 --> 00:41:32.754
<b>Worst-case scenario,</b>

00:41:32.754 --> 00:41:35.254
<b>they'd say that they'd think about it.</b>

00:41:35.254 --> 00:41:36.458
<b>Seo Yeon.</b>

00:41:36.923 --> 00:41:39.329
<b>I guess I'm still lacking in your eyes.</b>

00:41:39.423 --> 00:41:41.824
<b>But how? What else do I need?</b>

00:41:41.824 --> 00:41:42.994
<b>I'm perfect.</b>

00:41:42.994 --> 00:41:44.968
<b>Look at my face and my body.</b>

00:41:46.864 --> 00:41:48.079
<b>Right. It's that.</b>

00:41:50.974 --> 00:41:52.049
<b>It's your wealth.</b>

00:41:53.204 --> 00:41:55.149
<b>- What? - Money.</b>

00:41:55.604 --> 00:41:58.944
<b>Kim Mi Kyung told me that you didn't drive to the reunion.</b>

00:41:58.944 --> 00:42:01.413
<b>She asked why you didn't have a car when you looked rich.</b>

00:42:01.413 --> 00:42:04.728
<b>Goodness. I thought that was so absurd.</b>

00:42:04.954 --> 00:42:07.383
<b>You know that people judge other's wealth based on cars.</b>

00:42:07.383 --> 00:42:09.254
<b>You can't leave Korea for the time being because of your Grandma.</b>

00:42:09.254 --> 00:42:11.029
<b>Go and buy yourself a car tomorrow.</b>

00:42:11.854 --> 00:42:12.929
<b>A car?</b>

00:42:13.224 --> 00:42:16.523
<b>Yes. Get a really nice car and ask her out again.</b>

00:42:16.523 --> 00:42:19.533
<b>Show her that you have money and good looks.</b>

00:42:19.533 --> 00:42:22.063
<b>Lie and tell her that the only person who can...</b>

00:42:22.063 --> 00:42:23.738
<b>fill your empty heart is her.</b>

00:42:24.004 --> 00:42:25.504
<b>- Okay. - Buy her a delicious meal.</b>

00:42:25.504 --> 00:42:26.574
<b>And buy her nice things.</b>

00:42:26.574 --> 00:42:28.504
<b>Make her go crazy for you.</b>

00:42:28.504 --> 00:42:29.773
<b>After that...</b>

00:42:29.773 --> 00:42:31.019
<b>After that?</b>

00:42:31.643 --> 00:42:33.474
<b>When she looks the happiest...</b>

00:42:33.474 --> 00:42:37.559
<b>and she's head over heels for you, that's when...</b>

00:42:39.614 --> 00:42:41.329
<b>you should dump her.</b>

00:42:42.653 --> 00:42:44.468
<b>The game is over then.</b>

00:42:48.063 --> 00:42:49.838
<b>Game over.</b>

00:42:56.504 --> 00:42:57.748
<b>I'm home.</b>

00:43:01.474 --> 00:43:02.618
<b>What?</b>

00:43:03.173 --> 00:43:04.789
<b>Darn it. No one is home again?</b>

00:43:04.944 --> 00:43:06.348
<b>Darn it.</b>

00:43:10.114 --> 00:43:12.088
<b>I can't believe them.</b>

00:43:13.383 --> 00:43:15.728
<b>Darn it. They know I hate this.</b>

00:43:26.234 --> 00:43:28.104
<b>How could the house always be empty until late night...</b>

00:43:28.104 --> 00:43:29.704
<b>when there's a minor living in this house?</b>

00:43:29.704 --> 00:43:31.378
<b>Darn it!</b>

00:43:38.874 --> 00:43:41.543
<b>This happened on the first day...</b>

00:43:41.543 --> 00:43:44.128
<b>of moving into a new studio.</b>

00:43:45.683 --> 00:43:47.758
<b>I was washing my hair in the bathroom.</b>

00:43:47.954 --> 00:43:50.258
<b>And I looked at the mirror.</b>

00:43:51.224 --> 00:43:54.069
<b>And I saw a woman in the mirror.</b>

00:43:55.364 --> 00:43:57.439
<b>Her back was hunched,</b>

00:43:57.864 --> 00:44:02.008
<b>and she was staring at me through the mirror...</b>

00:44:02.464 --> 00:44:04.909
<b>as if I was having sleep paralysis...</b>

00:44:10.173 --> 00:44:11.374
<b>That's all made-up.</b>

00:44:11.374 --> 00:44:13.649
<b>It's all made-up. My goodness.</b>

00:44:15.114 --> 00:44:16.258
<b>Go away.</b>

00:44:16.344 --> 00:44:18.059
<b>Go away!</b>

00:44:19.454 --> 00:44:20.858
<b>I hate this.</b>

00:44:37.903 --> 00:44:39.279
<b>Are you home, Seo Yeon?</b>

00:44:43.504 --> 00:44:44.588
<b>Seo Yeon.</b>

00:44:48.844 --> 00:44:51.059
<b>Won Jae? Is that you, Won Seok?</b>

00:45:01.824 --> 00:45:02.998
<b>Seo Yeon?</b>

00:45:17.043 --> 00:45:18.118
<b>Hey.</b>

00:45:23.214 --> 00:45:24.289
<b>Are you all right?</b>

00:45:28.553 --> 00:45:31.553
<b>Imagine if people at our school found out we live in the same house.</b>

00:45:31.553 --> 00:45:33.323
<b>You know that idol stars can lose their fame...</b>

00:45:33.323 --> 00:45:35.023
<b>with just one scandal, right?</b>

00:45:35.023 --> 00:45:36.694
<b>If you hate it that much,</b>

00:45:36.694 --> 00:45:38.333
<b>I'll talk to Ms. Joo and leave.</b>

00:45:38.333 --> 00:45:40.668
<b>Sure. Yes. You should.</b>

00:45:49.174 --> 00:45:51.819
<b>I won't leave the room. So you don't need to be uncomfortable.</b>

00:45:56.783 --> 00:45:59.559
<b>Why would I feel uncomfortable?</b>

00:46:00.484 --> 00:46:02.158
<b>Gosh, this is annoying.</b>

00:46:07.924 --> 00:46:09.938
<b>That's new. He's sleeping alone.</b>

00:46:10.793 --> 00:46:13.108
<b>Did he feel safe because Joo Hee is home?</b>

00:46:18.109 --> 00:46:23.109


00:46:27.073 --> 00:46:28.358
<b>Seo Yeon!</b>

00:46:28.583 --> 00:46:29.888
<b>I've decided.</b>

00:46:30.043 --> 00:46:31.414
<b>Joo Hee will stay here.</b>

00:46:31.414 --> 00:46:32.489
<b>Won Jae.</b>

00:46:32.613 --> 00:46:34.484
<b>I heard about her story. She's having a hard time now.</b>

00:46:34.484 --> 00:46:35.928
<b>You should yield this time.</b>

00:46:36.083 --> 00:46:37.154
<b>Won Seok.</b>

00:46:37.154 --> 00:46:38.724
<b>Can I go back to my room and sleep?</b>

00:46:38.724 --> 00:46:40.694
<b>Come on, guys.</b>

00:46:40.694 --> 00:46:43.368
<b>- Let's go. - Come on.</b>

00:46:45.664 --> 00:46:48.539
<b>You all have to wire me money for the living expense by lunchtime.</b>

00:46:50.033 --> 00:46:53.704
<b>Darn it. Seo Yeon! What if people find out?</b>

00:46:53.704 --> 00:46:55.744
<b>There are other people living in this house too.</b>

00:46:55.744 --> 00:46:57.302
<b>Stop making a big deal out of this.</b>

00:46:57.303 --> 00:47:00.618
<b>Besides, you slept fine without us yesterday.</b>

00:47:01.043 --> 00:47:02.313
<b>Well...</b>

00:47:02.313 --> 00:47:03.444
<b>You slept fine...</b>

00:47:03.444 --> 00:47:05.353
<b>because your subconscious knew Joo Hee was home.</b>

00:47:05.353 --> 00:47:08.053
<b>See? She's already helpful.</b>

00:47:08.053 --> 00:47:09.484
<b>Stop whining.</b>

00:47:09.484 --> 00:47:10.858
<b>And get ready for school.</b>

00:47:11.023 --> 00:47:12.229
<b>Okay?</b>

00:47:13.323 --> 00:47:16.194
<b>Darn it. Come on.</b>

00:47:16.194 --> 00:47:19.509
<b>Why are you doing this to me? Why?</b>

00:47:25.833 --> 00:47:29.678
<b>You. I'll just think of you as a dog.</b>

00:47:29.773 --> 00:47:32.789
<b>You're a dog who guards the house. No more, no less.</b>

00:47:34.214 --> 00:47:36.214
<b>Don't pretend to know me at school.</b>

00:47:36.214 --> 00:47:38.754
<b>Don't you dare think about taking photos and sell them.</b>

00:47:38.754 --> 00:47:39.928
<b>Got that?</b>

00:47:42.654 --> 00:47:44.469
<b>Gosh. What a lunatic.</b>

00:47:46.254 --> 00:47:47.523
<b>I only see vegetables.</b>

00:47:47.523 --> 00:47:48.863
<b>- I'll give you mine. - Eat mine.</b>

00:47:48.863 --> 00:47:50.194
<b>- I'm allergic to plums. - Hey.</b>

00:47:50.194 --> 00:47:51.234
<b>- It's all right. - You are?</b>

00:47:51.234 --> 00:47:52.438
<b>- Yes. - I don't like plumps.</b>

00:47:53.464 --> 00:47:54.638
<b>I'll give you mine.</b>

00:47:55.234 --> 00:47:57.533
<b>- What's wrong? - Water. Give him some water.</b>

00:47:57.533 --> 00:47:59.434
<b>Let's eat somewhere else.</b>

00:47:59.434 --> 00:48:01.343
<b>- Why? - What's wrong?</b>

00:48:01.343 --> 00:48:03.144
<b>- Are you all right? - What's wrong?</b>

00:48:03.144 --> 00:48:04.644
<b>I don't know. Let's just eat somewhere else.</b>

00:48:04.644 --> 00:48:06.148
<b>- What's the matter with him? - Where are you going?</b>

00:48:08.283 --> 00:48:10.088
<b>He's the one making it obvious.</b>

00:48:13.783 --> 00:48:16.029
<b>I told them to wire me the money.</b>

00:48:16.224 --> 00:48:18.229
<b>So they didn't listen to me.</b>

00:48:18.793 --> 00:48:19.969
<b>Fine.</b>

00:48:20.654 --> 00:48:22.698
<b>I'll go and get it myself.</b>

00:48:53.623 --> 00:48:54.898
<b>The view here is nice.</b>

00:49:14.744 --> 00:49:16.559
<b>Do you need anything?</b>

00:49:17.313 --> 00:49:18.459
<b>This is confusing.</b>

00:49:18.914 --> 00:49:19.989
<b>Pardon?</b>

00:49:21.123 --> 00:49:22.658
<b>I can't figure you out.</b>

00:49:23.454 --> 00:49:24.694
<b>What do you mean?</b>

00:49:24.694 --> 00:49:27.269
<b>Why did you tell on Seo Yeon?</b>

00:49:28.323 --> 00:49:30.969
<b>I saw her breaking the flowerpot.</b>

00:49:31.234 --> 00:49:34.309
<b>That wasn't what I was asking.</b>

00:49:38.504 --> 00:49:40.809
<b>Mr. Lee. Do you...</b>

00:49:41.343 --> 00:49:44.618
<b>like...</b>

00:49:56.123 --> 00:49:57.198
<b>Never mind.</b>

00:49:57.384 --> 00:49:59.823
<b>Whatever it is, you're more handsome up close...</b>

00:49:59.823 --> 00:50:01.338
<b>which is why it's more disappointing.</b>

00:50:01.523 --> 00:50:02.668
<b>Have a good day.</b>

00:50:17.543 --> 00:50:20.343
<b>So if you're going to be close friends with them,</b>

00:50:20.343 --> 00:50:22.343
<b>don't tell them which family you're from.</b>

00:50:22.343 --> 00:50:24.688
<b>I never tell them what I do.</b>

00:50:25.254 --> 00:50:26.329
<b>Why not?</b>

00:50:26.754 --> 00:50:29.283
<b>It's a hassle when people find out what I do.</b>

00:50:29.283 --> 00:50:30.729
<b>Just give them vague answers.</b>

00:50:36.164 --> 00:50:37.239
<b>Hey.</b>

00:50:38.363 --> 00:50:39.709
<b>Isn't that Joo Seo Yeon?</b>

00:50:42.063 --> 00:50:44.378
<b>Why did you wear your pajamas to visit me at work?</b>

00:50:47.603 --> 00:50:49.479
<b>My gosh, is that her boyfriend?</b>

00:50:49.773 --> 00:50:50.944
<b>He's really handsome.</b>

00:50:50.944 --> 00:50:53.588
<b>- Why... - Why do you think I'm here?</b>

00:50:54.613 --> 00:50:56.259
<b>Let's talk about this at home.</b>

00:51:01.484 --> 00:51:03.158
<b>- More than me? - What?</b>

00:51:03.754 --> 00:51:05.769
<b>Is he more handsome than me?</b>

00:51:08.823 --> 00:51:11.533
<b>My gosh, no.</b>

00:51:11.533 --> 00:51:13.309
<b>He's a different kind of handsome.</b>

00:51:13.763 --> 00:51:16.103
<b>I get why she didn't fall for your looks.</b>

00:51:16.103 --> 00:51:18.348
<b>It's because she has a handsome boyfriend like him.</b>

00:51:23.773 --> 00:51:26.348
<b>Where are you going? You're not going to buy a car?</b>

00:51:26.674 --> 00:51:28.019
<b>Will you walk?</b>

00:51:28.184 --> 00:51:29.984
<b>(Easy Transfer, 500 dollars)</b>

00:51:29.984 --> 00:51:31.059
<b>You're persistent.</b>

00:51:31.654 --> 00:51:34.454
<b>It could've been better had you wired me the money on time.</b>

00:51:34.454 --> 00:51:36.858
<b>You always make me come all the way here for this.</b>

00:51:37.283 --> 00:51:38.898
<b>There. Happy now?</b>

00:51:40.623 --> 00:51:42.668
<b>Then I'll see you again next month.</b>

00:51:49.634 --> 00:51:51.704
<b>Is she really your sister?</b>

00:51:51.704 --> 00:51:53.073
<b>Yes. Why?</b>

00:51:53.073 --> 00:51:55.579
<b>You two look nothing alike.</b>

00:51:55.904 --> 00:51:57.073
<b>Is she really your biological sister?</b>

00:51:57.073 --> 00:51:59.749
<b>Of course, we look alike!</b>

00:51:59.813 --> 00:52:01.148
<b>We look exactly the same.</b>

00:52:05.013 --> 00:52:06.759
<b>How can she date someone like him?</b>

00:52:07.583 --> 00:52:08.729
<b>What's her secret?</b>

00:52:09.353 --> 00:52:11.654
<b>She must be amazingly charming in a way that we don't know.</b>

00:52:11.654 --> 00:52:14.569
<b>Charming? Seo Yeon? No way.</b>

00:52:15.763 --> 00:52:17.724
<b>I'm sure that man is just playing with her.</b>

00:52:17.724 --> 00:52:19.194
<b>Like what you're about to do?</b>

00:52:19.194 --> 00:52:20.408
<b>Hey, that's...</b>

00:52:21.093 --> 00:52:23.434
<b>- Yes? - Mr. Park! It's Seok Min.</b>

00:52:23.434 --> 00:52:24.779
<b>What about him?</b>

00:52:26.704 --> 00:52:27.779
<b>What?</b>

00:52:29.174 --> 00:52:30.579
<b>Darn it, that idiot.</b>

00:52:31.103 --> 00:52:32.219
<b>Okay.</b>

00:52:33.644 --> 00:52:34.719
<b>What is it?</b>

00:52:35.043 --> 00:52:37.384
<b>I told him to be careful for a while.</b>

00:52:37.384 --> 00:52:39.388
<b>Why couldn't he hold himself back?</b>

00:52:48.724 --> 00:52:51.408
<b>Stay here. I have to see if someone's there.</b>

00:52:53.134 --> 00:52:54.269
<b>I...</b>

00:53:00.174 --> 00:53:01.378
<b>What's going on?</b>

00:53:02.373 --> 00:53:04.319
<b>Why do guys who look like that walk in there?</b>

00:53:23.964 --> 00:53:27.194
<b>See that? Even guys look at me like this.</b>

00:53:27.194 --> 00:53:29.338
<b>Seo Yeon, how dare you look down on me?</b>

00:53:31.573 --> 00:53:34.108
<b>Goodness, where is Hyun Soo anyway?</b>

00:53:41.343 --> 00:53:44.583
<b>Hey, if you don't send it to me right now,</b>

00:53:44.583 --> 00:53:47.959
<b>I will make a huge scene right here.</b>

00:53:52.553 --> 00:53:53.898
<b>I'll send it right now.</b>

00:53:56.664 --> 00:53:57.969
<b>No way.</b>

00:53:58.093 --> 00:54:00.539
<b>My gosh. I told you to wait in the car.</b>

00:54:02.934 --> 00:54:04.009
<b>Hey.</b>

00:54:05.704 --> 00:54:06.809
<b>What's wrong?</b>

00:54:09.273 --> 00:54:10.979
<b>Do you need to poop again?</b>

00:54:11.414 --> 00:54:12.549
<b>Go.</b>

00:54:18.813 --> 00:54:21.188
<b>Did you poop? Did you poop again?</b>

00:54:21.724 --> 00:54:22.829
<b>No, right?</b>

00:54:22.954 --> 00:54:24.898
<b>Tell me that you didn't.</b>

00:54:25.424 --> 00:54:27.424
<b>It's okay, man. It's okay.</b>

00:54:27.424 --> 00:54:29.938
<b>Let's go. Let's go home.</b>

00:54:33.894 --> 00:54:36.579
<b>Hold it in. Please hold it in.</b>

00:54:42.603 --> 00:54:44.049
<b>What's with them?</b>

00:54:45.573 --> 00:54:47.088
<b>If they're in a relationship...</b>

00:54:50.984 --> 00:54:52.088
<b>Goodness.</b>

00:55:05.093 --> 00:55:07.769
<b>How can Seo Yeon date men like them?</b>

00:55:08.763 --> 00:55:09.838
<b>But wait.</b>

00:55:10.404 --> 00:55:12.779
<b>If she can date them, why can't she date me?</b>

00:55:18.174 --> 00:55:19.888
<b>Why?</b>

00:55:26.813 --> 00:55:29.754
<b>What? They were at Won Seok's bar together?</b>

00:55:29.754 --> 00:55:32.628
<b>And it looked like they were in a deep relationship.</b>

00:55:32.654 --> 00:55:35.093
<b>Then does this mean they were playing with us?</b>

00:55:35.093 --> 00:55:37.838
<b>I told you that you can't trust good looking guys.</b>

00:55:37.863 --> 00:55:39.763
<b>If I ever see them again,</b>

00:55:39.763 --> 00:55:41.838
<b>I'll break both of them in half.</b>

00:55:42.603 --> 00:55:43.678
<b>Hey.</b>

00:55:44.333 --> 00:55:45.608
<b>Why?</b>

00:55:50.444 --> 00:55:51.549
<b>Excuse me.</b>

00:55:56.714 --> 00:55:57.789
<b>Hey.</b>

00:55:58.414 --> 00:55:59.628
<b>It's you, the teacher.</b>

00:55:59.884 --> 00:56:04.023
<b>Do you not have a place to stay?</b>

00:56:04.023 --> 00:56:05.093
<b>What?</b>

00:56:05.093 --> 00:56:07.994
<b>If you can contact someone by the phone, I can call them.</b>

00:56:07.994 --> 00:56:09.224
<b>Or you can go to a shelter...</b>

00:56:09.224 --> 00:56:10.499
<b>I'm fine.</b>

00:56:13.934 --> 00:56:16.039
<b>Are you sure?</b>

00:56:17.063 --> 00:56:18.309
<b>You're so kind.</b>

00:56:21.974 --> 00:56:23.118
<b>Do you want this?</b>

00:56:23.674 --> 00:56:25.613
<b>What? No, it's okay.</b>

00:56:25.613 --> 00:56:27.019
<b>You can keep it.</b>

00:56:29.144 --> 00:56:33.088
<b>By any chance, if you ever need any help...</b>

00:56:36.984 --> 00:56:38.098
<b>Hey.</b>

00:56:38.924 --> 00:56:41.269
<b>What's with you? My gosh.</b>

00:56:56.474 --> 00:57:00.289
<b>If you need any help, give me a call.</b>

00:57:10.323 --> 00:57:11.598
<b>What's your name?</b>

00:57:12.093 --> 00:57:13.168
<b>Me?</b>

00:57:14.093 --> 00:57:15.338
<b>I'm Joo Seo Yeon.</b>

00:57:15.623 --> 00:57:16.938
<b>I'm Baek Jang Mi.</b>

00:57:18.694 --> 00:57:20.209
<b>Okay, then.</b>

00:57:28.004 --> 00:57:29.148
<b>Who was that?</b>

00:57:29.504 --> 00:57:31.648
<b>I think she's homeless.</b>

00:57:31.674 --> 00:57:32.989
<b>But she's so young.</b>

00:57:33.573 --> 00:57:35.418
<b>I'm sure she has a story.</b>

00:57:36.214 --> 00:57:37.658
<b>Did she say her name is Baek Jang Mi?</b>

00:57:37.744 --> 00:57:41.188
<b>That's a name for the worst psychotic girls you see in dramas.</b>

00:57:54.533 --> 00:57:55.739
<b>Joo Seo Yeon.</b>

00:58:19.023 --> 00:58:20.654
<b>I really don't like him.</b>

00:58:20.654 --> 00:58:23.138
<b>How can he keep his shape after eating like that?</b>

00:58:23.964 --> 00:58:25.108
<b>Hey.</b>

00:58:26.793 --> 00:58:28.434
<b>What brings you here?</b>

00:58:28.434 --> 00:58:30.309
<b>Me? Well.</b>

00:58:31.974 --> 00:58:34.049
<b>I wanted to see you, and some other things.</b>

00:58:35.873 --> 00:58:37.744
<b>You had such a great career in that huge hospital.</b>

00:58:37.744 --> 00:58:40.489
<b>Isn't it too suffocating to sit in this tiny room?</b>

00:58:40.714 --> 00:58:42.358
<b>It's not as tiny as you think.</b>

00:58:42.984 --> 00:58:44.618
<b>Is it easy to work at a school?</b>

00:58:45.384 --> 00:58:47.214
<b>You can come and go at a certain time,</b>

00:58:47.214 --> 00:58:49.398
<b>and you get vacations. It's not that bad.</b>

00:58:50.654 --> 00:58:53.194
<b>So it's good, right?</b>

00:58:53.194 --> 00:58:54.299
<b>Why?</b>

00:58:55.464 --> 00:58:56.999
<b>Is our school on the list too?</b>

00:58:57.494 --> 00:59:00.763
<b>Something like that. But I hate kids.</b>

00:59:00.763 --> 00:59:02.239
<b>So I can't come...</b>

00:59:08.004 --> 00:59:09.079
<b>What is this?</b>

00:59:09.904 --> 00:59:11.249
<b>Why is she here?</b>

00:59:33.363 --> 00:59:35.079
<b>I found out that...</b>

00:59:36.033 --> 00:59:38.209
<b>she is sitting in my palm.</b>

00:59:39.134 --> 00:59:43.042
<b>I could just clench my fist lightly.</b>

00:59:43.043 --> 00:59:45.188
<b>I didn't know I could overcome it this easily.</b>

00:59:49.113 --> 00:59:50.289
<b>What do you mean?</b>

00:59:51.543 --> 00:59:54.829
<b>I want to get my revenge instead of overcoming her.</b>

00:59:58.994 --> 01:00:00.923
<b>Everyone, I need your attention.</b>

01:00:00.924 --> 01:00:05.134
<b>We finally have a new chief director...</b>

01:00:05.134 --> 01:00:06.938
<b>whom we did not have until today.</b>

01:00:07.593 --> 01:00:11.803
<b>He's a very competent man who studied at Stanford,</b>

01:00:11.803 --> 01:00:13.648
<b>a renowned university.</b>

01:00:13.833 --> 01:00:17.404
<b>Please welcome him with a big hand.</b>

01:00:17.404 --> 01:00:18.519
<b>Chief Director?</b>

01:00:36.623 --> 01:00:38.069
<b>Nice to meet you.</b>

01:00:39.063 --> 01:00:42.309
<b>I'm Lee Kang Woo, your chief director.</b>

01:00:42.464 --> 01:00:43.878
<b>Please welcome him!</b>

01:00:49.773 --> 01:00:51.148
<b>Darn it.</b>

01:01:06.894 --> 01:01:09.668
<b>I'll kill you.</b>

01:01:52.333 --> 01:01:54.234
<b>(Love with Flaws)</b>

01:01:54.234 --> 01:01:55.504
<b>I don't care if he's the chief director!</b>

01:01:55.504 --> 01:01:56.773
<b>I don't care if he's the successor!</b>

01:01:56.773 --> 01:01:59.343
<b>That means Anus will determine your future.</b>

01:01:59.343 --> 01:02:00.414
<b>We have a track team, don't we?</b>

01:02:00.414 --> 01:02:02.513
<b>If they don't show any performance, we don't have to leave it.</b>

01:02:02.513 --> 01:02:04.384
<b>You don't want people to know that you're a part of the foundation?</b>

01:02:04.384 --> 01:02:06.984
<b>- Ladies, do you want a ride? - My gosh!</b>

01:02:06.984 --> 01:02:07.984
<b>You idiot!</b>

01:02:07.984 --> 01:02:09.154
<b>Who's that? Where's the agency?</b>

01:02:09.154 --> 01:02:11.254
<b>Shinhwa Food? That's why she was arrogant.</b>

01:02:11.254 --> 01:02:13.293
<b>Don't get so clingy over something that happened...</b>

01:02:13.293 --> 01:02:15.223
<b>- ages ago! - Clingy?</b>

01:02:15.223 --> 01:02:17.169
<b>You're still the same, Seo Yeon.</b>

01:02:17.364 --> 01:02:18.764
<b>You judge guys by their looks.</b>

01:02:18.764 --> 01:02:19.839
<b>What?</b>
