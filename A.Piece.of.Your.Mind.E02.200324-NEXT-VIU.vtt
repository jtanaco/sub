00:00:09.317 --> 00:00:11.426
You can't see him?

00:00:11.426 --> 00:00:12.902
No, never.

00:00:18.667 --> 00:00:22.212
I only want a small piece of her.

00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:27.151
It was nothing.

00:00:28.137 --> 00:00:30.751
I haven't met him before,

00:00:32.347 --> 00:00:35.821
but he burrowed into my heart.

00:01:00.336 --> 00:01:01.482
(Kim Ji Soo)

00:01:08.847 --> 00:01:10.592
(Kim Ji Soo)

00:01:14.457 --> 00:01:16.032
Why did you do it?

00:01:16.987 --> 00:01:18.402
I'm sorry.

00:01:18.457 --> 00:01:21.926
You two were old friends, so...

00:01:21.926 --> 00:01:23.331
Friends...

00:01:25.097 --> 00:01:26.896
What do you know?

00:01:26.896 --> 00:01:28.336
I just...

00:01:28.336 --> 00:01:29.767
Did Ha Won ask you?

00:01:29.767 --> 00:01:32.911
I don't know him. I really don't know him.

00:01:33.237 --> 00:01:34.652
I just...

00:01:35.536 --> 00:01:38.207
wanted to do something for you.

00:01:38.207 --> 00:01:41.491
Do you know what the last thing he said to me was?

00:01:44.317 --> 00:01:46.392
"Call me when you become miserable."

00:01:48.457 --> 00:01:50.161
I became miserable,

00:01:50.526 --> 00:01:52.331
but I didn't call him.

00:01:53.086 --> 00:01:55.896
I won't. I will never. Do you know why?

00:01:55.896 --> 00:01:57.142
Because...

00:02:32.397 --> 00:02:33.912
(Episode 2)

00:02:38.036 --> 00:02:39.111
(77-30 Wokin 4-gil)

00:02:55.717 --> 00:02:56.886
(Before Dawn, They didn't meet)

00:02:56.886 --> 00:03:00.602
Before Dawn. They didn't meet.

00:03:01.427 --> 00:03:03.726
I think it's for the best, actually.

00:03:03.726 --> 00:03:07.942
I shouldn't have done anything.

00:03:14.136 --> 00:03:16.281
How did they...

00:03:41.837 --> 00:03:43.472
(External Input)

00:03:47.736 --> 00:03:51.722
This is the final boarding call for Lee Han Sol...

00:03:52.506 --> 00:03:54.347
booked on flight to...

00:03:54.347 --> 00:03:55.416
Excuse me.

00:03:55.416 --> 00:03:58.546
Please proceed to gate 10...

00:03:58.546 --> 00:04:00.692
on the third floor immediately.

00:04:08.557 --> 00:04:09.632
Hello?

00:04:10.497 --> 00:04:11.742
Where are you again?

00:04:12.766 --> 00:04:14.142
I'm in...

00:04:15.096 --> 00:04:17.072
Wokin-dong, Jongno-gu.

00:05:17.026 --> 00:05:18.271
It's Ha Won.

00:05:32.506 --> 00:05:34.791
Is this the place?

00:05:35.716 --> 00:05:36.822
Yes.

00:05:37.687 --> 00:05:38.822
What is this place?

00:05:39.117 --> 00:05:40.716
When we were on the phone,

00:05:40.716 --> 00:05:43.031
its address captured my attention.

00:05:44.727 --> 00:05:46.461
Doesn't it feel so warm?

00:05:47.057 --> 00:05:48.372
It's a typical Korean house.

00:05:49.797 --> 00:05:51.471
How long were you in Seoul?

00:05:52.196 --> 00:05:53.372
I wasn't.

00:05:56.997 --> 00:05:58.242
Where are you coming from?

00:05:59.466 --> 00:06:01.512
- College. - From the States?

00:06:01.576 --> 00:06:04.382
You wanted to see me, so I left in the middle of a lecture.

00:06:15.016 --> 00:06:17.031
I guess you have something important to tell me.

00:06:17.557 --> 00:06:19.101
Let's take some time to breathe before then.

00:06:19.886 --> 00:06:21.096
I'm okay now.

00:06:21.096 --> 00:06:23.357
Let's still do it. Otherwise, your mom will give me a scolding.

00:06:23.357 --> 00:06:24.572
I said I'm okay.

00:06:25.466 --> 00:06:27.202
I know a park here. Let's go.

00:06:36.206 --> 00:06:38.151
Your mom always said...

00:06:39.076 --> 00:06:41.216
that you shouldn't live in Seoul...

00:06:41.216 --> 00:06:43.091
because you'd get rashes all over your body.

00:06:43.817 --> 00:06:45.622
That you should live around trees.

00:06:46.516 --> 00:06:49.461
That was just briefly when I was a kid. I'm fine now.

00:06:54.227 --> 00:06:56.531
Tell me. What did you want to tell me?

00:06:58.196 --> 00:06:59.642
Not yet.

00:07:00.367 --> 00:07:02.596
You and I always wondered...

00:07:02.596 --> 00:07:04.781
what Korea was like.

00:07:05.636 --> 00:07:09.252
We could only imagine it before, but we're here together now.

00:07:10.107 --> 00:07:11.322
Let's take it slow.

00:07:13.747 --> 00:07:14.952
Do you have enough time?

00:07:15.817 --> 00:07:16.921
Yes.

00:07:18.016 --> 00:07:20.392
- Should we go to that place? - Is there a place you want to go?

00:07:21.357 --> 00:07:22.791
Where you wanted to go.

00:07:24.557 --> 00:07:25.632
Me?

00:07:29.557 --> 00:07:33.072
A single leaf Lands on the shoulder

00:07:34.367 --> 00:07:37.012
Without making a sound

00:07:38.307 --> 00:07:41.812
Cosmos laid its hand on me

00:07:42.677 --> 00:07:43.911
It was very light

00:07:45.346 --> 00:07:46.682
"Sunset in Misiryeong", right?

00:07:53.446 --> 00:07:54.992
It's beautiful.

00:08:14.276 --> 00:08:16.351
Won, look.

00:08:22.646 --> 00:08:25.091
We always pictured this place together.

00:08:26.446 --> 00:08:28.691
I'm so glad I came here with you.

00:08:32.257 --> 00:08:33.661
I think I can say it now.

00:08:54.246 --> 00:08:55.521
I'm getting married.

00:09:10.996 --> 00:09:14.612
(A Piece of Your Mind)

00:09:16.137 --> 00:09:17.811
So she ran away?

00:09:19.236 --> 00:09:21.137
She didn't exactly run away.

00:09:21.137 --> 00:09:24.277
That's the same thing. I mean, was that really necessary?

00:09:24.277 --> 00:09:26.346
She changed her mind and dumped him.

00:09:26.346 --> 00:09:28.191
It's ridiculous.

00:09:31.817 --> 00:09:33.622
Did Ji Soo dump him?

00:09:35.116 --> 00:09:37.586
I'll plant a lot of herbs here...

00:09:37.586 --> 00:09:39.427
and make tea with the leaves...

00:09:39.427 --> 00:09:41.801
- for our customers. - There's no way you'd tell me.

00:09:46.996 --> 00:09:49.742
After breaking up with Kim Ji Soo, he told me to...

00:09:51.167 --> 00:09:52.411
I was flabbergasted.

00:09:57.336 --> 00:10:00.352
My grandma was a diplomat.

00:10:00.547 --> 00:10:02.647
She felt guilty that she couldn't do anything for the Koreans...

00:10:02.647 --> 00:10:06.387
who suffered injustice abroad.

00:10:06.387 --> 00:10:07.862
It's different now though.

00:10:08.057 --> 00:10:10.616
Anyway, Ha Won ended up alone...

00:10:10.616 --> 00:10:13.962
for a similar reason, and my grandma brought him here.

00:10:14.496 --> 00:10:16.071
That's how he became my uncle.

00:10:16.196 --> 00:10:18.401
- I told you about him before. - Yes, that he's so competent.

00:10:20.427 --> 00:10:22.311
When I first saw him...

00:10:22.736 --> 00:10:24.411
Oh, he and I are the same age.

00:10:24.537 --> 00:10:26.407
I call him as Won or Uncle.

00:10:26.407 --> 00:10:28.407
Sometimes, that guy or hey. It all indicates him.

00:10:28.407 --> 00:10:31.446
Specifically, we're going to keep...

00:10:31.446 --> 00:10:33.821
addressing CMOS architecture.

00:10:34.007 --> 00:10:37.746
The technology that allows low power circuits...

00:10:37.746 --> 00:10:40.521
to form in these components.

00:10:40.746 --> 00:10:43.456
When you put a low power...

00:10:43.456 --> 00:10:46.362
through a circuit...

00:10:46.527 --> 00:10:48.356
He was in a lecture in the States...

00:10:48.356 --> 00:10:51.271
when he got a call from Ji Soo, and he hopped on the next flight.

00:10:52.466 --> 00:10:55.171
He has been living in Seoul ever since.

00:10:55.267 --> 00:10:56.512
Where in the world is it?

00:11:01.206 --> 00:11:03.352
(47-435 Wokin-dong, Jongno-gu)

00:11:34.267 --> 00:11:35.352
Uncle?

00:11:36.736 --> 00:11:37.852
Soon Ho.

00:11:38.507 --> 00:11:42.521
I witnessed the virtue and vice of his tenacious crush.

00:11:43.017 --> 00:11:45.321
Oh, that's the shipping address.

00:11:47.317 --> 00:11:48.492
What am I saying?

00:11:48.687 --> 00:11:51.301
Gosh, why am I crying over this?

00:11:54.287 --> 00:11:56.002
Where did you live?

00:11:56.527 --> 00:11:57.941
That is restricted.

00:12:00.427 --> 00:12:02.671
What does your address have to do with the research?

00:12:03.496 --> 00:12:04.882
Where were you with Kim Ji Soo?

00:12:05.206 --> 00:12:07.082
Oslo. Seoul.

00:12:08.307 --> 00:12:09.382
Gangneung.

00:12:10.876 --> 00:12:12.921
When did you go to Gangneung with her?

00:12:13.476 --> 00:12:14.876
We broke up there,

00:12:14.876 --> 00:12:16.817
and I lived there alone for a few months the following year.

00:12:16.817 --> 00:12:19.661
- What year was it exactly? - 2013.

00:12:20.086 --> 00:12:21.992
2013?

00:12:22.757 --> 00:12:25.002
That's when you were developing the tracking device.

00:12:25.287 --> 00:12:27.557
Hey, where you lived is restricted,

00:12:27.557 --> 00:12:29.696
but when I asked you where you were with Kim Ji Soo,

00:12:29.696 --> 00:12:32.002
you told me everything.

00:12:36.366 --> 00:12:37.966
I can get all the information...

00:12:37.966 --> 00:12:40.482
if I ask indirectly relating it to Kim Ji Soo.

00:12:40.807 --> 00:12:42.576
I guess it has something to do with the point of reaction.

00:12:42.576 --> 00:12:44.082
Try changing the password.

00:12:44.407 --> 00:12:45.576
Any other problems?

00:12:45.576 --> 00:12:47.852
It's fine as long as it isn't your device.

00:12:48.116 --> 00:12:50.446
Share it with the hospital...

00:12:50.446 --> 00:12:53.116
after training it with virtual patients and improving its accuracy.

00:12:53.116 --> 00:12:55.257
But you need real patients to test it on...

00:12:55.257 --> 00:12:56.316
to improve its accuracy.

00:12:56.317 --> 00:12:57.561
So you must...

00:12:58.527 --> 00:12:59.762
discard this.

00:13:00.586 --> 00:13:03.771
Let's put an end to our unofficial test here.

00:13:14.677 --> 00:13:15.911
- What? - What?

00:13:18.647 --> 00:13:21.246
I mean, it chatted with me...

00:13:21.246 --> 00:13:24.321
and answered all my silly questions.

00:13:25.187 --> 00:13:27.517
Thinking you'll throw it out,

00:13:27.517 --> 00:13:30.592
I feel kind of bad.

00:13:35.996 --> 00:13:37.232
What?

00:13:40.596 --> 00:13:42.041
Since it's for treatment.

00:13:42.567 --> 00:13:44.071
For treatment?

00:13:57.246 --> 00:13:58.686
What do you think?

00:13:58.687 --> 00:14:00.892
I like it.

00:14:01.356 --> 00:14:02.691
Try mixing it.

00:14:03.187 --> 00:14:04.187
Pardon?

00:14:04.187 --> 00:14:06.462
Me? I'm still...

00:14:06.757 --> 00:14:08.332
You need experience to improve.

00:14:08.757 --> 00:14:11.642
You have a good ear, so I have high hopes for you.

00:14:12.167 --> 00:14:13.742
Thank you.

00:14:16.297 --> 00:14:18.411
It feels strange that all of us are here.

00:14:18.736 --> 00:14:21.451
If I join too, we'll have our original team again.

00:14:21.677 --> 00:14:23.476
What did the studio tell you?

00:14:23.476 --> 00:14:25.147
Did they make it clear yet?

00:14:25.147 --> 00:14:26.551
Not yet.

00:14:28.946 --> 00:14:31.246
We're recording a live play this week.

00:14:31.246 --> 00:14:32.321
And?

00:14:33.047 --> 00:14:34.687
Come if you want to watch.

00:14:34.687 --> 00:14:36.862
The place is small but nice for capturing sounds.

00:14:37.057 --> 00:14:38.431
It'll be helpful to you.

00:14:39.787 --> 00:14:40.962
I see.

00:14:41.826 --> 00:14:42.972
(Before Dawn, They didn't meet)

00:14:47.567 --> 00:14:49.972
Is Before Dawn not coming anymore?

00:14:58.677 --> 00:15:00.252
Excuse me.

00:15:07.187 --> 00:15:08.862
Did she say she was miserable?

00:15:09.187 --> 00:15:11.427
She was miserable, but she didn't say it.

00:15:11.427 --> 00:15:13.362
That means she's miserable.

00:15:18.267 --> 00:15:20.602
I'm done meddling with their relationship now.

00:15:23.167 --> 00:15:25.236
Order a drink if you want. I don't drink.

00:15:25.236 --> 00:15:26.811
I'm okay too.

00:15:28.976 --> 00:15:31.882
I feel so bad for that guy Ha Won.

00:15:32.346 --> 00:15:34.375
I don't feel bad for him at all.

00:15:34.376 --> 00:15:36.051
He's so like me.

00:15:37.946 --> 00:15:39.116
In what way?

00:15:39.116 --> 00:15:41.632
He believes it exists when it actually doesn't.

00:15:41.687 --> 00:15:43.862
I'm great at it, you know.

00:15:44.387 --> 00:15:47.757
I always run toward it, dream about it,

00:15:47.757 --> 00:15:49.496
read too much into it,

00:15:49.496 --> 00:15:52.397
and pour my heart and soul and my time into it.

00:15:52.397 --> 00:15:54.771
But for more than 10 years, he...

00:15:55.567 --> 00:15:57.336
Who has unrequited love these days?

00:15:57.336 --> 00:15:59.236
They're competitive even about love.

00:15:59.236 --> 00:16:00.866
They argue about who loves the other more.

00:16:00.866 --> 00:16:04.582
They measure and weigh love although it's unmeasurable.

00:16:05.876 --> 00:16:09.092
But he says a small piece of her is enough.

00:16:10.777 --> 00:16:12.517
I guess he told you all sorts of things in hiding.

00:16:12.517 --> 00:16:15.892
How do you think he endured 10 years?

00:16:16.287 --> 00:16:17.492
I wonder.

00:16:20.626 --> 00:16:22.771
Wouldn't it be possible if she was precious to him?

00:16:25.966 --> 00:16:29.712
I think it would be possible if she were the center of his life.

00:16:31.966 --> 00:16:35.082
You know how a single word can let some people go on living.

00:16:39.407 --> 00:16:41.392
A single word.

00:16:42.616 --> 00:16:46.345
There is something that I think would keep me going...

00:16:46.346 --> 00:16:49.362
for about three years if someone would say it to me.

00:16:49.757 --> 00:16:51.732
Something no one ever says to me.

00:16:54.486 --> 00:16:55.931
"Stay."

00:16:57.126 --> 00:16:59.666
The real estate agent called me several times...

00:16:59.666 --> 00:17:01.497
to sell the semi-basement unit.

00:17:01.497 --> 00:17:04.572
I'd sell it off right away if it weren't for you.

00:17:05.467 --> 00:17:07.241
"Seo Woo."

00:17:08.037 --> 00:17:09.336
"Stay."

00:17:09.336 --> 00:17:10.676
I'll get going.

00:17:10.676 --> 00:17:12.552
Okay, bye.

00:17:12.676 --> 00:17:15.277
- Now, the cello. - Okay.

00:17:15.277 --> 00:17:16.852
"Seo Woo."

00:17:17.346 --> 00:17:18.792
"Stay."

00:17:30.356 --> 00:17:32.971
I wonder what Ha Won's next assignment will be.

00:17:35.396 --> 00:17:37.011
I doubt there will be any.

00:17:37.396 --> 00:17:39.711
Really? Did she say that?

00:17:40.267 --> 00:17:42.411
(Eatery)

00:18:32.757 --> 00:18:34.261
I hear you're miserable.

00:18:49.914 --> 00:18:51.449
I hear you're miserable.

00:19:00.124 --> 00:19:01.929
I hear you're miserable.

00:19:03.824 --> 00:19:05.770
You haven't called in years,

00:19:06.465 --> 00:19:07.664
and the first thing you say...

00:19:07.664 --> 00:19:09.139
I told you to call me.

00:19:12.935 --> 00:19:15.149
I could tell you were unhappy even from behind.

00:19:15.235 --> 00:19:18.850
Why did you run so hard? You don't even run that well.

00:19:24.074 --> 00:19:25.689
It's been a while.

00:19:29.654 --> 00:19:31.084
I'm not miserable.

00:19:31.084 --> 00:19:32.729
Then why did you run away?

00:19:33.854 --> 00:19:35.925
Because you showed up out of the blue.

00:19:35.925 --> 00:19:37.699
Then how else was I supposed to show up?

00:19:43.864 --> 00:19:47.010
Won, I can't really talk right now.

00:19:47.604 --> 00:19:49.709
- Let's talk later... - Later when?

00:19:58.644 --> 00:20:00.620
Let's talk again in 20 minutes.

00:20:06.154 --> 00:20:07.229
(Ha Won)

00:20:44.495 --> 00:20:46.570
My fiance knows you.

00:20:46.725 --> 00:20:48.510
He seems to be bothered by you.

00:20:49.235 --> 00:20:50.909
Who is he that he knows me?

00:20:52.235 --> 00:20:56.034
He has been with me ever since you left.

00:20:56.035 --> 00:20:58.209
So you knew him in Norway?

00:20:59.304 --> 00:21:00.445
Who could...

00:21:00.445 --> 00:21:02.320
Can you not try to find out?

00:21:02.844 --> 00:21:04.120
Please.

00:21:12.654 --> 00:21:14.060
Do you love him?

00:21:15.295 --> 00:21:16.600
Well,

00:21:16.955 --> 00:21:19.664
I feel like I grow when I'm with him.

00:21:19.664 --> 00:21:20.925
We get each other musically...

00:21:20.925 --> 00:21:22.040
So...

00:21:24.564 --> 00:21:26.040
do you love him?

00:21:27.935 --> 00:21:29.149
Yes.

00:21:47.455 --> 00:21:50.330
Please respect my decision.

00:21:52.925 --> 00:21:54.439
Of course, I do.

00:21:56.295 --> 00:21:57.540
But...

00:22:01.304 --> 00:22:03.010
you get married.

00:22:05.644 --> 00:22:07.919
I'll keep loving you as I always have.

00:22:11.344 --> 00:22:13.245
The fact that I love you...

00:22:13.245 --> 00:22:15.560
won't affect your life in any way.

00:22:16.084 --> 00:22:19.899
I'll never intrude on your life, so don't worry.

00:22:24.324 --> 00:22:26.000
Please respect my decision too.

00:22:34.505 --> 00:22:35.909
I have faith you'll be well.

00:22:38.304 --> 00:22:39.449
You have to be.

00:22:42.175 --> 00:22:43.320
But...

00:22:45.545 --> 00:22:47.489
call me when you become miserable.

00:23:03.834 --> 00:23:08.010
(Ji Soo)

00:23:15.005 --> 00:23:17.949
Sure. The voice recording, the shipping address...

00:23:18.814 --> 00:23:20.060
It was all you.

00:23:21.215 --> 00:23:22.330
Why?

00:23:23.114 --> 00:23:24.260
To refresh...

00:23:29.854 --> 00:23:31.270
your recollection.

00:23:32.364 --> 00:23:33.969
To call me when you become miserable.

00:23:35.334 --> 00:23:36.795
I wanted to do it once every 10 years,

00:23:36.795 --> 00:23:38.439
and you got me from the start.

00:23:39.535 --> 00:23:40.709
You and your "being miserable".

00:23:41.975 --> 00:23:44.709
I can't say I'm perfectly happy,

00:23:45.804 --> 00:23:47.719
but I can't say I'm miserable either.

00:23:49.715 --> 00:23:53.060
I'm sufficiently miserable and sufficiently happy.

00:23:53.485 --> 00:23:54.790
You're making no sense.

00:23:57.515 --> 00:23:58.729
I'm doing well.

00:24:02.054 --> 00:24:04.370
- Ji Soo. - I won't run away next time.

00:24:05.025 --> 00:24:06.199
Okay?

00:24:08.364 --> 00:24:09.469
Ji Soo.

00:24:11.265 --> 00:24:13.110
"Ji Soo."

00:24:14.205 --> 00:24:15.679
It's been so long...

00:24:28.854 --> 00:24:31.459
Hey. I'm doing just fine.

00:24:32.054 --> 00:24:33.199
Don't worry.

00:24:42.295 --> 00:24:46.005
I was going to ask you first before throwing it out.

00:24:46.005 --> 00:24:47.280
Why would you throw it out?

00:24:48.035 --> 00:24:51.005
Let's try leaving it out when it rains.

00:24:51.005 --> 00:24:52.780
Rain rejuvenates them at times.

00:24:52.945 --> 00:24:55.449
They grow crazy well when they get rainwater.

00:24:55.515 --> 00:24:56.914
What if someone steals it?

00:24:56.914 --> 00:24:58.314
Isn't it better if someone steals it...

00:24:58.314 --> 00:25:00.219
and saves it than it dying?

00:25:02.354 --> 00:25:04.554
- Hello. - Do you deliver?

00:25:04.554 --> 00:25:05.699
Of course.

00:25:12.965 --> 00:25:14.699
I guess he doesn't remember me.

00:25:18.864 --> 00:25:20.209
Do you want something in particular?

00:25:21.404 --> 00:25:24.250
- I'd like something small. - Look over there.

00:25:26.675 --> 00:25:28.219
Take your time.

00:25:55.005 --> 00:25:57.005
Hello, I'm Han Seo Woo.

00:25:57.005 --> 00:25:58.280
Hello, Seo Woo.

00:25:58.675 --> 00:26:00.320
Is it Seo Woo?

00:26:01.675 --> 00:26:02.750
Hello.

00:26:03.644 --> 00:26:05.590
I recognized you as soon as you walked in.

00:26:05.844 --> 00:26:07.860
- Don't you remember me? - Hello?

00:26:09.914 --> 00:26:11.354
Yes?

00:26:11.354 --> 00:26:13.455
Mr. Choi checked the cello sonata recording...

00:26:13.455 --> 00:26:15.255
and approved it,

00:26:15.255 --> 00:26:17.000
so I emailed you the file.

00:26:17.795 --> 00:26:18.925
I mixed it,

00:26:18.925 --> 00:26:21.139
but Mr. Choi said it was good.

00:26:21.164 --> 00:26:23.110
Would you please listen to it?

00:26:23.965 --> 00:26:26.040
It's the first I've ever mixed.

00:26:26.134 --> 00:26:28.580
- Congratulations. I'll check it. - Congratulations on what?

00:26:33.045 --> 00:26:34.780
I'll ask her once you're off the phone.

00:26:35.574 --> 00:26:37.914
Seo Woo, someone says she'll call you.

00:26:37.914 --> 00:26:39.020
Okay.

00:26:39.545 --> 00:26:41.620
Okay. Bye.

00:26:42.584 --> 00:26:44.989
You hung up already? I feel bad.

00:26:45.824 --> 00:26:47.030
Han Seo Woo. Han...

00:26:52.195 --> 00:26:54.699
Seo Woo. I hear congratulations are in order.

00:26:55.495 --> 00:26:57.370
What do you mean, how do I know?

00:26:57.735 --> 00:26:59.610
I told you. It's a small world.

00:26:59.965 --> 00:27:02.409
Will you come here if you're not busy?

00:27:03.475 --> 00:27:04.979
The address is...

00:27:05.844 --> 00:27:08.080
I wanted to clarify something.

00:27:08.374 --> 00:27:10.850
Can I keep working at the studio?

00:27:11.475 --> 00:27:14.045
Even when we don't have recordings scheduled.

00:27:14.045 --> 00:27:15.459
Most studios have someone like that.

00:27:16.314 --> 00:27:17.459
I don't know.

00:27:18.314 --> 00:27:19.755
Please tell me,

00:27:19.755 --> 00:27:22.600
so that I know whether or not to let the studio grow on me.

00:27:26.164 --> 00:27:27.725
I guess everything is personal to you.

00:27:27.725 --> 00:27:32.040
Of course. Every single thing, every corner, is mine when I work.

00:27:32.864 --> 00:27:35.409
Okay. Then it makes sense that you want to know.

00:27:35.804 --> 00:27:36.949
Give me a minute.

00:27:50.114 --> 00:27:51.189
Hey.

00:27:54.755 --> 00:27:56.030
Tell her to stay.

00:27:56.554 --> 00:27:57.629
Okay.

00:27:59.225 --> 00:28:00.370
Stay.

00:28:01.094 --> 00:28:02.169
Excuse me?

00:28:02.965 --> 00:28:04.209
He says to stay.

00:28:05.035 --> 00:28:07.010
Keep staying at the studio.

00:28:10.404 --> 00:28:12.679
Is that Ha Won too?

00:28:12.844 --> 00:28:15.550
Your entire world is filled with Ha Won, isn't it?

00:28:16.745 --> 00:28:19.120
I was important to him.

00:28:20.384 --> 00:28:24.189
No one can be important to him on a personal level.

00:28:25.525 --> 00:28:26.629
Let's go.

00:28:41.705 --> 00:28:45.379
(Ji Soo)

00:28:56.485 --> 00:28:57.560
Hey.

00:28:58.354 --> 00:29:00.530
I was doing the laundry, so I couldn't pick up.

00:29:01.054 --> 00:29:02.129
What's up?

00:29:02.525 --> 00:29:04.629
Ji Soo even does laundry now?

00:29:06.864 --> 00:29:09.169
I'm so speechless, I can't help but laugh.

00:29:10.995 --> 00:29:12.540
You called for no reason, didn't you?

00:29:14.904 --> 00:29:15.979
That's right.

00:29:42.765 --> 00:29:43.870
You came.

00:30:01.745 --> 00:30:03.260
(Ji Soo)

00:30:07.084 --> 00:30:09.229
(Sindongmun)

00:30:17.035 --> 00:30:18.840
You sent me a new message?

00:30:20.505 --> 00:30:21.580
It suddenly...

00:30:23.475 --> 00:30:25.449
got dark and started to rain, right?

00:30:27.104 --> 00:30:29.719
- Yes. - That's my message too.

00:30:31.175 --> 00:30:32.820
The sun rising, and setting,

00:30:34.384 --> 00:30:37.790
the wind blowing, and it raining. All of it.

00:30:39.154 --> 00:30:42.399
Everything you saw, heard, and gazed upon... Everything.

00:30:43.795 --> 00:30:46.840
It's my message to be happy wherever you are.

00:31:07.844 --> 00:31:09.229
It's from Kang In Wook.

00:31:40.545 --> 00:31:42.755
Is today the only day we can record it here?

00:31:42.755 --> 00:31:44.729
- Yes. Probably. - How much time do we have?

00:31:45.114 --> 00:31:47.459
One hour. It's hard to rent this place.

00:31:51.195 --> 00:31:52.500
Record that for me now.

00:31:54.624 --> 00:31:55.770
Seo Woo!

00:31:56.834 --> 00:31:59.879
Seo Woo. Can you find just the piano?

00:32:01.834 --> 00:32:02.949
Yes.

00:32:03.604 --> 00:32:04.679
Look for me.

00:32:07.374 --> 00:32:09.620
Was that not a person's voice?

00:32:43.215 --> 00:32:44.449
Stay here.

00:32:45.414 --> 00:32:46.790
In Wook.

00:32:53.185 --> 00:32:56.830
If I could apologize...

00:32:59.995 --> 00:33:01.300
To whom?

00:33:03.994 --> 00:33:05.509
Are you going to Oslo?

00:33:05.865 --> 00:33:07.139
Should I?

00:33:14.104 --> 00:33:16.420
If you're going to apologize to just scenery, do it here.

00:33:20.414 --> 00:33:21.960
What if...

00:33:25.115 --> 00:33:27.330
I could apologize to Won?

00:33:31.155 --> 00:33:32.870
You don't keep in touch with him.

00:33:34.795 --> 00:33:36.635
I know his email address.

00:33:36.635 --> 00:33:38.909
- I can call... - It's nothing to apologize for.

00:33:40.305 --> 00:33:43.449
How many times must I tell you that it makes me miserable...

00:33:43.505 --> 00:33:45.650
and that it's too hard for me?

00:33:47.144 --> 00:33:51.275
Ji Soo. This isn't a problem as long as you're okay with it.

00:33:51.275 --> 00:33:53.190
It's not worth making us...

00:33:56.885 --> 00:33:58.259
like this.

00:34:00.485 --> 00:34:02.299
It's your problem now.

00:35:16.264 --> 00:35:17.870
I saw you come in.

00:35:18.295 --> 00:35:19.880
Do you know this place?

00:35:20.204 --> 00:35:22.909
This is my favorite cafe. Isn't it nice?

00:35:23.305 --> 00:35:24.980
You looked like you were watching someone.

00:35:25.974 --> 00:35:27.580
I was people-watching.

00:35:27.744 --> 00:35:28.845
I like doing that.

00:35:28.845 --> 00:35:30.089
Alone?

00:35:30.974 --> 00:35:33.190
Maybe someone will come.

00:35:33.845 --> 00:35:35.514
I'm so clueless.

00:35:35.514 --> 00:35:37.359
I'll go to another table.

00:35:38.255 --> 00:35:40.425
Actually, I have happy news.

00:35:40.425 --> 00:35:42.699
The studio said to keep coming.

00:35:43.354 --> 00:35:46.799
Congratulations. I won't be going there anymore.

00:35:48.224 --> 00:35:49.739
Did you finish?

00:35:52.365 --> 00:35:54.839
From now on, I'm going to enjoy coffee and music in the mornings,

00:35:55.905 --> 00:35:57.310
rather than cleaning.

00:36:00.244 --> 00:36:01.650
As you should.

00:36:04.675 --> 00:36:06.120
You see over there?

00:36:06.514 --> 00:36:09.389
That's where Ha Won missed Ji Soo.

00:36:09.414 --> 00:36:11.529
And I almost found Ha Won.

00:36:15.385 --> 00:36:18.830
Is there something you want to ask that person Ha Won?

00:36:21.325 --> 00:36:22.710
No.

00:36:23.334 --> 00:36:25.639
I just want to see him from afar.

00:36:26.905 --> 00:36:28.210
From afar?

00:36:29.334 --> 00:36:31.650
I want to see his face from afar.

00:36:32.675 --> 00:36:33.874
Why from afar?

00:36:33.874 --> 00:36:37.389
If I'm too close, he'll see that I pity him.

00:36:39.784 --> 00:36:41.290
He'll see that look on my face.

00:36:42.485 --> 00:36:44.985
I want to see what he looks like from afar.

00:36:44.985 --> 00:36:47.425
"So that's what someone who does something like that looks like."

00:36:47.425 --> 00:36:50.699
I'll just look at his face. I wouldn't ask him anything.

00:36:51.425 --> 00:36:54.440
I hope you work a very long time at the place that asked you to stay.

00:36:58.534 --> 00:36:59.609
Thank you.

00:37:04.374 --> 00:37:05.805
Work here.

00:37:05.805 --> 00:37:07.949
You said you were waiting for someone.

00:37:08.675 --> 00:37:09.775
I don't think the person is coming.

00:37:09.775 --> 00:37:11.989
I'm sure they will. I'll...

00:37:13.885 --> 00:37:16.889
There are plenty of other places nearby where I can work.

00:37:34.764 --> 00:37:37.609
Why am I sad to hear I won't see him again?

00:37:59.365 --> 00:38:00.699
Won,

00:38:01.994 --> 00:38:03.909
do you want to go to Norway?

00:38:12.374 --> 00:38:13.505
When?

00:38:13.505 --> 00:38:15.420
Tomorrow is good too.

00:38:17.514 --> 00:38:18.719
Why?

00:38:19.314 --> 00:38:21.460
I need your help.

00:38:22.684 --> 00:38:25.060
There's something I need you to do there.

00:38:28.485 --> 00:38:29.699
What is it?

00:38:31.894 --> 00:38:34.264
You just have to say one thing.

00:38:34.264 --> 00:38:35.799
What's that?

00:38:36.595 --> 00:38:38.109
I'll say it now.

00:38:40.604 --> 00:38:42.135
Well...

00:38:42.135 --> 00:38:44.310
It's okay. Tell me.

00:38:45.204 --> 00:38:47.020
Tell me, and I'll help you.

00:38:47.945 --> 00:38:50.920
I shouldn't have said anything. Sorry.

00:38:51.374 --> 00:38:53.719
- I'll call you again... - Let's go tomorrow.

00:38:56.155 --> 00:38:57.989
I'll help you, and then you can tell me.

00:39:00.784 --> 00:39:03.354
Okay. Let's meet at the cafe.

00:39:03.354 --> 00:39:04.630
I know.

00:39:05.354 --> 00:39:06.799
Where you ran away.

00:39:09.494 --> 00:39:11.839
See you there tomorrow morning...

00:39:15.534 --> 00:39:17.509
It's nothing to apologize for.

00:39:17.775 --> 00:39:20.850
How many times must I tell you that it makes me miserable...

00:39:20.874 --> 00:39:23.219
and that it's too hard for me?

00:39:24.474 --> 00:39:26.344
Never mind. No.

00:39:26.345 --> 00:39:29.784
I'll call you tonight after I think it over some more.

00:39:29.784 --> 00:39:31.690
What are you thinking about?

00:39:34.224 --> 00:39:35.954
It may be too hard for you...

00:39:35.954 --> 00:39:37.170
See you tomorrow.

00:40:28.275 --> 00:40:29.790
Are you here for the cafe?

00:40:31.115 --> 00:40:32.350
Yes.

00:40:32.474 --> 00:40:34.290
Would you like to wait inside?

00:40:35.485 --> 00:40:36.759
Thank you.

00:41:50.155 --> 00:41:51.529
Leave.

00:41:52.965 --> 00:41:56.609
I'll stay behind and find out why.

00:42:36.434 --> 00:42:39.080
I'm sorry again about the other day.

00:42:39.235 --> 00:42:41.005
Please call or text me when you have time.

00:42:41.005 --> 00:42:43.514
(I'm sorry again about the other day.)

00:42:43.514 --> 00:42:44.545
(I'm nearby.)

00:42:44.545 --> 00:42:45.719
I'm nearby.

00:42:56.184 --> 00:42:57.299
Over here.

00:43:02.994 --> 00:43:05.069
It can be a gift or a nuisance.

00:43:05.834 --> 00:43:08.080
- What is it? - A plant.

00:43:08.564 --> 00:43:10.279
Keep it if you can grow it.

00:43:10.434 --> 00:43:13.350
If not, just water it a little for a few days.

00:43:13.505 --> 00:43:14.880
It's quite finicky.

00:43:15.144 --> 00:43:16.850
I'm super good with plants.

00:43:17.675 --> 00:43:19.620
Then it's a gift. It's all yours.

00:43:20.584 --> 00:43:22.389
What were you doing nearby?

00:43:24.985 --> 00:43:26.759
I had something to decide.

00:43:27.854 --> 00:43:29.259
I'm going to go alone.

00:43:29.724 --> 00:43:32.429
I'm scared, but I'm going to go.

00:43:35.025 --> 00:43:38.069
It concerns me that you're scared.

00:43:41.235 --> 00:43:42.679
I'll be fine.

00:43:43.405 --> 00:43:46.279
I gained courage the moment I told you.

00:43:49.845 --> 00:43:51.049
Tell me more.

00:43:51.474 --> 00:43:53.920
I'll listen to everything you want to say.

00:43:55.084 --> 00:43:57.429
I received a gift and everything. Say anything you want.

00:43:58.055 --> 00:44:00.199
It's okay if it's about things that upset you.

00:44:18.005 --> 00:44:19.080
Before...

00:44:19.704 --> 00:44:21.480
I met my husband,

00:44:22.604 --> 00:44:24.750
he did something...

00:44:25.874 --> 00:44:27.859
He made a mistake.

00:44:30.655 --> 00:44:32.630
Now that I found out about it,

00:44:33.954 --> 00:44:35.500
it's too hard for me to bear.

00:44:37.825 --> 00:44:40.969
My whole world turned upside down in an instant.

00:44:43.795 --> 00:44:45.239
This...

00:44:46.564 --> 00:44:48.239
This pain...

00:44:50.505 --> 00:44:51.949
is all new to me.

00:44:55.104 --> 00:44:56.219
This...

00:44:57.575 --> 00:44:58.690
is too...

00:45:03.414 --> 00:45:04.889
You didn't go to the mountain, did you?

00:45:05.055 --> 00:45:07.029
I said to go somewhere high up.

00:45:07.325 --> 00:45:09.500
It's therapeutic to look down on the world.

00:45:10.224 --> 00:45:12.670
You can scream as loudly as you can.

00:45:14.695 --> 00:45:16.639
Do you want to scream in there?

00:45:16.994 --> 00:45:19.810
It's soundproofed, so it's the best at relieving stress.

00:45:25.575 --> 00:45:28.480
There's something particular that you want to hear,

00:45:30.115 --> 00:45:32.389
and not these silly things, right?

00:45:34.644 --> 00:45:37.130
That one thing that you feel would make it all go away.

00:45:41.755 --> 00:45:42.960
"It's okay."

00:45:47.064 --> 00:45:48.739
"It's nothing."

00:46:05.845 --> 00:46:08.089
Everyone makes mistakes.

00:46:10.314 --> 00:46:12.130
Even nature makes mistakes.

00:46:15.655 --> 00:46:17.130
My parents...

00:46:18.224 --> 00:46:21.000
died in a forest fire.

00:46:23.664 --> 00:46:25.509
I don't usually tell people this.

00:46:32.005 --> 00:46:33.750
Even nature makes mistakes.

00:46:35.275 --> 00:46:37.719
It's okay. It's nothing.

00:46:50.155 --> 00:46:51.299
Just a minute.

00:47:21.624 --> 00:47:24.029
(Dear Before Dawn. Please clean before you leave.)

00:47:25.555 --> 00:47:27.870
(Dear Before Dawn. Please clean before you leave.)

00:47:31.795 --> 00:47:33.739
"Nightlike afternoon."

00:47:35.834 --> 00:47:38.080
Even objects fall flat on their faces.

00:47:38.175 --> 00:47:40.520
It's just me and the machines. How strange is that?

00:47:41.204 --> 00:47:43.549
What is this?

00:47:45.215 --> 00:47:46.319
This?

00:47:49.084 --> 00:47:51.389
I think Before Dawn wrote this.

00:47:52.914 --> 00:47:54.960
I wonder what he does for a living.

00:47:55.284 --> 00:47:56.799
This is a flowchart.

00:47:57.695 --> 00:47:58.830
Dawn?

00:47:59.055 --> 00:48:00.664
I call him "Before Dawn"...

00:48:00.664 --> 00:48:02.969
because he rents this space for four hours early in the morning.

00:48:04.135 --> 00:48:05.994
You know, I ran into him yesterday...

00:48:05.994 --> 00:48:07.440
at the cafe we go to all the time.

00:48:08.005 --> 00:48:09.440
He said he won't be coming anymore.

00:48:12.505 --> 00:48:14.750
He asked out of the blue if I was miserable,

00:48:15.075 --> 00:48:16.380
so I wondered why.

00:48:17.845 --> 00:48:19.190
So this is how he knew.

00:48:22.945 --> 00:48:25.759
You said you never saw Ha Won, right?

00:48:25.914 --> 00:48:28.759
Yes. I saw him from behind from far away. That's all.

00:48:31.454 --> 00:48:32.870
I think you will see him.

00:48:33.264 --> 00:48:34.940
You may have already.

00:48:36.865 --> 00:48:37.969
What?

00:48:39.564 --> 00:48:40.679
I'm glad.

00:51:20.325 --> 00:51:21.569
Is something wrong?

00:51:22.994 --> 00:51:24.670
I can't concentrate.

00:51:27.834 --> 00:51:29.480
I can't reschedule anymore.

00:51:32.974 --> 00:51:35.779
One more song and we're done.

00:51:41.584 --> 00:51:42.920
Why did you go?

00:51:47.124 --> 00:51:48.529
Why?

00:51:59.865 --> 00:52:02.339
- Please take your time. - Thank you.

00:52:49.144 --> 00:52:51.389
This isn't good.

00:54:01.155 --> 00:54:04.730
Nice. That was good.

00:56:19.555 --> 00:56:21.239
I guess she isn't coming today either.

00:56:21.795 --> 00:56:23.325
She'll come eventually.

00:56:23.325 --> 00:56:26.195
Once she does, I'll testify as to how much you waited.

00:56:26.195 --> 00:56:27.805
Make sure to collect for it all.

00:56:27.805 --> 00:56:29.505
You have to. You promised.

00:56:29.505 --> 00:56:30.679
I will.

00:56:32.204 --> 00:56:35.750
The moon is huge tonight. It looks like it's coming toward us.

00:56:40.715 --> 00:56:42.290
Make a wish.

00:56:43.314 --> 00:56:44.589
She'll come.

00:57:01.465 --> 00:57:02.810
Hello?

00:57:02.905 --> 00:57:04.609
It's...

00:57:05.005 --> 00:57:06.679
blinding here.

00:57:06.874 --> 00:57:08.779
It's so nice.

00:57:11.045 --> 00:57:14.319
Now that I'm here, I wonder why I lived like that.

00:57:14.985 --> 00:57:16.584
All my anxiety lifted.

00:57:16.584 --> 00:57:18.029
Where are you?

00:57:18.684 --> 00:57:21.429
I'm on the path I used to walk all the time with Won.

00:57:21.885 --> 00:57:23.460
In Norway?

00:57:26.724 --> 00:57:29.194
How did I forget this place?

00:57:29.195 --> 00:57:31.564
Did you always have such a cheerful voice?

00:57:31.564 --> 00:57:33.540
Your voice sounds completely different.

00:57:34.104 --> 00:57:35.905
I'm glad you went.

00:57:35.905 --> 00:57:38.103
I can handle it all.

00:57:38.104 --> 00:57:40.179
I'm a tough girl.

00:57:40.575 --> 00:57:42.880
I'm so glad I came alone.

00:57:44.974 --> 00:57:46.775
Seo Woo.

00:57:46.775 --> 00:57:50.989
Would you please tell Won not to wait at the cafe?

00:57:51.314 --> 00:57:53.154
I just came.

00:57:53.155 --> 00:57:57.195
He's very simpleminded, so I feel like he'll keep waiting.

00:57:57.195 --> 00:57:59.525
I told you, I don't know who he is.

00:57:59.525 --> 00:58:01.270
It's so easy.

00:58:01.894 --> 00:58:03.095
It's a quiz.

00:58:03.095 --> 00:58:05.870
I'll call you in a bit. Solve the quiz, okay?

00:58:07.334 --> 00:58:08.580
I'll give you a hint.

00:58:08.905 --> 00:58:10.980
You've already met him.

00:58:13.675 --> 00:58:15.719
I'll call you later.

00:58:16.144 --> 00:58:17.250
But...

00:58:19.244 --> 00:58:21.120
Who's Ha Won?

00:58:26.514 --> 00:58:28.560
Wouldn't it be possible if she was precious to him?

00:58:29.525 --> 00:58:33.270
I think it would be possible if she were the center of his life.

00:58:34.295 --> 00:58:35.839
No way.

00:58:39.894 --> 00:58:43.239
I became miserable, but I didn't call him.

00:58:43.334 --> 00:58:45.150
Did she say she was miserable?

00:58:50.045 --> 00:58:51.144
"Stay."

00:58:51.144 --> 00:58:54.485
He says to stay. Keep staying at the studio.

00:58:54.485 --> 00:58:57.489
I hope you work a very long time at the place that asked you to stay.

00:58:59.385 --> 00:59:01.500
Was that you too?

00:59:03.184 --> 00:59:05.600
Ms. Moon.

00:59:52.288 --> 00:59:55.202
I told you, I quit the piano a long time ago.

00:59:55.527 --> 00:59:58.928
You were the only one who didn't know that your favorite pupil...

00:59:58.928 --> 01:00:00.642
just didn't have the skills.

01:00:03.728 --> 01:00:06.598
Won lives in Seoul, but his skin is fine.

01:00:06.598 --> 01:00:08.443
He's very healthy.

01:00:33.328 --> 01:00:35.573
Won's mother, whom I love...

01:00:36.428 --> 01:00:38.742
and miss so very much.

01:00:41.107 --> 01:00:42.782
May I...

01:00:45.808 --> 01:00:47.952
apologize on his behalf?

01:02:46.357 --> 01:02:48.073
(Kim Ji Soo)

01:02:50.768 --> 01:02:53.573
Is he really Before Dawn? Is Ha Won Before Dawn?

01:02:57.437 --> 01:02:58.512
Hello?

01:02:59.337 --> 01:03:00.483
I...

01:03:01.178 --> 01:03:02.622
I...

01:03:03.377 --> 01:03:04.452
Ji Soo?

01:03:06.817 --> 01:03:09.992
Seo Woo. Did it go through?

01:03:13.658 --> 01:03:14.863
I was scared.

01:03:16.487 --> 01:03:17.832
What's wrong?

01:03:18.897 --> 01:03:21.003
It snowed too much.

01:03:23.067 --> 01:03:25.443
My old town isn't far from here.

01:03:25.538 --> 01:03:27.912
Can you walk out to a big street?

01:03:28.308 --> 01:03:30.383
I can't budge right now.

01:03:31.038 --> 01:03:33.713
It'll be better once it stops snowing.

01:03:40.917 --> 01:03:42.162
Are you listening to music?

01:03:44.618 --> 01:03:45.762
It's nice.

01:04:08.047 --> 01:04:09.282
I'm scared,

01:04:12.518 --> 01:04:13.653
but it's beautiful.

01:04:15.948 --> 01:04:18.562
I used to come here with Won all the time.

01:04:25.998 --> 01:04:27.297
Did you call a rescue team?

01:04:27.297 --> 01:04:29.403
They must have that there too.

01:04:30.667 --> 01:04:31.912
They're on their way.

01:04:32.638 --> 01:04:34.812
Then hang up. Save your battery.

01:04:36.768 --> 01:04:38.012
That's probably wise...

01:05:07.768 --> 01:05:08.883
Ga.

01:05:10.737 --> 01:05:11.852
Gya.

01:05:13.777 --> 01:05:14.852
Gya.

01:05:16.707 --> 01:05:17.793
Geo.

01:05:20.147 --> 01:05:21.222
Gyeo.

01:05:25.718 --> 01:05:26.832
Ga.

01:05:28.957 --> 01:05:30.932
- Ga. - Gya.

01:05:31.297 --> 01:05:33.273
- Geo. - Gyeo.

01:05:33.558 --> 01:05:35.443
- Go. - Gyo.

01:05:35.698 --> 01:05:37.503
- Goo. - Gyoo.

01:05:37.667 --> 01:05:39.742
- Geu. - Gi.

01:05:40.067 --> 01:05:41.682
- Na. - Nya.

01:05:42.038 --> 01:05:43.843
- Neo. - Nyeo.

01:05:44.138 --> 01:05:45.782
- No. - Nyo.

01:05:45.937 --> 01:05:47.582
- Noo. - Nyoo.

01:05:47.777 --> 01:05:48.808
Neu.

01:05:48.808 --> 01:05:49.923
Ga.

01:05:51.078 --> 01:05:52.153
Gya.

01:05:57.817 --> 01:06:01.463
A single leaf Lands on the shoulder

01:06:01.828 --> 01:06:04.332
Without making a sound

01:06:05.498 --> 01:06:08.403
Cosmos laid its hand on me

01:06:08.797 --> 01:06:10.503
It was very light

01:06:13.468 --> 01:06:15.383
A single leaf

01:06:18.278 --> 01:06:20.482
Lands on the shoulder

01:06:22.547 --> 01:06:23.683
Without

01:06:24.947 --> 01:06:26.122
Making a sound

01:06:31.657 --> 01:06:33.293
Stop looking out the window.

01:06:36.188 --> 01:06:37.433
Look at the ceiling.

01:06:39.398 --> 01:06:40.633
It's soothing.

01:07:19.697 --> 01:07:20.973
Okay, Ji Soo.

01:07:22.938 --> 01:07:24.082
I'll...

01:07:25.707 --> 01:07:27.112
stop waiting.

01:07:39.718 --> 01:07:41.232
Hang on.

01:07:42.327 --> 01:07:44.433
Wait. Ha Won.

01:07:45.297 --> 01:07:47.003
Maybe someone will come.

01:07:47.827 --> 01:07:48.973
Ha Won.

01:07:59.638 --> 01:08:01.452
Hang on.

01:08:04.247 --> 01:08:05.353
Ji Soo.

01:08:06.218 --> 01:08:07.862
Hello? Ji Soo.

01:08:15.787 --> 01:08:17.003
I'm scared.

01:08:35.877 --> 01:08:38.492
(Kim Ji Soo)

01:09:55.728 --> 01:09:58.173
(A Piece of Your Mind)

01:09:58.457 --> 01:09:59.702
"Look for me."

01:09:59.928 --> 01:10:01.268
Please tell Ha Won...

01:10:01.268 --> 01:10:03.303
that doing that won't bring Ji Soo back.

01:10:03.627 --> 01:10:06.813
I left it all there. You liked Norway.

01:10:07.438 --> 01:10:09.768
Why weren't you answering your phone?

01:10:09.768 --> 01:10:12.013
Ha Won! I'm worried about Ha Won!

01:10:12.207 --> 01:10:13.482
What were you imagining?

01:10:13.638 --> 01:10:15.423
Conversing with the real Ji Soo.

01:10:15.577 --> 01:10:16.853
Do you want to borrow it?

01:10:17.808 --> 01:10:22.893
He is curious about everything when it comes to you.

01:10:23.718 --> 01:10:25.332
This is how I miss someone.

01:10:26.257 --> 01:10:28.103
The person you saw and spoke to...

01:10:29.188 --> 01:10:30.503
last.
