00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,435
<b>He followed the route mapped out in the travel guide,</b>

318
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,204
<b>but the city was nowhere to be found,</b>

319
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:46,405
<b>and he got lost in a dense forest.</b>

320
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:50,669
<b>After wandering the forest for two days,</b>

321
00:31:50,669 --> 00:31:52,415
<b>he finally managed to find his way out.</b>

322
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,540
<b>Then he returned home...</b>

323
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:57,145
<b>and showed the map to people, saying something's wrong with it.</b>

324
00:31:57,969 --> 00:32:00,615
<b>But someone, who saw the travel guide, said this.</b>

325
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,355
<b>"Look."</b>

326
00:32:02,379 --> 00:32:06,024
<b>"This travel guide was published right after the First World War."</b>

327
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:10,224
<b>"A century has passed since the First World War ended."</b>

328
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:16,590
<b>He did go to the place...</b>

329
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:18,804
<b>where he had wanted to go all his life,</b>

330
00:32:19,459 --> 00:32:22,169
<b>but it looked completely different from what he had seen...</b>

331
00:32:22,169 --> 00:32:24,575
<b>on the map he had studied countless times.</b>

332

<b>(Elderly British Man's Special Journey)</b>

333
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:28,139
<b>You call this beautiful?</b>

334
00:32:28,139 --> 00:32:29,740
<b>Not sad?</b>

335
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:30,815
<b>Right?</b>

336
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:32,484
<b>Really?</b>

337
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:35,355
<b>I think it's beautiful.</b>

338
00:32:36,149 --> 00:32:37,949
<b>His plan failed,</b>

339
00:32:37,949 --> 00:32:40,119
<b>but he went through the difficult journey...</b>

340
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:43,224
<b>for his happiness and to do what he had wanted to do for years.</b>

341
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:46,034
<b>I think that alone deserves applause.</b>

342
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,689
<b>As you all know, my dream...</b>

343
00:32:48,689 --> 00:32:51,835
<b>is to travel to a faraway land like that.</b>

344
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:56,699
<b>Challenging yourself like that is brave and beautiful,</b>

345

<b>- but this article... - Hold on.</b>

346
00:32:59,439 --> 00:33:02,869
<b>Doesn't this story remind you of "Bluebird"?</b>

347
00:33:02,869 --> 00:33:04,139
<b>- Oh, right. - In that book,</b>

348
00:33:04,139 --> 00:33:07,409
<b>two siblings begin a journey to find the bluebird of happiness,</b>

349
00:33:07,409 --> 00:33:09,085
<b>but they return without finding it.</b>

350
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:11,154
<b>I feel bad for them, Hwi.</b>

351
00:33:11,249 --> 00:33:12,855
<b>No, don't.</b>

352
00:33:12,979 --> 00:33:14,349
<b>They returned...</b>

353
00:33:14,349 --> 00:33:17,090
<b>and found the bluebird of happiness at home.</b>

354
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:18,965
<b>The story has a happy ending.</b>

355
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:22,030
<b>To be honest, I don't really like that story.</b>

356
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:23,689
<b>What? Why don't you like it?</b>

357
00:33:23,689 --> 00:33:25,160
<b>It just doesn't make sense.</b>

358
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,999
<b>Happiness was always there,</b>

359
00:33:26,999 --> 00:33:28,704
<b>but you just didn't know?</b>

360
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:30,030
<b>It's so futile.</b>

361
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:31,329
<b>Well, what's wrong with that?</b>

362
00:33:31,329 --> 00:33:32,669
<b>Maybe you just weren't aware of it.</b>

363
00:33:32,669 --> 00:33:33,999
<b>Right, I'm a gem,</b>

364
00:33:33,999 --> 00:33:36,410
<b>but Kim Young Soo doesn't see that. It's just like that.</b>

365
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:39,110
<b>- To him, you're not a gem... - Whatever! Quiet.</b>

366
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:40,185
<b>You're wrong.</b>

367
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:44,355
<b>Anyway, I'm personally not a fan of that story.</b>

368
00:33:44,849 --> 00:33:45,924
<b>Really?</b>

369
00:33:46,349 --> 00:33:48,154
<b>- But... - You're right.</b>

370
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:51,494
<b>I agree with you.</b>

371
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:55,665
<b>We go to a faraway land to find the bluebird of happiness,</b>

372
00:33:56,629 --> 00:34:00,134
<b>but the bluebird was at home the whole time?</b>

373
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:01,804
<b>Maybe...</b>

374
00:34:02,629 --> 00:34:04,945
<b>it's just an excuse we came up with...</b>

375
00:34:05,099 --> 00:34:08,344
<b>to console ourselves because it is hard to attain happiness.</b>

376
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:13,784
<b>I personally think that happiness is out of reach.</b>

377
00:34:14,439 --> 00:34:17,384
<b>Hae Won, still...</b>

378
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,320
<b>Right, it's just...</b>

379
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,320
<b>- my personal opinion. - No, it's not about that.</b>

380
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,395
<b>I am a gem.</b>

381
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:25,634
<b>- I really am. - This isn't about that.</b>

382
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:27,720
<b>I'm a gem, everyone.</b>

383
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:30,729
<b>But I saw him with Song Jae In...</b>

384
00:34:30,729 --> 00:34:32,605
<b>Song Jae In? Who's that?</b>

385
00:34:49,249 --> 00:34:50,724
<b>So...</b>

386
00:34:51,249 --> 00:34:53,355
<b>what's your plan for the signing event?</b>

387
00:34:53,879 --> 00:34:58,195
<b>Well... It's up to you, isn't it?</b>

388
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:04,059
<b>We could do something like, "Meet the Author".</b>

389
00:35:04,059 --> 00:35:05,204
<b>What do you think?</b>

390
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:06,804
<b>That sounds good.</b>

391
00:35:06,999 --> 00:35:09,074
<b>I'm fine with anything you suggest, Sweetie.</b>

392
00:35:10,169 --> 00:35:13,574
<b>By the way, can we go for another drink?</b>

393
00:35:14,439 --> 00:35:18,085
<b>Sure, something simple.</b>

394
00:35:33,289 --> 00:35:35,320
<b>- Come on. - No.</b>

395
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:38,129
<b>- Bye! - I am a gem!</b>

396
00:35:38,129 --> 00:35:39,530
<b>- Bye, Hae Won. - I am a gem!</b>

397
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:41,030
<b>- Gosh, let's go. - No, I really am.</b>

398
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:42,430
<b>- Seriously... - Bye, guys.</b>

399
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:44,999
<b>Can you please agree with me just once?</b>

400
00:35:44,999 --> 00:35:47,974
<b>All right, let's go.</b>

401
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:57,709
<b>I'll get going too.</b>

402
00:35:57,709 --> 00:35:58,895
<b>Just a moment.</b>

403
00:36:10,729 --> 00:36:11,804
<b>Take this.</b>

404
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:13,105
<b>What is it?</b>

405
00:36:13,459 --> 00:36:14,605
<b>Medicine.</b>

406
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,904
<b>Take it before sleep, and you'll feel better.</b>

407
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,344
<b>No, it's all right.</b>

408
00:36:27,809 --> 00:36:28,985
<b>(Medicine)</b>

<b>Mok Hae Won.</b>

411
00:36:49,829 --> 00:36:50,945
<b>Take this.</b>

412
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,145
<b>I said it's fine.</b>

413
00:36:54,039 --> 00:36:55,145
<b>Still...</b>

414
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:57,384
<b>No, thanks. I won't take the medicine anyway.</b>

415
00:36:58,010 --> 00:36:59,085
<b>Bye.</b>

416
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:02,255
<b>- Hae Won. - I said I won't take it.</b>

417
00:37:05,919 --> 00:37:07,025
<b>Just it with you.</b>

418
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:10,525
<b>You got better without taking any medicine.</b>

419
00:37:11,249 --> 00:37:12,720
<b>I won't take medicine either.</b>

420
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,360
<b>I'll feel better...</b>

421

<b>after a good night's sleep.</b>

422
00:37:16,329 --> 00:37:17,935
<b>Just take it, please.</b>

00:37:21,059 --> 00:37:22,134
<b>Please?</b>

424
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,404
<b>Then what will you do in return?</b>

425
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,315
<b>If I take this medicine,</b>

426
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:31,744
<b>what will you do for me in return?</b>

427

<b>I...</b>

<b>Yes.</b>

00:37:42,189 --> 00:37:43,924
<b>I'd like you to.</b>

431
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:46,665
<b>Like what?</b>

432
00:37:46,919 --> 00:37:48,264
<b>For example,</b>

433
00:37:50,229 --> 00:37:52,704
<b>you could give me an answer to my confession.</b>

434
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:00,514
<b>I want your answer.</b>

435
00:38:02,809 --> 00:38:04,114
<b>Can you do that for me?</b>

436
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:32,735
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

<b>Mom!</b>

<b>Where's my book?</b>

443
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:36,149
<b>Which book are you talking about?</b>

444
00:42:36,149 --> 00:42:38,410
<b>The one I have to read this week.</b>

445
00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:40,625
<b>I have to bring it to school, but I can't find it.</b>

446
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:43,149
<b>Didn't you give it to Eun Seop?</b>

447
00:42:43,149 --> 00:42:44,590
<b>You asked him to read it and tell you what it's about.</b>

<b>That's right. What do I do?</b>

449
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,689
<b>What do I do now?</b>

450
00:42:47,689 --> 00:42:49,729
<b>What else? I'll call Eun Seop.</b>

451
00:42:49,729 --> 00:42:52,404
<b>Okay. I'll go pack my bag.</b>

452
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:13,355
<b>Hello.</b>

453
00:43:15,919 --> 00:43:16,950
<b>Yes, Father.</b>

454
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:20,395
<b>It's about the book Hwi gave you the other day.</b>

455
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:22,704
<b>Oh, you mean the novel?</b>

456
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:27,459
<b>What was the title?</b>

457
00:43:27,459 --> 00:43:29,599
<b>Hey, what's the title?</b>

458
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:31,629
<b>The Rye something...</b>

459
00:43:31,629 --> 00:43:34,145
<b>She says, "The Rye something".</b>

460
00:43:35,499 --> 00:43:37,485
<b>"The Catcher in the Rye"?</b>

461
00:43:40,979 --> 00:43:42,255
<b>Yes.</b>

462
00:43:43,309 --> 00:43:45,685
<b>Oh, okay.</b>

463
00:43:45,849 --> 00:43:47,824
<b>I can run up there quickly.</b>

464
00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:50,125
<b>All right.</b>

465
00:43:57,629 --> 00:43:59,499
<b>What did he say? Where's the book?</b>

466
00:43:59,499 --> 00:44:01,559
<b>Is he bringing it here? What did he say? I'm in a hurry.</b>

467
00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:03,769
<b>Well, the thing is...</b>

468
00:44:03,769 --> 00:44:05,669
<b>Yes? What is it?</b>

469
00:44:05,669 --> 00:44:07,970
<b>Dad, I really don't want any more penalty points.</b>

470
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:09,240
<b>My life will end.</b>

471
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:10,945
<b>So what's the matter?</b>

472
00:44:11,169 --> 00:44:13,284
<b>It's in the mountains.</b>

473
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:14,579
<b>No way.</b>
