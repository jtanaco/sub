<b>Dr. Ahn, Sang-u is here.</b>

3
00:00:24,589 --> 00:00:28,134
<b>My goodness. Sang-u is here.</b>

4
00:00:28,218 --> 00:00:30,762
<b>Sang-u, say hello to the doctor.</b>

5
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:33,181
<b>All right. There you go.</b>

6
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,142
<b>Sang-u, you came with a shark today.</b>

7
00:00:36,726 --> 00:00:40,897
<b>Should I take a look
at what's inside the shark's mouth?</b>

8
00:00:41,814 --> 00:00:42,941
<b>Oh, no.</b>

9
00:00:43,233 --> 00:00:46,611
<b>Sang-u, why are you crying?</b>

10
00:00:46,903 --> 00:00:50,073
<b>The doctor is going to ease
your stomachache.</b>

11
00:00:50,156 --> 00:00:52,617
<b>He's trying to ease your stomachache.
Why are you crying?</b>

12
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:53,701
<b>Don't cry now.</b>

13
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:56,663
<b>If you keep crying,</b>

14

<b>this scary doctor is going to scold you
and give you a shot.</b>

15
00:01:01,376 --> 00:01:02,752
<b>Right, doctor?</b>

16
00:01:03,878 --> 00:01:06,089
<b>Bad boy! Where's the syringe?</b>

17
00:01:06,297 --> 00:01:09,717
<b>Nurse, where is the big syringe
Sang-u is going to get?</b>

18
00:01:09,801 --> 00:01:12,136
<b>Sang-u, be quiet. Stop crying.</b>

19
00:01:13,054 --> 00:01:16,558
<b>If you keep crying, the doctor
is going to bring a big syringe.</b>

20
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:18,351
<b>Stop.</b>

21
00:01:26,276 --> 00:01:29,696
<b>Let's see. I have some snacks
for Sang-u right here.</b>

<b>Oh, my goodness. Who scared Sang-u?</b>

23
00:01:32,824 --> 00:01:35,660
<b>Who scared my sweet boy, Sang-u?</b>

24
00:01:35,743 --> 00:01:37,120
<b>Was it the doctor?</b>

25
00:01:38,162 --> 00:01:40,164
<b>It was the doctor, right?</b>

26
00:01:40,248 --> 00:01:42,292
<b>I'll scold him for you.</b>

27
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:44,002
<b>There.</b>

28
00:01:45,169 --> 00:01:47,171
<b>I scolded a bad doctor for you.</b>

29
00:01:48,006 --> 00:01:51,926
<b>Doctor, why did you scare Sang-u?</b>

30
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:54,345
<b>He's such a nice boy.</b>

31
00:01:55,096 --> 00:01:58,391
<b>Doctor, you won't scare Sang-u
anymore, right?</b>

32
00:01:59,100 --> 00:01:59,976
<b>Right, doctor?</b>

33
00:02:03,896 --> 00:02:05,857
<b>I am sorry, Sang-u.</b>

34
00:02:06,441 --> 00:02:08,818
<b>I'll give you this snack
instead of a shot.</b>

35
00:02:08,985 --> 00:02:11,279
<b>Eat this when you're all better.</b>

36
00:02:11,362 --> 00:02:12,864
<b>-Yes.
-Professor Ahn.</b>

<b>Ji-su needs her PEG tube changed now.</b>

38
00:02:16,451 --> 00:02:19,495
<b>-Excuse me for a second, Sang-u.
-Yes.</b>

39
00:02:23,374 --> 00:02:24,751
<b>Hello.</b>

40
00:02:26,669 --> 00:02:29,088
<b>I took a look at your ultrasound.</b>

41
00:02:31,841 --> 00:02:33,885
<b>It will be difficult to treat
with antibiotics.</b>

42
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:36,387
<b>What does he have exactly?</b>

43
00:02:36,554 --> 00:02:38,890
<b>He has infective endocarditis.</b>

44
00:02:38,973 --> 00:02:41,142
<b>There's an infection in his endocardium.</b>

45
00:02:41,225 --> 00:02:44,312
<b>If we treat it with antibiotics,
you may suffer from embolism.</b>

46
00:02:44,729 --> 00:02:47,482
<b>I'm concerned an infected mass
might block your vessels.</b>

47
00:02:47,565 --> 00:02:50,193
<b>You must get surgery as soon as possible.
Did you find him a bed?</b>

48
00:02:50,276 --> 00:02:51,986
<b>Yes, he can get checked in after 6 p.m.</b>

49
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:54,864
<b>Check in today and let's book
the surgery as soon as we can.</b>

50
00:02:55,448 --> 00:02:57,116
<b>-Is it serious?
-Yes.</b>

51
00:03:00,203 --> 00:03:01,663
<b>If the infected mass is small,</b>

52
00:03:01,746 --> 00:03:03,831
<b>antibiotics can be used to break it down.</b>

53
00:03:03,915 --> 00:03:07,001
<b>From your ultrasound, the infected mass
is big and dangling.</b>

54
00:03:07,085 --> 00:03:08,753
<b>We can't tell when it will fall off.</b>

55
00:03:09,295 --> 00:03:11,172
<b>If it goes to the brain,
it causes a stroke.</b>

56
00:03:11,255 --> 00:03:13,007
<b>If it goes to the heart,
it causes a heart attack.</b>

57
00:03:13,091 --> 00:03:14,967
<b>You need to have surgery soon.</b>

58
00:03:15,593 --> 00:03:17,679
<b>Do we have an opening for surgery
in two or three days?</b>

59
00:03:17,762 --> 00:03:20,556
<b>No, we're full.
There's no opening this week.</b>

60
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,726
<b>We'll do it in the morning if we must.
Call Anesthesiology</b>

61
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:26,521
<b>and ask them to help me
with the surgery in two or three days.</b>

62
00:03:27,105 --> 00:03:28,022
<b>Okay.</b>

63
00:03:28,106 --> 00:03:32,568
<b>Doctor, my daughter
is getting married in three days.</b>

64
00:03:33,152 --> 00:03:35,071
<b>Can we postpone the surgery
until next week?</b>

65
00:03:35,655 --> 00:03:36,698
<b>No, we cannot.</b>

66
00:03:37,281 --> 00:03:39,450
<b>It's only for a couple of days.</b>

67
00:03:40,243 --> 00:03:42,870
<b>-Wouldn't that be okay?
-No.</b>

68
00:03:42,954 --> 00:03:44,914
<b>Only if you want to end your life.</b>

69
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,376
<b>Dad, what are you talking about?
Don't be foolish.</b>

70
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,545
<b>My wedding isn't what's important now.</b>

71
00:03:51,212 --> 00:03:52,964
<b>You can look at the wedding photos.</b>

72
00:03:53,047 --> 00:03:54,674
<b>Ask her to take lots of photos.</b>

73
00:03:55,299 --> 00:03:58,010
<b>Then I'll see you tomorrow
during my rounds.</b>

74
00:04:00,054 --> 00:04:02,223
<b>Let me go over what you need to do.</b>

75
00:04:03,683 --> 00:04:06,602
<b>First, head to the left
and have your blood sample drawn.</b>

76
00:04:06,686 --> 00:04:08,563
<b>Why is that doctor so rude?</b>

77
00:04:09,605 --> 00:04:11,941
<b>I am sorry. We are well aware of that.</b>

78
00:04:13,359 --> 00:04:14,986
<b>Second, get an EKG from the room</b>

79
00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:17,780
<b>right next to where you have
your blood sample drawn.</b>

80
00:04:17,864 --> 00:04:19,157
<b>-And third...
-Well...</b>

81
00:04:19,449 --> 00:04:21,784
<b>Aged 78. His name is Im Gi-yeong.</b>

82
00:04:21,868 --> 00:04:24,454
<b>He underwent coiling a month ago
due to an SAH.</b>

83
00:04:25,329 --> 00:04:27,790
<b>He showed symptoms of leg weakness
and dementia three days ago</b>

84
00:04:27,874 --> 00:04:29,292
<b>so he was readmitted.</b>

85
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:31,711
<b>His CT scan revealed that
he has hydrocephalus.</b>

86
00:04:32,795 --> 00:04:36,466
<b>It seems the IVH that was accompanied
by SAH is gone for now.</b>

87
00:04:36,549 --> 00:04:37,467
<b>EVD...</b>

88
00:04:40,094 --> 00:04:41,387
<b>That's not it. I'm sorry.</b>

89
00:04:43,473 --> 00:04:45,391
<b>I think we should perform a VP shunt.</b>

90
00:04:45,892 --> 00:04:47,935
<b>Shouldn't you have that memorized by now?</b>

91
00:04:48,561 --> 00:04:49,771
<b>You're right.</b>

92
00:04:50,521 --> 00:04:52,732
<b>-Are you sure he needs a VP shunt?
-Yes.</b>

93
00:04:55,234 --> 00:04:56,444
<b>No.</b>

94
00:04:57,653 --> 00:05:00,281
<b>-Is he wrong?
-Yes, I think so.</b>

95
00:05:01,073 --> 00:05:03,201
<b>Really? I think he's right.</b>

96
00:05:06,621 --> 00:05:08,456
<b>You have until my next round.</b>

97
00:05:08,539 --> 00:05:10,875
<b>Prepare a summary of relevant papers
and surgical cases.</b>

98
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:11,959
<b>Okay.</b>

99

<b>-You, too.
-Okay.</b>

<b>We got a new restaurant to deliver to us.</b>

102
00:05:23,971 --> 00:05:25,723
<b>-Which one?
-A seafood stew restaurant.</b>

103
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,475
<b>That's too much for delivery food.</b>

104

<b>They also do a wonderful <i>haemulpajeon.</i></b>

<b>Go ahead without me.

00:08:29,198 --> 00:08:30,408
<b>I'm on my way.</b>

162
00:08:41,752 --> 00:08:44,005
<b>-Will they perform the surgery here?
-Yes.</b>

163
00:08:44,922 --> 00:08:48,467
<b>It's more dangerous to move the patient

<b>-Pay attention.
-Okay.</b>

168

<b>Professor,</b>

169
00:09:11,157 --> 00:09:13,492
<b>-is this surgery difficult?
-The baby will live, right?</b>

170
00:09:13,576 --> 00:09:16,370
<b>Four days ago, he had a TGA,
transposition of the great arteries.</b>

171
00:09:16,454 --> 00:09:18,789
<b>His heart swelling was too severe.
I couldn't close him up.</b>

172
00:09:21,584 --> 00:09:25,004
<b>Seeing his heart today, I might
be able to close him. So, I'll do it now.</b>

173
00:09:25,963 --> 00:09:27,298
<b>He will live, right?</b>

174
00:09:27,381 --> 00:09:29,258
<b>I'm closing him up

175
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:32,344
<b>Jae-hak, bring them in.</b>

176
00:09:33,471 --> 00:09:34,305
<b>Pardon?</b>

177
00:09:35,139 --> 00:09:36,182
<b>I see. Okay.</b>

178
00:09:42,813 --> 00:09:45,066
<b>What do you think you're doing?
You'll contaminate him.</b>

179
00:09:46,984 --> 00:09:47,985
<b>Do you have a death wish?</b>

180
00:09:49,528 --> 00:09:50,446
<b>He means the guardians.</b>

181
00:09:59,622 --> 00:10:02,374
<b>Sir, Chan-hyeong has a slight fever.</b>

182
00:10:04,585 --> 00:10:05,711
<b>Since when?</b>

183
00:10:06,253 --> 00:10:08,589
<b>When I checked at 8 a.m., it was 36°C.</b>

184
00:10:08,672 --> 00:10:11,634
<b>I checked again just now and it's
38.3°C. His nose is a little runny, too.</b>

185
00:10:13,094 --> 00:10:15,971
<b>-Can we perform the surgery today?
-Let me see him.</b>

186
00:10:26,857 --> 00:10:29,652
<b>His lung doesn't sound good, either.
We can't operate on him like this.</b>

187
00:10:30,402 --> 00:10:32,863
<b>Give me five minutes.
Remove the membrane for me.</b>

188
00:10:33,781 --> 00:10:35,449
<b>Can I touch the baby?</b>

189
00:10:35,533 --> 00:10:36,909
<b>-I disinfected my hands.
-Okay.</b>

190
00:10:44,834 --> 00:10:47,461
<b>What's wrong with this baby?</b>

191
00:10:47,545 --> 00:10:50,422
<b>Jae-hak, get Chan-hyeong's guardians now.</b>

192
00:10:51,298 --> 00:10:53,717
<b>He has Tetralogy of Fallot.
It's a congenital heart defect.</b>

193
00:10:53,801 --> 00:10:56,178
<b>He has a ventricular septal defect,
pulmonary stenosis,</b>

194

<b>right ventricular hypertrophy,
and overriding aorta, all together.</b>

195
00:10:59,515 --> 00:11:01,433
<b>We were scheduled to operate
this afternoon.</b>

196
00:11:01,517 --> 00:11:04,103
<b>His oxygen saturation
is a little low, though.</b>

197
00:11:05,104 --> 00:11:06,897
<b>He's showing symptoms of pneumonia.</b>

198
00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:11,026
<b>He needs this surgery as soon as possible.</b>

199

<b>Flex.</b>

202
00:11:30,366 --> 00:11:31,867
<b>I have bad news.</b>

203
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:34,578
<b>We need to postpone the surgery
by a day or two.</b>

204
00:11:35,371 --> 00:11:37,331
<b>He has a fever
and his lung doesn't sound good.</b>

205
00:11:37,414 --> 00:11:40,542
<b>I plan to reschedule after taking
an X-ray of his lungs.</b>

206
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,462
<b>He's still finding it hard to breathe.</b>

207
00:11:43,545 --> 00:11:46,423
<b>He might be in more pain
if we rush into surgery.</b>

208
00:11:47,383 --> 00:11:48,717
<b>We'll do that, then.</b>

209
00:11:50,427 --> 00:11:53,263
<b>If it's a mild case of pneumonia,
he'll recover in two to three days.</b>

210
00:11:53,347 --> 00:11:55,057
<b>We'll observe him for a few days.</b>

211
00:11:57,226 --> 00:11:58,602
<b>Do you have any questions?</b>

212
00:11:59,603 --> 00:12:00,479
<b>No.</b>

213
00:12:03,023 --> 00:12:05,651
<b>You'll reschedule the surgery
and let us know, right?</b>

214
00:12:06,318 --> 00:12:08,237
<b>We know. You explained already.</b>

215
00:12:09,613 --> 00:12:10,531
<b>Okay, then.</b>

216
00:12:13,742 --> 00:12:17,371
<b>My gosh, they seem so composed.
Their son's life is at stake.</b>

217
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:20,999
<b>They are just immature.
Did you see how young his mother is?</b>

218
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:22,167
<b>She was born in 2000.</b>

219
00:12:22,751 --> 00:12:24,378
<b>I like that she's calm.</b>

220
00:12:25,045 --> 00:12:28,090
<b>Do you think it's possible
that she's not herself right now</b>

221
00:12:28,173 --> 00:12:31,093
<b>because of the pressure she's under

<b>She's still very young.</b>

223
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:35,889
<b>Maybe she's having trouble

<b>-Jae-hak.

<b>He's lucky he's a doctor.

<b>Hey, what is this?</b>

596
00:33:25,262 --> 00:33:27,014
<b>This is a recommendation letter
for priests.</b>

597
00:33:27,098 --> 00:33:28,057
<b>Right?</b>

598
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,934
<b>-It's for real this time, right?
-Yes.</b>

599
00:33:30,017 --> 00:33:31,727
<b>I feel bad for Jeong-won's mother.</b>

600
00:33:32,269 --> 00:33:33,813
<b>Same. That jerk.</b>

601
00:33:35,147 --> 00:33:36,982
<b>-Is it Jeong-won?
-No, it's my wife.</b>

602
00:33:37,066 --> 00:33:38,526
<b>Your wife? You have a wife?</b>

603
00:33:40,277 --> 00:33:41,278
<b>Yes, I have a wife.</b>

604
00:33:41,362 --> 00:33:43,531
<b>The ambitious Ms. Yuk Hye-jeong?</b>

605
00:33:43,614 --> 00:33:45,408
<b>She's so busy, I'll forget her face
pretty soon.</b>

606
00:33:45,491 --> 00:33:46,325
<b>That's enough.</b>

607
00:33:46,409 --> 00:33:48,994
<b>Hey, honey. It's been so long!</b>

608
00:33:50,454 --> 00:33:51,664
<b>What time is it over there?</b>

609
00:33:52,581 --> 00:33:53,582
<b>Okay.</b>

610
00:33:54,834 --> 00:33:56,127
<b>Is your marathon course here?</b>

611
00:33:56,794 --> 00:33:59,088
<b>-Tell me which hole this room counts as.
-Yes.</b>

612
00:34:01,215 --> 00:34:02,133
<b>Okay.</b>

613
00:34:02,216 --> 00:34:03,801
<b>-It's his wife.
-Okay.</b>

614
00:34:04,385 --> 00:34:05,428
<b>-Really?
-Okay. Sure.</b>

615
00:34:05,511 --> 00:34:07,346
<b>Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.</b>

616
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,765
<b>She's coming back tomorrow.</b>

617
00:34:09,849 --> 00:34:11,642
<b>She's coming straight to the hospital
because she misses me.</b>

618
00:34:11,726 --> 00:34:13,644
<b>It's because it's Children's Day
in two days.</b>

619
00:34:14,061 --> 00:34:16,439
<b>-Has it been a year since you saw her?
-A year and a half.</b>

620
00:34:16,522 --> 00:34:19,066
<b>She should've been here
for her mom's anniversary at least.</b>

621
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,819
<b>Whatever! That's not my business.</b>

622
00:34:21,902 --> 00:34:23,487
<b>Gosh, Yuk Hye-jeong.</b>

623
00:34:23,571 --> 00:34:26,115
<b>She's my friend
and I was the one who set him up with her.</b>

624
00:34:26,198 --> 00:34:29,493
<b>I have never seen anyone
who is as ambitious as she is.</b>

625
00:34:30,035 --> 00:34:31,912
<b>I've never seen you
badmouth anyone either.</b>

626
00:34:31,996 --> 00:34:34,165
<b>Stop it. She's my wife.
And she's U-ju's mother.</b>

627
00:34:34,248 --> 00:34:36,083
<b>The virgin and the bachelor
should shut it.</b>

628
00:34:36,167 --> 00:34:38,085
<b>That's such an outdated term.
A "bachelor."</b>

629
00:34:38,169 --> 00:34:40,629
<b>Hey, Jeong-won. What is this?</b>

630
00:34:45,259 --> 00:34:47,094
<b>Are you really going to quit
to become a priest?</b>

631
00:34:47,887 --> 00:34:50,181
<b>-Did you RSVP?
-Is that important right now?</b>

632
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,308
<b>Listen. If you...</b>

633
00:34:53,517 --> 00:34:54,560
<b>Hey, Gyeo-ul.</b>

634
00:34:55,603 --> 00:34:58,355
<b>Of course.
I collected a lot of those. Yes.</b>

635
00:34:58,439 --> 00:35:00,441
<b>-Okay. I got it.
-When is it?</b>

636
00:35:00,524 --> 00:35:02,359
<b>-Did you talk to the director?
-Okay.</b>

637
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:04,195
<b>I'll tell him next week.</b>

638
00:35:05,196 --> 00:35:07,239
<b>I won't be leaving right away.</b>

639
00:35:07,656 --> 00:35:09,950
<b>I'll stay until the end of the year
and resign then.</b>

640
00:35:11,243 --> 00:35:12,870
<b>I'm going to go see Gyeo-ul.</b>

641
00:35:13,662 --> 00:35:14,997
<b>Seriously. Wait.</b>

642
00:35:16,832 --> 00:35:19,585
<b>Look over here. Look at the camera.</b>

643
00:35:20,127 --> 00:35:21,837
<b>One, two, three.</b>

644
00:35:22,588 --> 00:35:24,381
<b>-What was that?
-What are you doing?</b>

645
00:35:24,507 --> 00:35:27,885
<b>Jeong-won will leave us soon.
We should leave lots of photos behind.</b>

646
00:35:28,302 --> 00:35:29,929
<b>-Bye.
-What the...</b>

647
00:35:33,098 --> 00:35:35,392
<b>Is he having an affair with Gyeo-ul?</b>

648
00:35:55,746 --> 00:35:57,039
<b>Don't you have a photo of him alone?</b>

649
00:35:57,623 --> 00:36:00,251
<b>Give me some time.
I'm waiting for the right time.</b>

650
00:36:00,459 --> 00:36:02,670
<b>But Jeong-won catches on really fast.</b>

651
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:05,840
<b>Did you ask him about me?
What does he think of me?</b>

652
00:36:06,257 --> 00:36:08,217
<b>-Not yet.
-Why not?</b>

653
00:36:09,009 --> 00:36:10,886
<b>It'd be too obvious. Is that okay?</b>

654
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:13,138
<b>Yes. I don't mind.</b>

655
00:36:13,222 --> 00:36:15,558
<b>So, please ask him what he thinks of me.</b>

656
00:36:15,641 --> 00:36:17,810
<b>Why don't you tell him you like him then?</b>

657
00:36:20,354 --> 00:36:21,188
<b>That's too...</b>

658
00:36:23,023 --> 00:36:24,900
<b>-I'm too shy to do that.
-Gosh.</b>

659
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,528
<b>-But you're not shy talking to me?
-No.</b>

660
00:36:29,196 --> 00:36:32,783
<b>Okay, fine. I'll be extra sneaky</b>

661
00:36:32,867 --> 00:36:34,910
<b>and ask him what he thinks of you.</b>

662
00:36:34,994 --> 00:36:37,663
<b>I'm doing this
because I think highly of your courage.</b>

663
00:36:43,168 --> 00:36:45,421
<b>This is <i>yukjeon.</i> It's from Gwangju.</b>

664
00:36:45,504 --> 00:36:48,716
<b>Oh, my. Are you serious? <i>Yukjeon?</i></b>

665
00:36:54,346 --> 00:36:56,140
<b>Why do you like Jeong-won so much?</b>

666
00:36:57,474 --> 00:36:58,726
<b>Everything.</b>

667
00:36:59,351 --> 00:37:00,644
<b>Do you need water?</b>

668
00:37:01,562 --> 00:37:02,730
<b>I'm fine.</b>

669
00:37:04,315 --> 00:37:05,232
<b>Gyeo-ul.</b>

670
00:37:06,358 --> 00:37:08,986
<b>I think you have this fantasy
about Jeong-won.</b>

671
00:37:09,445 --> 00:37:12,781
<b>The way he treats people at the hospital</b>

672
00:37:12,865 --> 00:37:15,075
<b>and the way he behaves around us
are very different.</b>

673
00:37:15,159 --> 00:37:17,870
<b>What is he like?
I want to hear everything.</b>

674
00:37:18,579 --> 00:37:20,080
<b>He's so sensitive.</b>

675
00:37:20,831 --> 00:37:23,459
<b>He loses sleep for a month
if something goes wrong with his patient.</b>

676
00:37:24,251 --> 00:37:25,461
<b>He's so humanitarian.</b>

677
00:37:25,544 --> 00:37:28,088
<b>And he's extremely stubborn.</b>

678
00:37:28,172 --> 00:37:29,256
<b>He is a man of principles.</b>

679
00:37:29,757 --> 00:37:31,675
<b>And he's not rich. He's dirt poor.</b>

680
00:37:31,759 --> 00:37:33,344
<b>He mooches off Jun-wan.</b>

681
00:37:33,928 --> 00:37:35,346
<b>Isn't that <i>noblesse oblige?</i></b>

682
00:37:35,846 --> 00:37:37,556
<b>Are we playing a game of antonyms?</b>

683
00:37:39,016 --> 00:37:41,644
<b>What else? Tell me everything.</b>

684
00:37:43,687 --> 00:37:45,230
<b>Most importantly, he...</b>

685
00:37:46,732 --> 00:37:47,650
<b>Gosh.</b>

686
00:37:48,734 --> 00:37:49,944
<b>Dating...</b>

687
00:37:50,027 --> 00:37:52,071
<b>No. He's not interested in women.</b>

688
00:37:52,655 --> 00:37:55,574
<b>I have never seen him with a girl, ever.</b>

689
00:37:59,161 --> 00:38:00,537
<b>This is for your ears only.</b>

690
00:38:01,538 --> 00:38:03,457
<b>Jeong-won is interested in something else.</b>

691
00:38:03,999 --> 00:38:05,459
<b>Is he a sexual minority?</b>

692
00:38:06,043 --> 00:38:09,046
<b>Jeez. Not like that. I mean
he wants to be a man of God.</b>

693
00:38:09,129 --> 00:38:10,839
<b>Not pride. A priest.</b>

694
00:38:11,382 --> 00:38:12,883
<b>I doubt that.</b>

695
00:38:13,801 --> 00:38:15,219
<b>I hope so, too.</b>

696
00:38:17,221 --> 00:38:20,265
<b>I know that Professor Ahn
is a devout Catholic.</b>

697
00:38:20,349 --> 00:38:23,060
<b>All his brothers are priests,
and his sisters are nuns.</b>

698
00:38:24,061 --> 00:38:26,355
<b>But he's not a priest yet.</b>

699
00:38:27,189 --> 00:38:28,315
<b>He just wants to be one.</b>

700
00:38:29,149 --> 00:38:32,027
<b>Then I still have a chance.</b>

701
00:38:32,569 --> 00:38:34,238
<b>Ik-jun, give me a cigarette.</b>

702
00:38:45,207 --> 00:38:46,583
<b>Not with Gyeo-ul of all people.</b>

703
00:38:48,961 --> 00:38:51,964
<b>You prick, you'd better come

<b>What are you thinking? You're married.</b>

705
00:38:59,722 --> 00:39:00,723
<b>What?</b>

706
00:39:00,806 --> 00:39:02,516
<b>What do you think of Gyeo-ul?</b>

707
00:39:03,851 --> 00:39:06,562
<b>-What?
-What do you think of her?</b>

708
00:39:15,279 --> 00:39:17,197
<b>YULJE MEDICAL CENTER</b>

<b>Dad. Be strong in there, okay?</b>

719
00:40:12,086 --> 00:40:14,004
<b>Everything will be fine. Don't worry.</b>

<b>My sweetheart.</b>

<b>I can't come to your wedding

<b>I am so sorry, sweetie.</b>

724
00:40:28,393 --> 00:40:31,980
<b>Why are you sorry? I am sorry, Dad.</b>

725

<b>How could I get married when you're sick?</b>

726
00:40:37,194 --> 00:40:38,403
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

727
00:40:55,629 --> 00:40:56,839
<b>Hello.</b>

728
00:40:58,215 --> 00:41:00,926
<b>We're going to move
the patient into the OR now.</b>

729
00:41:02,386 --> 00:41:04,012
<b>How have you been?</b>

730
00:41:04,888 --> 00:41:06,265
<b>How are you feeling?</b>

731
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:09,017
<b>Let me explain about the surgery.</b>

732
00:41:09,101 --> 00:41:11,019
<b>As I told you,
I'll remove the infected mass</b>

733
00:41:11,103 --> 00:41:13,230
<b>and mold the area
with the leftover tissue.</b>

734
00:41:13,313 --> 00:41:15,524
<b>It will take about five hours.</b>

735
00:41:15,607 --> 00:41:18,026
<b>But it could be longer
if there's a complication.</b>

736
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:21,989
<b>Doctor, you've done
this surgery many times, right?</b>

00:41:22,072 --> 00:41:23,198
<b>Yes.</b>

738
00:41:23,699 --> 00:41:26,201
<b>Then, we don't have
to worry too much, right?</b>

739
00:41:26,493 --> 00:41:29,329
<b>This surgery isn't life-threatening
or anything, right?</b>

740
00:41:29,413 --> 00:41:30,789
<b>I cannot guarantee that.</b>

741
00:41:30,873 --> 00:41:33,333
<b>There are a lot of variables

742
00:41:34,501 --> 00:41:35,335
<b>Oh, no.</b>

743
00:41:35,419 --> 00:41:36,837
<b>However, I will do my best.</b>

744
00:41:44,511 --> 00:41:45,762
<b>Jeez.</b>

745
00:41:47,347 --> 00:41:50,517
<b>You should have just told them

00:41:51,518 --> 00:41:53,896
<b>The patient's daughter
is getting married today.</b>

747
00:41:54,271 --> 00:41:56,523
<b>The whole family
must already feel bad for each other.</b>

748
00:41:57,065 --> 00:41:59,109
<b>You should have been nicer to them.</b>

749
00:42:00,652 --> 00:42:01,862
<b>You could have just told them</b>

750
00:42:02,404 --> 00:42:05,365
<b>that the surgery will be successful,
so they have nothing to worry about.</b>

751
00:42:05,449 --> 00:42:07,451
<b>Couldn't you just say that?</b>

752
00:42:09,411 --> 00:42:11,288
<b>This surgery isn't that difficult for you.</b>

753
00:42:13,081 --> 00:42:15,667
<b>What if the patient has
periannular abscess?</b>

754
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:19,421
<b>What if he has brain damage
from an embolism during surgery?</b>

755
00:42:19,504 --> 00:42:22,049
<b>But the chance of that happening
is very low.</b>

756
00:42:23,342 --> 00:42:24,593
<b>He has no feelings.</b>

757
00:42:24,676 --> 00:42:26,803
<b>How do feelings help with surgery?</b>

758
00:42:26,887 --> 00:42:28,889
<b>I'll be emotional if it helps,
but it doesn't.</b>

759
00:42:29,514 --> 00:42:30,432
<b>It doesn't help at all.</b>

760
00:42:31,433 --> 00:42:32,476
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

761
00:42:32,559 --> 00:42:34,311
<b>Never talk to the patients
like that again.</b>

762
00:42:34,811 --> 00:42:36,313
<b>"It's a simple surgery. You will live.</b>

763
00:42:36,396 --> 00:42:39,066
<b>This surgery will go well.
Don't worry about anything."</b>

764
00:42:41,068 --> 00:42:42,694
<b>Don't. Got it?</b>

765
00:42:44,112 --> 00:42:45,072
<b>Yes.</b>

766
00:42:56,458 --> 00:42:59,253
<b>YULJE MEDICAL CENTER</b>

767
00:43:02,464 --> 00:43:05,467
<b>One iced Americano
with three shots, please.</b>

768
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:07,219
<b>-Hello, Professor Kim.
-Hello.</b>

769
00:43:07,302 --> 00:43:10,347
<b>You guys are here early.
A piece of chocolate cake, too.</b>

770
00:43:11,473 --> 00:43:13,600
<b>We've been here
since eight in the morning.</b>

771
00:43:13,684 --> 00:43:16,603
<b>Is that so? That's impressive.</b>

772
00:43:17,104 --> 00:43:18,230
<b>-Pay with this.
-What?</b>

773
00:43:18,605 --> 00:43:20,190
<b>-Thank you.
-Thank you.</b>

774
00:43:22,776 --> 00:43:24,528
<b>Dr. Do is good to you, right?</b>

775
00:43:24,778 --> 00:43:26,321
<b>Yes, he's really nice.</b>

776
00:43:26,405 --> 00:43:28,448
<b>Goodness. I'm glad to hear that.</b>

777
00:43:28,532 --> 00:43:31,326
<b>Can I ask you
why you chose Cardiothoracic Surgery?</b>

778
00:43:32,869 --> 00:43:35,914
<b>It's our assignment to do an interview.
We've asked another professor as well.</b>

779
00:43:35,998 --> 00:43:36,832
<b>Who?</b>

780
00:43:36,915 --> 00:43:40,335
<b>We've just started,
so we've only interviewed one professor.</b>

781
00:43:40,419 --> 00:43:42,546
<b>It's Professor Chae Song-hwa
of Neurosurgery.</b>

782
00:43:43,213 --> 00:43:44,339
<b>What did she say?</b>

783
00:43:44,923 --> 00:43:47,551
<b>She chose Neurosurgery
because she wanted to study.</b>

784
00:43:47,634 --> 00:43:49,511
<b>There is still a lot to study
in her field.</b>

785
00:43:49,594 --> 00:43:51,930
<b>I know. No one knows it better than I do.</b>

786
00:43:52,014 --> 00:43:53,348
<b>What about you, sir?</b>

787
00:43:55,267 --> 00:43:57,769
<b>Me? I went to an Internet cafe</b>

788
00:43:57,853 --> 00:44:00,355
<b>and a cardiothoracic surgeon I sat next to
told me to choose CS.</b>

789
00:44:03,275 --> 00:44:05,360
<b>-Professor, please.
-I'm serious.</b>

790
00:44:05,444 --> 00:44:07,571
<b>I was asked whether
I wanted to make money or teach.</b>

791
00:44:07,654 --> 00:44:09,573
<b>I said I'd prefer to teach</b>

792
00:44:09,656 --> 00:44:10,782
<b>and he told me to choose CS.</b>

793
00:44:11,491 --> 00:44:12,492
<b>That's why I'm here.</b>

794
00:44:13,368 --> 00:44:14,369
<b>I see.</b>

795
00:44:15,912 --> 00:44:18,081
<b>May I have this chocolate cake?</b>

796
00:44:18,165 --> 00:44:19,166
<b>No, you may not.</b>

797
00:44:22,169 --> 00:44:24,338
<b>-Just get one more.
-Okay.</b>

798
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,932
<b>Irrigation is very important.
You know that, right?</b>

799
00:44:36,016 --> 00:44:38,393
<b>-Yes.
-Why is it important?</b>

800
00:44:42,647 --> 00:44:43,648
<b>Well...</b>

801
00:44:44,733 --> 00:44:46,068
<b>Through the microscope,</b>

802
00:44:46,151 --> 00:44:48,987
<b>you can see
that it's close to the optic nerve.</b>

803
00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:53,700
<b>So, a bipolar cautery
can cause thermal injuries,</b>

804
00:44:53,784 --> 00:44:56,828
<b>which can result in loss of vision
after the surgery.</b>

805
00:45:06,213 --> 00:45:09,716
<b>Ms. Nam, we should operate
on Chan-hyeong tomorrow.</b>

806
00:45:10,217 --> 00:45:13,762
<b>Yes. His lung sounds have improved,
and the X-rays look much better.</b>

807
00:45:13,845 --> 00:45:16,056
<b>Yes. It will be hard for him
if we keep putting it off.</b>

808
00:45:16,139 --> 00:45:17,766
<b>His guardians are here, right?</b>

809
00:45:17,849 --> 00:45:19,393
<b>Yes, I'll go bring them in.</b>

810
00:45:23,313 --> 00:45:25,440
<b>Jae-hak, do you happen
to have a suit here?</b>

811
00:45:25,524 --> 00:45:27,526
<b>Yes, I always keep one at the office.</b>

812
00:45:27,609 --> 00:45:28,985
<b>Can I borrow it?</b>

813
00:45:30,028 --> 00:45:31,988
<b>-They went home.
-What?</b>

814
00:45:32,572 --> 00:45:35,409
<b>They went home,
when their child is that sick?</b>

815
00:45:35,659 --> 00:45:36,910
<b>How can that be possible?</b>

816
00:45:36,993 --> 00:45:39,538
<b>Chan-hyeong's mom went home for a bit.</b>

817
00:45:39,871 --> 00:45:42,332
<b>Both of his grandmothers are here though.</b>

818
00:45:42,416 --> 00:45:44,042
<b>They should be in the lounge.</b>

819
00:45:45,961 --> 00:45:47,003
<b>Shall I go bring them in?</b>

820
00:45:47,087 --> 00:45:48,296
<b>Yes, please.</b>

821
00:45:49,548 --> 00:45:51,508
<b>We've been postponing the surgery
due to pneumonia,</b>

822
00:45:51,591 --> 00:45:53,969
<b>but the fever has gone down,
and so has the CRP.</b>

823
00:45:54,052 --> 00:45:55,470
<b>I think now would be the best time.</b>

824
00:45:55,762 --> 00:45:59,224
<b>Is the operation dangerous, doctor?</b>

825
00:45:59,307 --> 00:46:01,435
<b>-Are you his grandmother?
-I'm his maternal grandmother.</b>

826
00:46:01,518 --> 00:46:03,103
<b>-This is his paternal grandmother.
-I see.</b>

827
00:46:03,186 --> 00:46:06,314
<b>For now, please be informed that
we will operate tomorrow afternoon.</b>

828
00:46:06,398 --> 00:46:09,651
<b>When his parents are back,
I'll walk them through the details.</b>

829
00:46:09,734 --> 00:46:12,904
<b>You can just tell us instead.</b>

830
00:46:12,988 --> 00:46:14,614
<b>His mom is only 20.</b>

831
00:46:14,698 --> 00:46:16,450
<b>She's clueless because she's so young.</b>

832
00:46:16,533 --> 00:46:18,243
<b>The same goes for my son.</b>

833
00:46:18,326 --> 00:46:20,495
<b>That's right.
You can just tell us, doctor.</b>

834
00:46:20,579 --> 00:46:22,205
<b>Then I'll speak to all of you later.</b>

835
00:46:22,289 --> 00:46:24,124
<b>His mom is still his legal guardian.</b>

836
00:46:24,207 --> 00:46:25,167
<b>I'll see you then.</b>

837
00:46:30,255 --> 00:46:32,924
<b>You can talk
to the grandmothers, professor.</b>

838
00:46:33,008 --> 00:46:36,636
<b>I'll go over everything with his mom
and get the consent form signed.</b>

839
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,305
<b>Don't overlook a single detail.</b>

840
00:46:38,388 --> 00:46:40,056
<b>-Your suit is at the office?
-Yes.</b>

841
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:41,391
<b>-What color is it?
-Color?</b>

842
00:46:41,475 --> 00:46:43,602
<b>Yes, what color is your suit?</b>

843
00:46:44,394 --> 00:46:46,396
<b>Are you worried that it might be silver?</b>

844
00:47:16,968 --> 00:47:18,261
<b>Jun-wan, are you...</b>

845
00:47:19,137 --> 00:47:20,263
<b>Oh, boy.</b>

846
00:47:20,847 --> 00:47:22,140
<b>Don't say anything.</b>

847
00:47:22,224 --> 00:47:23,225
<b>Okay.</b>

848
00:47:26,478 --> 00:47:28,647
<b>Are you not going to have lunch?
I'm hungry.</b>

849
00:47:28,772 --> 00:47:30,065
<b>How about braised hairtail fish?</b>

850
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:34,236
<b>I suddenly got a craving for it
for some reason.</b>

851
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:36,404
<b>I have to go out. I'm meeting someone.</b>

852
00:47:36,821 --> 00:47:37,989
<b>What are you going to eat?</b>

853
00:47:38,198 --> 00:47:39,324
<b>Steak.</b>

854
00:47:39,407 --> 00:47:41,243
<b>Gosh, I don't like steak.</b>

855
00:47:46,748 --> 00:47:49,918
<b>Shall I eat out, too? It's been a while.</b>

856
00:47:53,755 --> 00:47:55,131
<b>Hello. This is Ahn Jeong-won.</b>

857
00:47:56,091 --> 00:47:57,801
<b>Okay, I'll be right there.</b>

858
00:47:58,301 --> 00:47:59,594
<b>Gosh.</b>

859
00:47:59,844 --> 00:48:02,055
<b>Chi-hong, can you wrap this up for me?</b>

860
00:48:02,138 --> 00:48:03,098
<b>Sure.</b>

861
00:48:11,273 --> 00:48:13,275
<b>You have to insert the Hemovac first.</b>

862
00:48:13,608 --> 00:48:14,568
<b>Yes.</b>

863
00:48:19,155 --> 00:48:20,991
<b>Are you going to keep breaking it?</b>

864
00:48:21,575 --> 00:48:23,577
<b>Control your strength. Be gentle with it.</b>

865
00:48:25,078 --> 00:48:26,162
<b>Okay. I'm sorry.</b>

866
00:48:27,330 --> 00:48:28,790
<b>I'll stop talking.</b>

867
00:48:28,873 --> 00:48:30,417
<b>You should focus. I'm sorry.</b>

868
00:48:30,792 --> 00:48:31,793
<b>It's okay.</b>

869
00:48:33,628 --> 00:48:34,796
<b>Mr. Yuk Hui-gwan.</b>

870
00:48:35,046 --> 00:48:37,173
<b>-Congratulations. You can go home now.
-Thank you.</b>

871
00:48:37,257 --> 00:48:39,301
<b>Your surgical wound has been disinfected</b>

872
00:48:39,384 --> 00:48:40,885
<b>and wrapped in waterproof bandage.</b>

873
00:48:40,969 --> 00:48:42,637
<b>You can take a shower right away.</b>

874
00:48:42,721 --> 00:48:46,474
<b>As for food, you can eat normally
but please try not to overeat.</b>

875
00:48:46,558 --> 00:48:48,518
<b>Mom, can you transform this?</b>

876
00:48:48,602 --> 00:48:50,729
<b>In a bit, Won-jun. Give me a minute.</b>

877
00:48:51,313 --> 00:48:53,523
<b>You have an appointment booked
in a week from now.</b>

878
00:48:53,607 --> 00:48:55,233
<b>The biopsy results will be available then.</b>

879
00:48:55,317 --> 00:48:57,861
<b>If you need the diagnosis
for your insurance, just let us know.</b>

880
00:48:57,944 --> 00:48:59,654
<b>-Okay, thank you.
-Thank you.</b>

881
00:48:59,738 --> 00:49:03,074
<b>Hurry, Mom. I want this
transformed into the robot.</b>

882
00:49:04,159 --> 00:49:07,120
<b>Is Dr. Lee Ik-jun doing rounds today
by any chance?</b>

883
00:49:07,203 --> 00:49:09,372
<b>I haven't had a chance
to thank him properly.</b>

884
00:49:09,456 --> 00:49:10,665
<b>He did such an excellent job.</b>

885
00:49:10,749 --> 00:49:12,000
<b>Won-jun!</b>

886
00:49:13,168 --> 00:49:15,337
<b>-Hello, Dr. Lee.
-Yes, hello.</b>

887
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:17,213
<b>Give me that. I'll do it for you.</b>

888
00:49:17,339 --> 00:49:18,840
<b>My gosh.</b>

889
00:49:18,965 --> 00:49:22,552
<b>Mr. Yuk, you don't even
look like a patient without your IV drip.</b>

890
00:49:22,636 --> 00:49:23,678
<b>You're handsome.</b>

891
00:49:23,762 --> 00:49:24,804
<b>Gosh, I'm flattered.</b>

892
00:49:24,888 --> 00:49:26,848
<b>You remembered his name.</b>

893
00:49:26,931 --> 00:49:28,433
<b>You must have a lot of patients.</b>

894
00:49:28,516 --> 00:49:30,602
<b>My wife's surname is also Yuk.</b>

895
00:49:30,685 --> 00:49:33,021
<b>Other than her, you're the only one
I know with that surname.</b>

896
00:49:33,104 --> 00:49:36,983
<b>Actually, there's my father-in-law,
brother-in-law, sister-in-law, and niece.</b>

897
00:49:37,067 --> 00:49:38,818
<b>Gosh, there are so many.</b>

898
00:49:39,444 --> 00:49:40,695
<b>You're going home today, right?</b>

899
00:49:40,779 --> 00:49:44,282
<b>Yes. Tomorrow is Children's Day,
so I'm happy I can be home for that.</b>

900
00:49:44,866 --> 00:49:45,825
<b>Yes, you're right.</b>

901
00:49:45,909 --> 00:49:47,327
<b>I can't go anywhere far.</b>

902
00:49:47,410 --> 00:49:50,163
<b>We're just going to eat
at a Chinese restaurant near our place.</b>

903
00:49:50,246 --> 00:49:51,748
<b>Won-jun loves <i>jajangmyeon.</i></b>

904
00:49:51,831 --> 00:49:54,584
<b>My kid loves <i>jajangmyeon</i> too. All kids do.</b>

905
00:49:55,126 --> 00:49:57,170
<b>You had a simple
laparoscopic cholecystectomy,</b>

906
00:49:57,253 --> 00:49:59,381
<b>so don't worry about
post-surgical complications.</b>

907
00:49:59,464 --> 00:50:01,091
<b>Don't overexert yourself</b>

908
00:50:01,174 --> 00:50:03,134
<b>but try to walk as much as you can.</b>

909
00:50:03,218 --> 00:50:05,011
<b>Exercise will help you, okay?</b>

910
00:50:05,512 --> 00:50:07,764
<b>All right. Here you go.</b>

911
00:50:07,847 --> 00:50:10,225
<b>Wow, who are you?</b>

912
00:50:10,308 --> 00:50:11,393
<b>Won-jun.</b>

913
00:50:11,476 --> 00:50:13,478
<b>You silly goose, what do you think?</b>

914
00:50:13,561 --> 00:50:16,022
<b>I'm the one who got rid of the ouchy
from your dad's tummy.</b>

915
00:50:16,606 --> 00:50:18,692
<b>Goodbye.
I'll see you at your next appointment.</b>

916
00:50:18,775 --> 00:50:20,568
<b>-Thank you.
-Thank you.</b>

917
00:50:20,652 --> 00:50:21,903
<b>Say goodbye properly.</b>

918
00:50:22,404 --> 00:50:24,280
<b>-Thank you, Dr. Lee!
-My pleasure!</b>

919
00:50:24,364 --> 00:50:26,783
<b>Oh, my. Look at this.</b>

920
00:50:26,866 --> 00:50:28,243
<b>-Hello.
-Hello.</b>

921
00:50:31,705 --> 00:50:32,664
<b>Hello.</b>

922
00:50:34,374 --> 00:50:35,667
<b>Did Song-hwa scold you again?</b>

923
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:37,419
<b>-Yes.
-No.</b>

924
00:50:37,919 --> 00:50:39,170
<b>I guess it was you then.</b>

925
00:50:39,254 --> 00:50:41,464
<b>It was Chi-hong this time.</b>

926
00:50:41,548 --> 00:50:42,674
<b>But he said no.</b>

927
00:50:43,216 --> 00:50:45,635
<b>He's a tough cookie
because he has a military background.</b>

928
00:50:46,261 --> 00:50:49,472
<b>It happened because
I couldn't answer her questions.</b>

929
00:50:49,597 --> 00:50:51,099
<b>Even I thought I sounded dumb.</b>

930
00:50:51,182 --> 00:50:53,810
<b>You graduated
from the Korea Military Academy, right?</b>

931
00:50:53,893 --> 00:50:56,479
<b>-Yes.
-I know someone from...</b>

932
00:50:56,563 --> 00:50:57,814
<b>Hello?</b>

933
00:50:58,398 --> 00:50:59,941
<b>Yes, where are you?</b>

934
00:51:00,358 --> 00:51:02,610
<b>Okay, I'll head over there now. All right.</b>

935
00:51:05,989 --> 00:51:06,990
<b>Yes, Professor.</b>

936
00:51:07,657 --> 00:51:08,658
<b>Right.</b>

937
00:51:09,325 --> 00:51:10,660
<b>Yes, I got it.</b>

938
00:51:11,536 --> 00:51:13,413
<b>You know the emergency patient
from the traffic accident yesterday?</b>

939
00:51:13,496 --> 00:51:14,789
<b>-Yes.
-We haven't operated</b>

940
00:51:14,873 --> 00:51:17,208
<b>because of unstable vitals
and severe bleeding.</b>

941
00:51:17,292 --> 00:51:18,501
<b>But it seems Professor Chae</b>

942
00:51:18,585 --> 00:51:20,670
<b>-will perform the surgery tonight.
-I see.</b>

943
00:51:20,754 --> 00:51:22,964
<b>-There will be a meeting later.
-Okay, great.</b>

944
00:51:23,256 --> 00:51:25,717
<b>-"Great"? Really?
-Yes.</b>

945
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:27,510
<b>She totally put you on the spot earlier.</b>

946
00:51:27,677 --> 00:51:30,096
<b>She was just asking questions.</b>

947
00:51:30,555 --> 00:51:32,307
<b>I wanted to work on that case anyway.</b>

948
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:35,810
<b>I was hoping to be assigned
in assisting Professor Chae for the case.</b>

949
00:51:35,935 --> 00:51:37,270
<b>This is perfect.</b>

950
00:51:37,604 --> 00:51:39,564
<b>-Dr. Ahn.
-Yes.</b>

951
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:41,900
<b>Why don't you get a cranial CT scan?</b>

952
00:51:43,777 --> 00:51:45,528
<b>Sure, if there's an employee discount.</b>

953
00:52:04,756 --> 00:52:06,508
<b>Sounds good. We'll do that.</b>

954
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:10,053
<b>You should take a nap</b>

955
00:52:10,136 --> 00:52:11,429
<b>and I'll see you guys tonight.</b>

956
00:52:11,513 --> 00:52:12,514
<b>Okay.</b>

957
00:52:15,642 --> 00:52:18,770
<b>She was going to do that
with the surgery anyway.</b>

958
00:52:18,853 --> 00:52:20,146
<b>You know that's not what matters.</b>

959
00:52:20,230 --> 00:52:22,273
<b>What matters to her
is whether we knew it or not.</b>

960
00:52:28,488 --> 00:52:29,447
<b>There are roses.</b>

961
00:52:30,156 --> 00:52:31,658
<b>Is it already the season for roses?</b>

962
00:52:33,076 --> 00:52:35,203
<b>Dr. Yong, you're very observant.</b>

963
00:52:35,286 --> 00:52:36,746
<b>My family has a flower shop.</b>

964
00:52:36,830 --> 00:52:38,706
<b>Everyone knows what roses look like.</b>

965
00:52:38,790 --> 00:52:39,958
<b>Not really. These days,</b>

966
00:52:40,041 --> 00:52:42,794
<b>many people don't know
the names of plants and flowers.</b>

967
00:52:49,008 --> 00:52:50,677
<b>Are they fake flowers?</b>

968
00:52:58,685 --> 00:53:01,062
<b>That's just wrong.</b>

969
00:53:05,024 --> 00:53:08,194
<b>I'm just realizing that it's been
a long time since I saw real flowers.</b>

970
00:53:08,862 --> 00:53:11,406
<b>Professor Chae,
are you going camping again this weekend?</b>

971
00:53:11,489 --> 00:53:12,532
<b>Yes, why do you ask?</b>

972
00:53:12,615 --> 00:53:13,992
<b>Can we join?</b>

973
00:53:14,117 --> 00:53:16,452
<b>You can come, right?
You're not working this weekend.</b>

974
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:18,496
<b>Can we join?</b>

975
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:21,583
<b>Yes, you can.
But do you guys really want to come?</b>

976
00:53:21,666 --> 00:53:22,750
<b>Yes.</b>

977
00:53:23,001 --> 00:53:25,461
<b>You keep us on our toes,</b>

978
00:53:26,045 --> 00:53:27,463
<b>but you don't make us uncomfortable.</b>

979
00:53:27,714 --> 00:53:30,592
<b>Gosh, Seok-min. My goodness.</b>

980
00:53:31,384 --> 00:53:32,635
<b>I just can't hate you.</b>

981
00:53:32,719 --> 00:53:34,137
<b>You annoy me here and there,</b>

982
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:35,722
<b>but you don't make me uncomfortable.</b>

983
00:53:37,432 --> 00:53:39,893
<b>Okay, let's do it.
There, you can see real roses</b>

984
00:53:39,976 --> 00:53:41,603
<b>as well as butterflies.</b>

985
00:53:41,686 --> 00:53:42,520
<b>I'm off.</b>

986
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:50,111
<b>Did you order?</b>

987
00:53:50,486 --> 00:53:51,821
<b>The coffee here is very good.</b>

988
00:53:52,322 --> 00:53:53,323
<b>Do you want some cake?</b>

989
00:53:54,532 --> 00:53:56,326
<b>Can we go somewhere quiet?</b>

990
00:53:57,493 --> 00:54:00,038
<b>-What?
-I have to talk to you about something.</b>

991
00:54:04,292 --> 00:54:06,461
<b>YULJE MEDICAL CENTER</b>

992
00:54:10,506 --> 00:54:11,591
<b>Ho-jun.</b>

993
00:54:12,133 --> 00:54:13,927
<b>Go get changed.</b>

994
00:54:14,010 --> 00:54:16,930
<b>I brought a T-shirt
and a pair of pants for you.</b>

995
00:54:17,013 --> 00:54:18,640
<b>The visiting hours will begin shortly.</b>

996
00:54:18,723 --> 00:54:20,391
<b>I'll get changed after I see Dad.</b>

997
00:54:20,475 --> 00:54:23,853
<b>Gosh, you still have 20 to 30 minutes.</b>

998
00:54:24,938 --> 00:54:27,774
<b>Hey, I see some chairs over there.
Let's go sit down.</b>

999
00:54:27,857 --> 00:54:29,067
<b>Okay.</b>

1000
00:54:30,276 --> 00:54:31,694
<b>She must be out of her mind.</b>

1001
00:54:33,529 --> 00:54:37,116
<b>I can't believe this.
Did she cancel her honeymoon?</b>

1002
00:54:37,325 --> 00:54:39,410
<b>Eun-bin! We're here.</b>

1003
00:54:44,248 --> 00:54:45,792
<b>Hey, don't be like that.</b>

1004
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,335
<b>Everything went well.</b>

1005
00:54:51,464 --> 00:54:53,257
<b>Jin-hui is a good photographer.</b>

1006
00:54:53,341 --> 00:54:55,009
<b>No, it's my camera.</b>

1007
00:54:55,093 --> 00:54:57,220
<b>Downloading all the photos
would be a nuisance,</b>

1008
00:54:57,303 --> 00:54:59,097
<b>so I told her to use my phone
to take photos.</b>

1009
00:54:59,722 --> 00:55:02,183
<b>Oh, your uncle was there too.</b>

1010
00:55:02,850 --> 00:55:05,395
<b>He said he wouldn't be able to make it.</b>

1011
00:55:05,478 --> 00:55:07,939
<b>Oh, who's this?</b>

1012
00:55:09,065 --> 00:55:11,859
<b>Isn't he the doctor
who performed your dad's surgery?</b>

1013
00:55:11,943 --> 00:55:13,820
<b>Eun-bin,
Dad's doctor came to your wedding?</b>

1014
00:55:13,903 --> 00:55:15,029
<b>Yes.</b>

1015
00:55:15,113 --> 00:55:15,947
<b>When?</b>

1016
00:55:16,698 --> 00:55:19,534
<b>He was the first one
to stop by the bride's room.</b>

1017
00:55:19,617 --> 00:55:21,786
<b>What's with that face though?</b>

1018
00:55:21,869 --> 00:55:24,497
<b>He didn't even take a picture.
He just ate and left.</b>

1019
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:25,915
<b>Come on. Be grateful that he came.</b>

1020
00:55:25,999 --> 00:55:28,334
<b>He asked me about the main course.
I told him it's <i>galbitang.</i></b>

1021
00:55:28,418 --> 00:55:31,379
<b>Then he got excited
and rushed to the diner.</b>

1022
00:55:31,462 --> 00:55:33,381
<b>He obviously came to my wedding
to have dinner.</b>

1023
00:55:33,464 --> 00:55:35,633
<b>Come on. <i>Galbitang</i> is nothing.</b>

1024
00:55:35,717 --> 00:55:38,761
<b>I'd love to take him out
for a steak dinner.</b>

1025
00:55:39,262 --> 00:55:41,389
<b>He'd say no to that anyway.</b>

1026
00:55:41,472 --> 00:55:43,099
<b>Doctors can't say yes to things like that.</b>

1027
00:55:43,182 --> 00:55:45,226
<b>I didn't think he'd be like this,</b>

1028
00:55:45,393 --> 00:55:46,894
<b>but he's actually very charming.</b>

1029
00:55:46,978 --> 00:55:49,772
<b>The ICU is open now. Come on in.</b>

1030
00:55:49,856 --> 00:55:51,899
<b>Oh, okay. Thank you.</b>

1031
00:55:51,983 --> 00:55:53,234
<b>Thank you.</b>

1032
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,239
<b>Hey, don't cry.</b>

1033
00:55:58,823 --> 00:56:00,533
<b>Are you going to cry in front of Dad?</b>

1034
00:56:03,286 --> 00:56:04,704
<b>Seriously, don't cry.</b>

1035
00:56:04,787 --> 00:56:06,956
<b>Why are you crying? His surgery went well.</b>

1036
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:09,125
<b>Dad will be so sad to see you cry.</b>

1037
00:56:11,794 --> 00:56:12,712
<b>Stop crying.</b>

1038
00:56:13,171 --> 00:56:15,590
<b>You will break Dad's heart.
You know that, right?</b>

1039
00:56:15,673 --> 00:56:16,883
<b>Right.</b>

1040
00:56:20,261 --> 00:56:21,095
<b>Smile.</b>

1041
00:56:25,475 --> 00:56:26,559
<b>Give me a bigger smile.</b>

1042
00:56:32,565 --> 00:56:33,566
<b>Aren't you leaving?</b>

1043
00:56:34,067 --> 00:56:36,903
<b>Hey. I have surgery tomorrow
as well as patient appointments,</b>

1044
00:56:36,986 --> 00:56:39,113
<b>-so I have a lot to do.
-Then reschedule the surgery.</b>

1045
00:56:39,197 --> 00:56:41,074
<b>I can't do that.</b>

1046
00:56:41,157 --> 00:56:42,617
<b>How many appointments?</b>

1047
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:43,701
<b>Twenty.</b>

1048
00:56:43,785 --> 00:56:45,328
<b>I have to go through their charts.</b>

1049
00:56:45,995 --> 00:56:47,246
<b>Why are you still here?</b>

1050
00:56:47,538 --> 00:56:49,123
<b>Everyone did a good job with the surgery,</b>

1051
00:56:49,207 --> 00:56:50,625
<b>so I want to stop by the office.</b>

1052
00:56:50,708 --> 00:56:53,461
<b>-Go check in on Ik-jun.
-Why?</b>

1053
00:56:53,544 --> 00:56:55,922
<b>I think something's up,
but he won't tell me.</b>

1054
00:56:56,005 --> 00:56:58,049
<b>-Really?
-I think it's a family matter,</b>

1055
00:56:58,132 --> 00:57:00,009
<b>so I didn't want to pry.</b>

1056
00:57:00,593 --> 00:57:02,470
<b>But that doesn't sound like him.</b>

1057
00:57:02,553 --> 00:57:05,056
<b>Well, I'm sure he'll sort it out.</b>

1058
00:57:05,139 --> 00:57:06,057
<b>Bye.</b>

1059
00:57:14,607 --> 00:57:16,275
<b><i>What did you just say?</i></b>

1060
00:57:16,943 --> 00:57:18,611
<b>I said I want a divorce.</b>

1061
00:57:20,446 --> 00:57:23,241
<b>I wouldn't call this a normal marriage.</b>

1062
00:57:23,741 --> 00:57:25,409
<b>Let's just go back to being friends.</b>

1063
00:57:27,745 --> 00:57:29,789
<b>We're like this because this was
what you wanted.</b>

1064
00:57:31,207 --> 00:57:33,000
<b>When you got transferred,</b>

1065
00:57:33,584 --> 00:57:36,087
<b>I told you I'd follow you to Germany</b>

1066
00:57:36,170 --> 00:57:37,004
<b>and you refused.</b>

1067
00:57:37,088 --> 00:57:38,589
<b>You wanted me to keep working.</b>

1068
00:57:38,673 --> 00:57:40,800
<b>Also, you wanted to raise U-ju in Korea.</b>

1069
00:57:40,883 --> 00:57:43,386
<b>That's why we're living like this.
So were we...</b>

1070
00:57:46,055 --> 00:57:47,431
<b>Were we separated?</b>

1071
00:57:47,515 --> 00:57:48,933
<b>No, we weren't.</b>

1072
00:57:50,184 --> 00:57:52,019
<b>I like that you have a career.</b>

1073
00:57:53,396 --> 00:57:56,149
<b>And I can totally look after U-ju
by myself.</b>

1074
00:57:56,732 --> 00:58:00,611
<b>I know that we've been living apart
for quite a while,</b>

1075
00:58:00,695 --> 00:58:02,697
<b>but we made that decision together.</b>

1076
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:03,990
<b>Why are you saying...</b>

1077
00:58:05,408 --> 00:58:06,367
<b>What's going on?</b>

1078
00:58:08,286 --> 00:58:09,871
<b>What's the real reason?</b>

1079
00:58:09,954 --> 00:58:12,039
<b>There's no such thing.</b>

1080
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:17,211
<b>I just felt that it was meaningless</b>

1081
00:58:17,336 --> 00:58:19,422
<b>to maintain this kind of marriage.</b>

1082
00:58:22,758 --> 00:58:23,968
<b>Do you mistrust me?</b>

1083
00:58:24,594 --> 00:58:25,428
<b>No.</b>

1084
00:58:27,096 --> 00:58:29,223
<b>I'm going to have lunch
with U-ju tomorrow,</b>

1085
00:58:29,307 --> 00:58:30,683
<b>just the two of us.</b>

1086
00:58:30,766 --> 00:58:32,226
<b>It's a special day, you know.</b>

1087
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:34,395
<b>You should work.</b>

1088
00:58:34,478 --> 00:58:36,314
<b>I'll stay with him tomorrow.</b>

1089
00:58:37,899 --> 00:58:41,068
<b>And about what I said...</b>

1090
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:45,364
<b>I hope you take it seriously.</b>

1091
00:59:08,763 --> 00:59:10,848
<b>Dr. Ahn, do you want to go for coffee?</b>

1092
00:59:11,724 --> 00:59:12,725
<b>Sure.</b>

1093
00:59:15,186 --> 00:59:17,813
<b>How many questions did I ask you today?</b>

1094
00:59:21,317 --> 00:59:22,360
<b>I'm not sure.</b>

1095
00:59:23,152 --> 00:59:25,238
<b>There were many. So many.</b>

1096
00:59:25,988 --> 00:59:26,822
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

1097
00:59:26,906 --> 00:59:28,449
<b>No, it's okay.</b>

1098
00:59:28,532 --> 00:59:32,453
<b>Chi-hong, do you know how many operations
I perform on a weekly basis?</b>

1099
00:59:34,288 --> 00:59:35,831
<b>Jeez, I'm asking you a question again.</b>

1100
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:38,334
<b>I have a problem, don't I?</b>

1101
00:59:38,542 --> 00:59:40,086
<b>I'm really sorry.</b>

1102
00:59:40,169 --> 00:59:42,713
<b>I think you do more than five a week,
on average.</b>

1103
00:59:43,297 --> 00:59:44,757
<b>That means, in a year...</b>

1104
00:59:45,424 --> 00:59:48,427
<b>I probably do about 250, roughly speaking.</b>

1105
00:59:48,761 --> 00:59:49,887
<b>Right.</b>

1106
00:59:50,596 --> 00:59:52,098
<b>I want you to be on your toes.</b>

1107

<b>When you're performing surgery

<b>Both you and Seok-min</b>

1110

<b>Yes.</b>

1111
01:00:07,530 --> 01:00:09,365
<b>You see, this job is hard.</b>

1112
01:00:09,448 --> 01:00:10,700
<b>But you get used to it quickly.</b>

1113
01:00:11,784 --> 01:00:16,747
<b>The thing is though, we should never get
too comfortable doing this.</b>

1114
01:00:17,123 --> 01:00:18,207
<b>That's why.</b>

1115
01:00:20,334 --> 01:00:21,168
<b>Right.</b>

1116
01:00:22,044 --> 01:00:24,922
<b>It's not because I don't like you,

1117
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:27,800
<b>And you'd better not give up
halfway through.</b>

1118
01:00:28,384 --> 01:00:29,468
<b>Okay.</b>

1119
01:00:29,552 --> 01:00:31,595
<b>Just trust me and follow my lead.</b>

-Yes, ma'am.</b>

-Professor, Chan-hyeong is doing great.</b>

01:00:54,035 --> 01:00:56,078
<b>Yes. Everything looks good,</b>

1125
01:00:56,162 --> 01:00:58,622

1126
01:00:58,706 --> 01:00:59,623
<b>All right.</b>

1127
01:01:08,090 --> 01:01:10,801
<b>Dr. Do walked you through
the surgery procedure, right?</b>

1128
01:01:10,885 --> 01:01:13,429
<b>Chan-hyeong's condition has improved,

1130
01:01:17,308 --> 01:01:21,270
<b>Doctor, please take good care

1131
01:01:22,396 --> 01:01:25,483
<b>My gosh, you've been staying
so strong until now.</b>

1132
01:01:25,566 --> 01:01:28,319
<b>Please save Chan-hyeong.</b>

1133
01:01:29,487 --> 01:01:33,366
<b>I wish it was me instead of him.</b>

1134
01:01:39,038 --> 01:01:40,790
<b>Don't cry.</b>

1135
01:01:41,749 --> 01:01:44,001
<b>You've been holding out so well.</b>

1136
01:01:45,419 --> 01:01:47,588
<b>I've been barely keeping it together.</b>

1137
01:01:50,883 --> 01:01:55,805
<b>Both my mom and my mother-in-law
think that we're still kids.</b>

1138

<b>Everyone says that we're immature.</b>

1139
01:02:00,309 --> 01:02:03,479
<b>So I've been acting all tough on purpose.</b>

1140
01:02:04,063 --> 01:02:06,232
<b>I wanted to cry, but I was afraid</b>

1141
01:02:06,690 --> 01:02:09,735
<b>that they'd say we're too young
to deal with this.</b>

1142

<b>They would tell me to go home

1143
01:02:12,113 --> 01:02:14,865
<b>What if they wouldn't even let me
see Chan-hyeong?</b>

1144
01:02:14,949 --> 01:02:18,202
<b>That's why I've been forcing myself
to act all tough.</b>

1145
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:22,873
<b>But I can't do it anymore.</b>

1146
01:02:24,083 --> 01:02:28,504
<b>Doctor, Chan-hyeong will be okay, right?</b>

1147
01:02:29,255 --> 01:02:30,881
<b>We've performed this surgery many times.</b>

1148

<b>We'll make sure he'll be okay.</b>

1149
01:02:33,259 --> 01:02:36,262
<b>Then, it will go well, right?</b>

1150
01:02:40,599 --> 01:02:43,269
<b>Yes, we'll do our best.</b>

<b>By the way, why did you go home

that it was a traffic accident victim.</b>

1196
01:06:10,392 --> 01:06:12,603
<b>They wanted us to let you know
as soon as possible</b>

1197
01:06:12,686 --> 01:06:14,647
<b>because he's your patient.</b>

1198
01:06:15,773 --> 01:06:17,900
<b>The organ is going to another patient
at our hospital,</b>

1199
01:06:17,983 --> 01:06:20,152
<b>so we'll have to take care
of the procurement as well.</b>

1200
01:06:21,904 --> 01:06:25,157
<b>Gosh, I feel bad.</b>

1201
01:06:29,828 --> 01:06:32,247
<b>His tricuspid valve is very small,
so it's hard to see.</b>

1202
01:06:32,998 --> 01:06:35,542
<b>No, not that way.
Pull it toward the patient's head.</b>

1203
01:06:36,043 --> 01:06:37,336
<b>Yes.</b>

1204
01:06:38,796 --> 01:06:41,423
<b>Pull harder,
or we'll have to make a bigger incision.</b>

1205
01:06:41,507 --> 01:06:43,008
<b>Okay, I'm sorry.</b>

1206
01:06:45,678 --> 01:06:47,471
<b>You see that monitor, right?</b>

1207
01:06:47,554 --> 01:06:50,474
<b>The line is flat now,
which means the heart rate is zero.</b>

1208
01:06:50,557 --> 01:06:51,475
<b>That means he's dead.</b>

1209
01:06:52,142 --> 01:06:53,227
<b>No.</b>

1210
01:06:53,310 --> 01:06:56,480
<b>It just means that Chan-hyeong's
current heart rate is zero.</b>

1211
01:06:56,563 --> 01:06:59,525
<b>His heart isn't beating at the moment.</b>

1212
01:06:59,608 --> 01:07:01,985
<b>They can't operate on him
while the heart is beating.</b>

1213
01:07:02,069 --> 01:07:04,405
<b>That's why the cardioplegia solution
is administered</b>

1214
01:07:04,488 --> 01:07:06,699
<b>every 30 minutes to induce cardiac stasis
when performing</b>

1215
01:07:06,782 --> 01:07:08,033
<b>any cardiac surgery procedures.</b>

1216
01:07:08,117 --> 01:07:10,452
<b>And during cardiac stasis,
that machine over there</b>

1217
01:07:10,536 --> 01:07:12,996
<b>acts as the patient's heart and lungs.</b>

1218
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:15,124
<b>It supplies blood throughout the body</b>

1219
01:07:15,207 --> 01:07:17,626
<b>while doctors are operating on the heart.</b>

1220
01:07:17,710 --> 01:07:19,294
<b>All right. Let's go over it again.</b>

1221
01:07:19,878 --> 01:07:23,173
<b>Stop Chan-hyeong's heart,
which is replaced by the machine.</b>

1222
01:07:23,257 --> 01:07:26,051
<b>While the machine's working,
the doctors quickly fix the heart.</b>

1223
01:07:26,135 --> 01:07:27,177
<b>When everything's fixed,</b>

1224
01:07:27,261 --> 01:07:30,097
<b>they get rid of the tubes
that hook him up to the machine.</b>

1225
01:07:30,180 --> 01:07:32,683
<b>You're telling me all this
so that you can remember the steps.</b>

1226
01:07:32,766 --> 01:07:34,518
<b>You're doing it to memorize the steps.</b>

1227
01:07:34,601 --> 01:07:35,561
<b>That's right.</b>

1228
01:07:36,061 --> 01:07:38,313
<b>-You understand the procedure, right?
-Yes, totally.</b>

<b>Oh, they've finished

1232
01:07:56,165 --> 01:07:58,333
<b>The committee will meet soon

1233

<b>He's a TA victim, but I heard
the organs are in good condition.</b>

1234

<b>They're probably negotiating
the time frame with the other hospital.</b>

1235
01:08:06,258 --> 01:08:07,426
<b>Why? Do you know that patient?</b>

1236
01:08:07,509 --> 01:08:08,886
<b>He was my patient.</b>

1237

<b>He was totally fine

1238

<b>Really? My goodness.</b>

1239
01:08:14,516 --> 01:08:16,977
<b>It must've been a very difficult decision.</b>

1240
01:08:18,061 --> 01:08:19,980
<b>You should say a proper goodbye.</b>

1241
