1
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:15,755
<b>I guess Won doesn't know...</b>

2
00:00:17,801 --> 00:00:20,425
<b>that you like him.</b>

3
00:00:21,872 --> 00:00:24,035
<b>You said you liked seeing him.</b>

4
00:00:26,843 --> 00:00:28,905
<b>To be more precise, it's unrequited love.</b>

5
00:00:32,249 --> 00:00:34,275
<b>Do you not feel that way anymore?</b>

6
00:00:35,052 --> 00:00:36,675
<b>Well...</b>

7
00:00:49,266 --> 00:00:50,925
<b>I like him.</b>

8
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:56,195
<b>I really like looking at him.</b>

9
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,500
<b>The way he cherishes you,</b>

10
00:00:59,509 --> 00:01:01,705
<b>the way he misses you,</b>

11
00:01:02,612 --> 00:01:06,205
<b>the way a person gives his all for another person...</b>

12
00:01:07,017 --> 00:01:08,905
<b>I like it all.</b>

13
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:12,915
<b>Won doesn't know how you feel, does he?</b>

14
00:01:13,523 --> 00:01:15,215
<b>No.</b>

15
00:01:15,425 --> 00:01:18,015
<b>I don't want him to know.</b>

16
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:24,395
<b>You had no idea how much he cherished you either.</b>

17
00:01:29,272 --> 00:01:31,095
<b>I hope...</b>

18
00:01:31,475 --> 00:01:33,965
<b>he won't know either.</b>

19
00:01:47,057 --> 00:01:51,115
<b>(A Piece of Your Mind)</b>

20
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:56,900
<b>Why are you following me?</b>

21
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,895
<b>It's late. I'll take you home.</b>

22
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,340
<b>- I... - Don't.</b>

23
00:02:08,345 --> 00:02:10,310
<b>- What? - Don't do anything.</b>

24
00:02:10,313 --> 00:02:11,310
<b>I didn't do anything.</b>

25
00:02:11,314 --> 00:02:14,880
<b>Look. I'm okay, so don't worry about what Ji Soo said...</b>

26
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:16,680
<b>- I'll pretend I don't know. - No.</b>

27
00:02:16,686 --> 00:02:19,215
<b>Don't do that either. Don't do anything.</b>

28
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:24,615
<b>What did you mean by you like looking at me?</b>

29
00:02:26,096 --> 00:02:28,090
<b>- I'm leaving. - I'll go with you.</b>

30
00:02:28,098 --> 00:02:29,960
<b>I won't do anything.</b>

31
00:02:29,966 --> 00:02:32,095
<b>Can I really do nothing?</b>

32
00:02:35,772 --> 00:02:37,695
<b>Isn't there anything I can do for you?</b>

33
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:39,940
<b>If I say there is, will you do it?</b>

34
00:02:39,943 --> 00:02:41,605
<b>Tell me.</b>

35
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:44,805
<b>It'll be tough.</b>

36
00:02:45,615 --> 00:02:47,345
<b>Try me.</b>

37
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:51,445
<b>You must be in a good mood.</b>

38
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:55,690
<b>You were at Ji Soo's point of reaction.</b>

39
00:02:55,692 --> 00:02:57,620
<b>That's why you're in a good mood.</b>

40
00:02:57,627 --> 00:03:00,955
<b>You're right. Goodnight.</b>

41
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,565
<b>Darn it. I'm so embarrassed.</b>

42
00:03:23,253 --> 00:03:24,975
<b>Ji Soo.</b>

43
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,585
<b>Is this not a good place?</b>

44
00:03:34,531 --> 00:03:36,130
<b>Should we go to the studio?</b>

45
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:38,695
<b>You seem to be comfortable there.</b>

46
00:04:00,357 --> 00:04:02,915
<b>We're at the studio now.</b>

47
00:04:05,262 --> 00:04:07,625
<b>So you can hear too.</b>

48
00:04:12,302 --> 00:04:14,165
<b>Is it too dark?</b>

49
00:04:34,624 --> 00:04:36,845
<b>Why are you comfortable here?</b>

50
00:04:37,627 --> 00:04:39,685
<b>You said you were more comfortable at the studio.</b>

51
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:48,795
<b>Ji Soo.</b>

52
00:04:54,411 --> 00:04:58,035
<b>Let's take it slowly. Slowly.</b>

53
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:04,475
<b>I heard you recited it like an incantation...</b>

54
00:05:05,355 --> 00:05:07,950
<b>whenever you were scared walking home alone...</b>

55
00:05:07,957 --> 00:05:10,115
<b>after I left Norway.</b>

56
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,155
<b>I can do it alone, Won.</b>

57
00:05:16,966 --> 00:05:20,765
<b>Get used to it slowly. Slowly.</b>

58
00:05:35,352 --> 00:05:36,945
<b>Sure.</b>

59
00:05:39,122 --> 00:05:41,015
<b>Let's take it slowly.</b>

60
00:06:01,511 --> 00:06:03,565
<b>Did you talk to her?</b>

61
00:06:23,767 --> 00:06:27,095
<b>No. She won't talk to me.</b>

62
00:06:29,873 --> 00:06:32,695
<b>I'll continue to know nothing.</b>

63
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:09,410
<b>Our studio may end up only renting out our mics.</b>

64
00:07:09,412 --> 00:07:13,710
<b>How nice would it have been to film that in our studio?</b>

65
00:07:13,716 --> 00:07:15,710
<b>The hourly rate was insane.</b>

66
00:07:15,718 --> 00:07:17,780
<b>Jin Moo brings you a lot of work.</b>

67
00:07:17,787 --> 00:07:18,880
<b>What's the use?</b>

68
00:07:18,888 --> 00:07:21,050
<b>They always bring a sound engineer.</b>

69
00:07:21,057 --> 00:07:23,545
<b>Your talents are being wasted.</b>

70
00:07:24,494 --> 00:07:26,890
<b>I guess it's hard to make it in this field too.</b>

71
00:07:26,896 --> 00:07:28,830
<b>It's hard everywhere.</b>

72
00:07:28,832 --> 00:07:32,200
<b>What if you don't get to debut until you're 60?</b>

73
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:34,200
<b>I'm fine with what I do now.</b>

74
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:36,070
<b>I'm happy just being kept on.</b>

75
00:07:36,072 --> 00:07:37,795
<b>Liar.</b>

76
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:46,775
<b>Still, I'm sure you'll debut before you turn 60.</b>

77
00:07:47,984 --> 00:07:50,245
<b>Gosh.</b>

78
00:07:51,521 --> 00:07:54,120
<b>Hey. Leave that and go.</b>

79
00:07:54,123 --> 00:07:55,620
<b>I'll put them away first.</b>

80
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:58,320
<b>I'll do it. I forgot I was expecting a guest.</b>

81
00:07:58,328 --> 00:08:00,385
<b>Okay.</b>

82
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,800
<b>Okay. I'll take that.</b>

83
00:08:06,803 --> 00:08:08,665
<b>Thanks for today.</b>

84
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:13,765
<b>It's okay.</b>

85
00:08:17,013 --> 00:08:18,605
<b>Gosh.</b>

86
00:08:21,718 --> 00:08:24,020
<b>Hey. Open the door for me.</b>

87
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,545
<b>Okay.</b>

88
00:08:29,359 --> 00:08:31,115
<b>Gosh.</b>

89
00:08:44,574 --> 00:08:46,200
<b>You're so mean.</b>

90
00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:47,710
<b>How could you just say that?</b>

91
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:49,170
<b>Crushes are always in secret.</b>

92
00:08:49,178 --> 00:08:51,210
<b>No one tells the person they have a crush on them.</b>

93
00:08:51,214 --> 00:08:52,610
<b>What do you mean?</b>

94
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:55,210
<b>You said everything in front of Ha Won.</b>

95
00:08:55,218 --> 00:08:57,620
<b>Were you with Won?</b>

96
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,715
<b>You said you were home.</b>

97
00:09:00,523 --> 00:09:03,945
<b>What were you doing together at home at night?</b>

98
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,620
<b>That girl is Han Seo Woo.</b>

99
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:09,030
<b>Leave a little later so you don't run into her.</b>

100
00:09:09,032 --> 00:09:10,700
<b>No good will come of meeting each other.</b>

101
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,560
<b>- Avoid her. - That's a bit much.</b>

102
00:09:12,569 --> 00:09:14,800
<b>Han Seo Woo knows too much about Kim Ji Soo...</b>

103
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,970
<b>whom you're so curious about.</b>

104
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:20,965
<b>And she's most curious about you right now.</b>

105
00:09:21,344 --> 00:09:22,940
<b>The two of your frantic curiosity...</b>

106
00:09:22,946 --> 00:09:24,610
<b>will only lead to Kim Ji Soo.</b>

107
00:09:24,614 --> 00:09:26,640
<b>What's the use in talking? It's best not to know anything.</b>

108
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,750
<b>Don't even bring up her name.</b>

109
00:09:28,751 --> 00:09:32,175
<b>Ji Soo this. Ji Soo that. You talk about her the most.</b>

110
00:09:32,188 --> 00:09:33,180
<b>Me?</b>

111
00:09:33,189 --> 00:09:37,145
<b>The address here is 47-431 Wokin-dong.</b>

112
00:09:39,128 --> 00:09:41,530
<b>This house is like Ha Won's office.</b>

113
00:09:41,531 --> 00:09:43,755
<b>He discusses important issues here.</b>

114
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,625
<b>It's the address for the package.</b>

115
00:09:46,069 --> 00:09:48,870
<b>That's why he wanted to receive it here.</b>

116
00:09:48,871 --> 00:09:51,865
<b>- I guess. - I see.</b>

117
00:09:52,742 --> 00:09:54,310
<b>I know I sold the dishes,</b>

118
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:56,135
<b>but why did I do that?</b>

119
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:59,075
<b>She doesn't know why?</b>

120
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:02,275
<b>(Prescription)</b>

121
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,485
<b>If you keep talking to it, it'll find her on its own.</b>

122
00:10:08,491 --> 00:10:12,890
<b>Wouldn't it be nice to record songs with the windows open here?</b>

123
00:10:12,895 --> 00:10:14,490
<b>I really liked the performances...</b>

124
00:10:14,497 --> 00:10:17,300
<b>recorded in places like houses and churches too.</b>

125
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,155
<b>The acoustics are nice here.</b>

126
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:22,530
<b>When you go to a nice church, you can hear the piano more clearly.</b>

127
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:24,270
<b>It's like that here.</b>

128
00:10:24,273 --> 00:10:26,970
<b>I should try recording something here.</b>

129
00:10:26,976 --> 00:10:29,210
<b>If you do, let me hear it.</b>

130
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:30,310
<b>Of course.</b>

131
00:10:30,313 --> 00:10:33,210
<b>Use your work as an excuse to be here with Won.</b>

132
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:35,275
<b>Oh, come on.</b>

133
00:10:36,319 --> 00:10:38,245
<b>There are no curtains here, are there?</b>

134
00:10:38,588 --> 00:10:41,985
<b>- No. - How far does the sunlight reach?</b>

135
00:10:44,694 --> 00:10:47,030
<b>Enough to cover the entire living room.</b>

136
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:50,055
<b>Sunlight is precious in Oslo. The afternoons are short.</b>

137
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,930
<b>I saw pictures of Korea, and there were curtains in every room.</b>

138
00:10:53,936 --> 00:10:56,100
<b>Won and I used to wonder...</b>

139
00:10:56,105 --> 00:10:58,700
<b>why they blocked out the precious sunlight.</b>

140
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:00,865
<b>Sunlight is precious to me too.</b>

141
00:11:01,177 --> 00:11:03,935
<b>- I live in a semi-basement. - I see.</b>

142
00:11:04,213 --> 00:11:06,235
<b>Have you ever visited Ha Won's house?</b>

143
00:11:06,516 --> 00:11:08,180
<b>Of course, not.</b>

144
00:11:08,184 --> 00:11:10,775
<b>I wonder what his place looks like.</b>

145
00:11:11,187 --> 00:11:14,415
<b>- Should I check it out for you? - That's such a transparent excuse.</b>

146
00:11:15,391 --> 00:11:17,285
<b>Just show me around this place.</b>

147
00:11:25,668 --> 00:11:27,595
<b>He won't invite me over anyway.</b>

148
00:11:28,671 --> 00:11:32,100
<b>Here comes the evidence that this place is his office.</b>

149
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:35,365
<b>It's business for Ha Won, but you have ulterior motives.</b>

150
00:11:42,485 --> 00:11:44,915
<b>- I've gotten comfortable. - What?</b>

151
00:11:45,888 --> 00:11:49,785
<b>I've become quite comfortable talking with you, Ji Soo.</b>

152
00:11:50,893 --> 00:11:53,885
<b>Let's look for furniture that would be nice here.</b>

153
00:11:54,197 --> 00:11:56,130
<b>Just the bare minimum.</b>

154
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,555
<b>Won doesn't keep anything around that he doesn't need.</b>

155
00:11:58,868 --> 00:12:00,525
<b>Do that for me.</b>

156
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:08,265
<b>Will you do me a favor in return?</b>

157
00:12:08,377 --> 00:12:09,935
<b>What is it?</b>

158
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,630
<b>There's something strange.</b>

159
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,395
<b>Ji Soo doesn't know why she sold her dishes.</b>

160
00:12:40,877 --> 00:12:42,635
<b>Why did she?</b>

161
00:12:45,615 --> 00:12:47,175
<b>I don't know.</b>

162
00:12:54,957 --> 00:12:56,645
<b>Do you live here?</b>

163
00:13:02,732 --> 00:13:04,625
<b>I sent you an e-mail.</b>

164
00:13:05,301 --> 00:13:08,495
<b>That place is too empty. Make sure you buy them.</b>

165
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:18,735
<b>- These are Ji Soo's style. - She picked them with me.</b>

166
00:13:19,615 --> 00:13:20,710
<b>Make sure to buy them.</b>

167
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:23,375
<b>She'll only do what I ask if you do.</b>

168
00:13:24,287 --> 00:13:26,780
<b>She worries about you all the time.</b>

169
00:13:26,789 --> 00:13:28,845
<b>There's nothing to worry about me.</b>

170
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,655
<b>I'm worried about Han Seo Woo who lives here.</b>

171
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:36,125
<b>The doors are about to break down.</b>

172
00:13:36,999 --> 00:13:39,855
<b>It looks like it would be cold and damp.</b>

173
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:48,035
<b>You're staring at me way too obviously.</b>

174
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,765
<b>I'm so offended.</b>

175
00:13:51,514 --> 00:13:54,675
<b>I did something important, but I won't tell you.</b>

176
00:13:55,184 --> 00:13:57,920
<b>- What is it? - What do I get in return?</b>

177
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,950
<b>You say that all the time.</b>

178
00:13:59,956 --> 00:14:02,185
<b>Just tell me. I don't care how difficult it is.</b>

179
00:14:04,193 --> 00:14:07,215
<b>I'll tell you, so you have to do it no matter what.</b>

180
00:14:08,464 --> 00:14:13,155
<b>I wake up every night at 2am and 4am.</b>

181
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:17,525
<b>I'll call you whenever I do.</b>

182
00:14:22,478 --> 00:14:24,935
<b>It's very difficult, isn't it?</b>

183
00:14:25,748 --> 00:14:27,675
<b>I'm always awake at those times.</b>

184
00:14:28,084 --> 00:14:30,405
<b>- Call me. - Really?</b>

185
00:14:35,091 --> 00:14:38,055
<b>Ji Soo agreed to talk to you.</b>

186
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:42,455
<b>Tomorrow evening.</b>

187
00:14:45,167 --> 00:14:47,095
<b>Are you touched?</b>

188
00:14:47,336 --> 00:14:49,125
<b>I did good, didn't I?</b>

189
00:14:59,949 --> 00:15:03,305
<b>- What are you doing? - I'm looking at you with pity.</b>

190
00:15:06,589 --> 00:15:08,745
<b>I'm watching him with pity.</b>

191
00:15:20,536 --> 00:15:22,025
<b>Seo Woo.</b>

192
00:15:26,542 --> 00:15:28,065
<b>Thank you.</b>

193
00:16:24,667 --> 00:16:27,995
<b>(2:04am)</b>

194
00:16:32,274 --> 00:16:38,135
<b>(Before Dawn)</b>

195
00:16:42,785 --> 00:16:47,745
<b>(Han Seo Woo)</b>

196
00:17:35,271 --> 00:17:37,025
<b>Room service.</b>

197
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:44,365
<b>- Shall I extend your stay? - No.</b>

198
00:17:44,613 --> 00:17:45,980
<b>Aren't you going to work again?</b>

199
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:48,750
<b>I'm going to enjoy touring around our hotels for the rest of my life,</b>

200
00:17:48,751 --> 00:17:51,745
<b>using all the hotel vouchers that I got as an employee.</b>

201
00:17:52,088 --> 00:17:54,175
<b>You've never used any.</b>

202
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,585
<b>You must have quite a lot of them.</b>

203
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,755
<b>I'll let you rest.</b>

204
00:18:26,722 --> 00:18:28,090
<b>Where is Seo Woo?</b>

205
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:30,045
<b>She had breakfast and left.</b>

206
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:36,425
<b>What are you wearing?</b>

207
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:40,555
<b>What's wrong with it?</b>

208
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:43,725
<b>It's just us two in the house.</b>

209
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:48,405
<b>Let's not get too comfortable around each other.</b>

210
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:56,705
<b>I said not to waste the soup!</b>

211
00:19:06,629 --> 00:19:08,985
<b>I wear this all the time.</b>

212
00:19:09,798 --> 00:19:11,700
<b>Hand me the list quickly.</b>

213
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,470
<b>Let's hurry things.</b>

214
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:16,565
<b>Min Jung?</b>

215
00:19:16,672 --> 00:19:19,300
<b>Are you here early to see me?</b>

216
00:19:19,308 --> 00:19:20,840
<b>Shall we go to my office together?</b>

217
00:19:20,843 --> 00:19:22,905
<b>No, I'll finish this first.</b>

218
00:19:24,213 --> 00:19:27,375
<b>Are you going on a trip or something?</b>

219
00:19:28,184 --> 00:19:31,050
<b>Doctor, my appointment is at 1:30pm.</b>

220
00:19:31,053 --> 00:19:33,815
<b>- Right. - It's 1:15pm right now.</b>

221
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:36,085
<b>I'll see you at my appointment.</b>

222
00:19:36,692 --> 00:19:38,260
<b>Gosh.</b>

223
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,730
<b>It's been forever since I took a trip.</b>

224
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:45,595
<b>Why are we living like this, eating gimbap and sandwiches?</b>

225
00:19:45,801 --> 00:19:47,595
<b>Doctor.</b>

226
00:19:48,003 --> 00:19:49,865
<b>Oh, okay.</b>

227
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:54,595
<b>Right, why don't you do a test?</b>

228
00:19:56,512 --> 00:19:59,280
<b>It hasn't been commercialized yet,</b>

229
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,850
<b>but it's about having a conversation with a device...</b>

230
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:05,220
<b>that portrays your personality and emotions.</b>

231
00:20:05,221 --> 00:20:06,980
<b>Are you interested?</b>

232
00:20:06,989 --> 00:20:08,390
<b>I'll see you at 1:30pm.</b>

233
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:10,685
<b>Okay, okay.</b>

234
00:20:10,693 --> 00:20:12,755
<b>My gosh.</b>

235
00:20:13,262 --> 00:20:16,290
<b>I bought this a little while ago, so it's still warm.</b>

236
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:19,155
<b>Eat this too. I'll see you at my office.</b>

237
00:20:19,602 --> 00:20:21,400
<b>Gosh, my back.</b>

238
00:20:21,403 --> 00:20:26,035
<b>My back hurts because I'm always stuck in my office.</b>

239
00:20:26,709 --> 00:20:29,310
<b>It's good for menopause...</b>

240
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:32,475
<b>to move every part of your body like this.</b>

241
00:20:32,548 --> 00:20:35,845
<b>I'll see you in 10 minutes then.</b>

242
00:20:42,691 --> 00:20:45,255
<b>It's just tuna. I don't want it.</b>

243
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,735
<b>Do you have a place to stay?</b>

244
00:21:01,443 --> 00:21:04,205
<b>Did you come all the way here to ask me that?</b>

245
00:21:13,622 --> 00:21:16,550
<b>You keep screening my calls.</b>

246
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:18,720
<b>Just enjoy your relationship.</b>

247
00:21:18,727 --> 00:21:20,615
<b>And don't mind me.</b>

248
00:21:21,163 --> 00:21:23,825
<b>You're so chill.</b>

249
00:21:24,433 --> 00:21:26,295
<b>I'll get going.</b>

250
00:21:28,737 --> 00:21:31,465
<b>Goodness. Seriously.</b>

251
00:21:35,411 --> 00:21:37,705
<b>Why do you look so down?</b>

252
00:21:40,449 --> 00:21:42,610
<b>I'm getting all achy...</b>

253
00:21:42,618 --> 00:21:43,810
<b>now that I have less work.</b>

254
00:21:43,819 --> 00:21:47,080
<b>Why do you have less work? Chang Sup eats the most.</b>

255
00:21:47,089 --> 00:21:49,290
<b>You guys ate a lot too.</b>

256
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:53,255
<b>I was so good to you, and you ate so much.</b>

257
00:21:53,629 --> 00:21:57,885
<b>Now that's more like you, raising your voice like that.</b>

258
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:02,625
<b>So...</b>

259
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:05,040
<b>stop acting out, and come back.</b>

260
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:08,340
<b>I have a few gift certificates left at the salon.</b>

261
00:22:08,344 --> 00:22:10,070
<b>You can use them.</b>

262
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:11,675
<b>It's a gift for you.</b>

263
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:30,430
<b>What time are you going to talk today?</b>

264
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:33,260
<b>I'll be in charge of the hardware and sensor signals.</b>

265
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:35,470
<b>And Do Hyun will be in charge of the processor and output.</b>

266
00:22:35,471 --> 00:22:38,040
<b>I'll do the software training.</b>

267
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,740
<b>How much test data do we have so far?</b>

268
00:22:40,743 --> 00:22:42,905
<b>She won't answer me.</b>

269
00:22:43,312 --> 00:22:45,475
<b>I'll help you.</b>

270
00:22:47,483 --> 00:22:48,650
<b>- Where are you going? - We're taking a break.</b>

271
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:50,345
<b>I need to step out.</b>

272
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,805
<b>Ji Soo.</b>

273
00:23:19,248 --> 00:23:21,575
<b>Exactly what time today?</b>

274
00:23:26,789 --> 00:23:28,585
<b>Okay.</b>

275
00:23:30,192 --> 00:23:33,355
<b>It's 6pm today. Good luck.</b>

276
00:23:36,932 --> 00:23:38,695
<b>Did she leave?</b>

277
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:44,440
<b>At 6pm tonight.</b>

278
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,335
<b>Finally.</b>

279
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:22,665
<b>- Good work. - Good work.</b>

280
00:24:23,412 --> 00:24:25,280
<b>Finally what, at 6pm?</b>

281
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,780
<b>Is it near the studio?</b>

282
00:24:26,782 --> 00:24:29,150
<b>Hand out our business cards if you can.</b>

283
00:24:29,151 --> 00:24:30,710
<b>Let's work hard at promoting our studio.</b>

284
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:34,015
<b>Oh, no. We didn't choose a location.</b>

285
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:37,285
<b>Sit down, guys.</b>

286
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:41,530
<b>Oh, hello.</b>

287
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:44,185
<b>In Wook is here. Let's join them.</b>

288
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:51,525
<b>We offer discounts for practices.</b>

289
00:24:56,678 --> 00:24:59,675
<b>- Why aren't you giving me one? - Of course, I will.</b>

290
00:24:59,848 --> 00:25:01,535
<b>Here.</b>

291
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:05,415
<b>I heard your wife was traveling. Is she not back yet?</b>

292
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:11,445
<b>No. She doesn't seem to want to come back.</b>

293
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:17,690
<b>What is a woman thinking when she takes a trip alone?</b>

294
00:25:17,699 --> 00:25:19,755
<b>What about a man?</b>

295
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:22,170
<b>This is not about a difference between men and women.</b>

296
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:24,540
<b>They could go on a trip alone if they have a reason.</b>

297
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:27,300
<b>They might need some time to think,</b>

298
00:25:27,309 --> 00:25:28,410
<b>or maybe to meet someone.</b>

299
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:30,405
<b>Meet whom?</b>

300
00:25:31,013 --> 00:25:32,875
<b>Soon Ho, please stop.</b>

301
00:25:33,248 --> 00:25:37,105
<b>He's already sensitive because of the recording.</b>

302
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,620
<b>I hear you're taking In Wook out. How could you do that?</b>

303
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:43,590
<b>Who said that? No one told me.</b>

304
00:25:43,592 --> 00:25:45,815
<b>No, it's been called off.</b>

305
00:25:54,169 --> 00:25:56,070
<b>Try to reschedule the recording.</b>

306
00:25:56,071 --> 00:25:58,835
<b>His slump won't last long.</b>

307
00:25:59,841 --> 00:26:01,495
<b>Excuse me.</b>

308
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:04,405
<b>You left behind something important.</b>

309
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:12,520
<b>Did I do something wrong?</b>

310
00:26:12,521 --> 00:26:14,690
<b>You're being rude to my face.</b>

311
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:19,160
<b>Just tell me what exactly made you mad.</b>

312
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:22,230
<b>Is it because I said she may be meeting someone?</b>

313
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:25,000
<b>Why are you getting strange ideas? I meant a friend.</b>

<b>A female friend.</b>

315
00:26:26,602 --> 00:26:29,525
<b>She could've gone there to meet...</b>

316
00:26:32,107 --> 00:26:33,835
<b>Your wife...</b>

317
00:26:35,377 --> 00:26:37,365
<b>is cool.</b>

318
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:47,375
<b>What did I say?</b>

319
00:27:11,113 --> 00:27:12,975
<b>Do you see me?</b>

320
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:17,145
<b>I don't.</b>

321
00:27:20,422 --> 00:27:23,085
<b>Oh, I see you. Here.</b>

322
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:25,185
<b>I see you.</b>

323
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,705
<b>That way.</b>

324
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:20,775
<b>Ji Soo. We didn't set a location.</b>

325
00:28:21,683 --> 00:28:23,545
<b>Near the studio.</b>

326
00:28:26,388 --> 00:28:27,915
<b>The overpass?</b>

327
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,715
<b>I know where.</b>

328
00:28:35,931 --> 00:28:38,125
<b>You'll talk to him only once?</b>

329
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:41,095
<b>That's so mean.</b>

330
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:48,235
<b>Okay. Just once.</b>

331
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:50,805
<b>Okay.</b>

332
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:54,735
<b>You have to talk to Ha Won...</b>

333
00:28:55,951 --> 00:28:57,945
<b>later, okay?</b>

334
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:00,915
<b>Even if it's just once.</b>

335
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:10,185
<b>I'll let you rest now.</b>

336
00:29:17,873 --> 00:29:21,135
<b>You heard, right? She'll talk to you only once.</b>

337
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:28,945
<b>What will you talk about if it's only once?</b>

338
00:29:30,552 --> 00:29:32,145
<b>That must be hard.</b>

339
00:29:32,921 --> 00:29:35,215
<b>There's something I want to hear,</b>

340
00:29:36,558 --> 00:29:38,485
<b>and something I want to tell her.</b>

341
00:29:42,731 --> 00:29:44,385
<b>See you.</b>

342
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:21,495
<b>(5:59pm)</b>

343
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:54,155
<b>Ji Soo.</b>

344
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,135
<b>Ji Soo.</b>

345
00:31:43,251 --> 00:31:44,745
<b>Ji Soo.</b>

346
00:31:47,923 --> 00:31:49,415
<b>Ji Soo.</b>

347
00:31:57,299 --> 00:31:58,995
<b>Ji Soo.</b>

348
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:02,870
<b>I became miserable, but I didn't call him.</b>

349
00:32:02,871 --> 00:32:05,165
<b>I won't. I will never.</b>

350
00:32:07,208 --> 00:32:09,005
<b>I know, but...</b>

351
00:32:10,078 --> 00:32:11,765
<b>I understand, but...</b>

352
00:32:14,482 --> 00:32:16,445
<b>please come out.</b>

353
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,955
<b>Ji Soo.</b>

354
00:32:30,832 --> 00:32:32,295
<b>Ji Soo.</b>

355
00:32:34,402 --> 00:32:37,765
<b>"Ji Soo."</b>

356
00:32:38,073 --> 00:32:40,035
<b>Are you going to say my name all day long?</b>

357
00:32:56,257 --> 00:32:57,785
<b>What's wrong?</b>

358
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,715
<b>Why aren't you talking?</b>

359
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:03,625
<b>Well...</b>

360
00:33:17,379 --> 00:33:20,275
<b>It's just this once. I'll talk to you once.</b>

361
00:33:21,483 --> 00:33:23,305
<b>What do you want to talk about?</b>

362
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:31,945
<b>I thought a lot about what I should talk about, but...</b>

363
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:37,325
<b>I wondered...</b>

364
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,600
<b>what we'd talk about...</b>

365
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:44,925
<b>if we had just one chance to talk.</b>

366
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:49,705
<b>- Did you do that on purpose? - Yes.</b>

367
00:33:50,478 --> 00:33:54,675
<b>"What would Ha Won say to me if he had only one chance?"</b>

368
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:58,705
<b>But look at you. You can't say anything.</b>

369
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:04,185
<b>"Ji Soo, Ji Soo."</b>

370
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,755
<b>You kept saying my name, so I was listening.</b>

371
00:34:09,731 --> 00:34:13,155
<b>Do you see the church with the blue roof?</b>

372
00:34:15,937 --> 00:34:19,135
<b>- Yes. - Three trees above the building.</b>

373
00:34:19,441 --> 00:34:21,635
<b>Autumn Study Dorm.</b>

374
00:34:28,083 --> 00:34:30,050
<b>What about the high school on the left?</b>

375
00:34:30,051 --> 00:34:31,545
<b>I don't remember.</b>

376
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:34,715
<b>Where's Seo Woo?</b>

377
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:37,085
<b>Find her for me.</b>

378
00:34:44,732 --> 00:34:46,355
<b>And?</b>

379
00:34:46,568 --> 00:34:48,900
<b>- Find her first. - Why?</b>

380
00:34:48,903 --> 00:34:51,965
<b>Why else? It's all for her.</b>

381
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:56,105
<b>She says she's happy just looking at you. How does that make you feel?</b>

382
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:02,175
<b>- I'm not sure. - Since when is Ha Won "not sure"?</b>

383
00:35:03,218 --> 00:35:05,745
<b>It felt weird for me.</b>

384
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:08,490
<b>But then again,</b>

385
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:12,245
<b>Seo Woo and you seem to suit each other for some reason.</b>

386
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,655
<b>There's someone who suits Ji Soo.</b>

387
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:45,855
<b>Are you done? Already?</b>

388
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,195
<b>Ji Soo told me to do this.</b>

389
00:35:54,602 --> 00:35:57,165
<b>This is extremely uncomfortable.</b>

390
00:35:57,739 --> 00:35:59,340
<b>There were a lot of pretty things there.</b>

391
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:01,300
<b>- Show me the stuff... - What should I do?</b>

392
00:36:01,309 --> 00:36:03,035
<b>behind where Seo Woo was standing.</b>

393
00:36:18,793 --> 00:36:21,155
<b>The top shelf in front of Seo Woo.</b>

394
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:24,430
<b>That's a diffuser that I like. Buy one.</b>

395
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:26,025
<b>I can't afford it.</b>

396
00:36:26,401 --> 00:36:29,195
<b>- I don't need it. - It's for me.</b>

397
00:36:29,837 --> 00:36:31,970
<b>That candle has a nice scent.</b>

398
00:36:31,973 --> 00:36:33,635
<b>I don't need a candle.</b>

399
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,405
<b>Sorry, Seo Woo.</b>

400
00:36:36,911 --> 00:36:37,970
<b>Let's go.</b>

401
00:36:37,979 --> 00:36:41,875
<b>What's that behind you? The thing that's sparkling.</b>

402
00:36:42,183 --> 00:36:43,805
<b>Stickers.</b>

403
00:36:47,388 --> 00:36:51,485
<b>Not this. This one is prettier.</b>

404
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,095
<b>Are we on the overpass?</b>

405
00:37:01,402 --> 00:37:02,895
<b>Yes.</b>

406
00:37:02,937 --> 00:37:04,430
<b>I like being here.</b>

407
00:37:04,439 --> 00:37:07,335
<b>I feel like I'm looking at the same thing as you.</b>

408
00:37:10,511 --> 00:37:12,575
<b>Are you standing side by side?</b>

409
00:37:12,747 --> 00:37:14,675
<b>Are you close?</b>

410
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:19,050
<b>I have no choice since we're sharing earphones.</b>

411
00:37:19,053 --> 00:37:22,015
<b>Seo Woo, you must be looking at Ha Won's side profile.</b>

412
00:37:24,392 --> 00:37:25,890
<b>Pretty much.</b>

413
00:37:25,893 --> 00:37:28,515
<b>And Ha Won is looking at Seo Woo's side profile.</b>

414
00:37:29,931 --> 00:37:31,425
<b>No.</b>

415
00:37:32,233 --> 00:37:35,095
<b>She's looking at me, so I see her straight on.</b>

416
00:37:36,237 --> 00:37:38,265
<b>It's my side profile now.</b>

417
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:41,840
<b>The last I saw of Ha Won was also his side profile.</b>

418
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:43,365
<b>The cafe.</b>

419
00:37:43,478 --> 00:37:46,540
<b>You ran away when you saw him inside.</b>

420
00:37:46,547 --> 00:37:48,240
<b>Let's say that's true.</b>

421
00:37:48,249 --> 00:37:50,545
<b>What does that mean?</b>

422
00:37:52,453 --> 00:37:54,320
<b>When did you see me again?</b>

423
00:37:54,322 --> 00:37:56,185
<b>The sun is setting, right?</b>

424
00:37:56,391 --> 00:37:59,185
<b>Show me what you see right now.</b>

425
00:38:11,072 --> 00:38:13,040
<b>So this is it.</b>

426
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:15,905
<b>This is how it looks when the sun sets here.</b>

427
00:38:16,311 --> 00:38:18,010
<b>I wanted to see it.</b>

428
00:38:18,012 --> 00:38:22,645
<b>I thought it would be nice to watch the sunset from there.</b>

429
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:29,415
<b>I remembered how you told me to go somewhere high up, Seo Woo.</b>

430
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:32,445
<b>And it caught my eye.</b>

431
00:38:47,442 --> 00:38:50,705
<b>It would be nice to watch the sunset from there.</b>

432
00:39:31,652 --> 00:39:34,515
<b>That's my final memory.</b>

433
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:39,285
<b>There's nothing...</b>

434
00:39:40,261 --> 00:39:42,455
<b>after that.</b>

435
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:12,445
<b>She doesn't know anything after that.</b>

436
00:40:13,861 --> 00:40:16,830
<b>She doesn't know why she sold her dishes,</b>

437
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:19,225
<b>or that she went to Norway.</b>

438
00:40:20,802 --> 00:40:22,965
<b>She doesn't know any of that.</b>

439
00:40:24,739 --> 00:40:27,095
<b>She'll find out on her own.</b>

440
00:40:30,912 --> 00:40:34,035
<b>No. Never. She can never find out.</b>

441
00:40:34,782 --> 00:40:37,945
<b>She can't find out what happens to her.</b>

442
00:40:50,431 --> 00:40:52,125
<b>Stop it.</b>

443
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,095
<b>Stop the conversations.</b>

444
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:58,270
<b>The more we talk, the more she finds out.</b>

445
00:40:58,272 --> 00:41:01,735
<b>And if we're unlucky, she'll find out everything.</b>

446
00:41:01,809 --> 00:41:03,270
<b>Why did she sell her dishes?</b>

447
00:41:03,277 --> 00:41:05,405
<b>To do something, anything.</b>

448
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:16,285
<b>She sold her dishes and went to Norway...</b>

449
00:41:16,591 --> 00:41:18,650
<b>probably because she was miserable.</b>

450
00:41:18,659 --> 00:41:20,615
<b>And you know why.</b>

451
00:41:20,761 --> 00:41:22,455
<b>Am I right?</b>

452
00:41:23,331 --> 00:41:24,985
<b>Why...</b>

453
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,295
<b>was Ji Soo hurting?</b>

454
00:41:28,703 --> 00:41:31,470
<b>She didn't want to tell you.</b>

455
00:41:31,472 --> 00:41:33,435
<b>Don't try to find out.</b>

456
00:41:39,981 --> 00:41:43,805
<b>She'll find out everything! Don't do it!</b>

457
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:50,190
<b>If Ji Soo isn't here, neither is the reason for her misery.</b>

458
00:41:50,191 --> 00:41:52,560
<b>There's nothing here. She's gone.</b>

459
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,055
<b>That's what it means to be gone.</b>

460
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:03,265
<b>She isn't gone just because I can't see her.</b>

461
00:42:04,572 --> 00:42:06,365
<b>She's here...</b>

462
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,035
<b>to me.</b>

463
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:10,910
<b>That's a delusion that only idiots have.</b>

464
00:42:10,912 --> 00:42:14,035
<b>So is an unrequited love.</b>

465
00:42:24,892 --> 00:42:26,585
<b>Seo Woo.</b>

466
00:42:27,428 --> 00:42:29,055
<b>I mean...</b>

467
00:42:51,452 --> 00:42:53,245
<b>Stop it.</b>

468
00:42:53,788 --> 00:42:58,985
<b>You spoiled brats. I'm doing my best.</b>

469
00:42:59,093 --> 00:43:03,925
<b>I'm coaxing those hypersensitive jerks.</b>

470
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:07,795
<b>I'll do it this time for sure. I...</b>

471
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:11,325
<b>This way.</b>

472
00:43:53,948 --> 00:43:55,180
<b>(2:09am)</b>

473
00:43:55,182 --> 00:43:56,675
<b>(2:10am)</b>

474
00:44:18,039 --> 00:44:20,935
<b>(Before Dawn)</b>

475
00:44:34,121 --> 00:44:37,585
<b>I don't know if this will make any sense,</b>

476
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:41,955
<b>but the two things I heard most were...</b>

477
00:44:43,731 --> 00:44:46,025
<b>to forget Ji Soo...</b>

478
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:48,895
<b>and to quit.</b>

479
00:44:51,272 --> 00:44:52,965
<b>But...</b>

480
00:44:53,841 --> 00:44:56,305
<b>I don't know what that means.</b>

481
00:45:00,448 --> 00:45:03,845
<b>What must I do to forget and quit?</b>

482
00:45:08,022 --> 00:45:10,185
<b>She was there even when she was gone,</b>

483
00:45:11,258 --> 00:45:13,385
<b>and she was there even when I couldn't see her.</b>

484
00:45:15,463 --> 00:45:18,125
<b>How could I explain that?</b>

485
00:45:20,401 --> 00:45:23,565
<b>I don't know how to explain it,</b>

486
00:45:23,637 --> 00:45:26,025
<b>so I never tell anyone.</b>

487
00:45:31,712 --> 00:45:33,505
<b>I'm just saying.</b>

488
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:42,475
<b>It's different from your unrequited love.</b>

489
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:45,090
<b>Yes, it's different.</b>

490
00:45:45,092 --> 00:45:47,515
<b>I do it for myself.</b>

491
00:45:47,728 --> 00:45:50,925
<b>To make myself happy.</b>

492
00:45:51,732 --> 00:45:54,355
<b>It's completely different from you.</b>

493
00:46:03,277 --> 00:46:05,605
<b>You can't stand not knowing something, can you?</b>

494
00:46:09,650 --> 00:46:12,045
<b>Ji Soo said...</b>

495
00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:14,675
<b>her husband made a mistake.</b>

496
00:46:15,890 --> 00:46:17,685
<b>That's why...</b>

497
00:46:17,992 --> 00:46:21,755
<b>it was too hard to bear, so she didn't leave home.</b>

498
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:25,725
<b>She wanted to do something, so she sold her dishes.</b>

499
00:46:27,401 --> 00:46:29,895
<b>That's all that I know.</b>

500
00:46:30,738 --> 00:46:34,295
<b>To be exact, this is the entire reason...</b>

501
00:46:35,509 --> 00:46:39,010
<b>Ji Soo was so miserable...</b>

502
00:46:39,013 --> 00:46:40,875
<b>with her life.</b>

503
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:44,345
<b>That's why I'm telling you.</b>

504
00:46:44,418 --> 00:46:47,015
<b>Don't try to find out more.</b>

505
00:46:47,421 --> 00:46:50,015
<b>She didn't tell you,</b>

506
00:46:51,492 --> 00:46:53,655
<b>so you shouldn't know.</b>

507
00:47:35,703 --> 00:47:37,465
<b>In Wook, what...</b>

508
00:47:44,511 --> 00:47:46,475
<b>If you're going to go behind my back,</b>

509
00:47:49,149 --> 00:47:50,450
<b>at least do it right.</b>

510
00:47:50,451 --> 00:47:53,150
<b>We were... Why didn't you tell him?</b>

511
00:47:53,153 --> 00:47:54,520
<b>You said you told him.</b>

512
00:47:54,521 --> 00:47:56,515
<b>I did not.</b>

513
00:47:56,557 --> 00:47:59,685
<b>You should've told him. You're so mean.</b>

514
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,720
<b>What are you talking about, Mr. Song?</b>

515
00:48:01,729 --> 00:48:04,325
<b>You said let's do it without Mr. Kang.</b>

516
00:48:16,677 --> 00:48:18,905
<b>What brings you here?</b>

517
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:20,875
<b>The studio.</b>

518
00:48:21,248 --> 00:48:23,175
<b>Okay. I'll open it for you.</b>

519
00:48:31,458 --> 00:48:33,385
<b>Is it locked?</b>

520
00:48:34,128 --> 00:48:35,655
<b>Give me a minute.</b>

521
00:49:01,221 --> 00:49:02,620
<b>Are you at work?</b>

522
00:49:02,623 --> 00:49:04,985
<b>I think the door is locked from the inside.</b>

523
00:49:05,292 --> 00:49:06,785
<b>What time is it?</b>

524
00:49:07,161 --> 00:49:08,755
<b>What time is it?</b>

525
00:49:10,631 --> 00:49:12,125
<b>I'm...</b>

526
00:49:19,139 --> 00:49:21,540
<b>I'm really sorry,</b>

527
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:23,910
<b>but can you go somewhere...</b>

528
00:49:23,911 --> 00:49:26,180
<b>for just 30 minutes?</b>

529
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:27,540
<b>I need to go save someone's life.</b>

530
00:49:27,548 --> 00:49:29,475
<b>I'll come right back and let you in.</b>

531
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:33,020
<b>I'll text you the code as soon as I get there.</b>

532
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:34,615
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

533
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:47,595
<b>Don't try to find out more.</b>

534
00:49:47,601 --> 00:49:49,500
<b>She didn't tell you,</b>

535
00:49:49,503 --> 00:49:51,365
<b>so you shouldn't know.</b>

536
00:50:05,652 --> 00:50:09,120
<b>Oh my gosh. Oh no.</b>

537
00:50:09,123 --> 00:50:11,690
<b>I can usually handle my alcohol.</b>

538
00:50:11,692 --> 00:50:14,160
<b>I'm quitting drinking. I won't drink anymore.</b>

539
00:50:14,161 --> 00:50:16,055
<b>Do you expect me to believe that?</b>

540
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:18,525
<b>Thanks.</b>

541
00:50:18,832 --> 00:50:19,930
<b>If you had texted me the code,</b>

542
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:22,495
<b>I could've let Mr. Kang in and then come over.</b>

543
00:50:23,070 --> 00:50:25,965
<b>- Who? - Mr. Kang's waiting.</b>

544
00:50:26,373 --> 00:50:27,935
<b>Hold on.</b>

545
00:50:30,711 --> 00:50:32,905
<b>He texted me yesterday.</b>

546
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:35,175
<b>I even replied.</b>

547
00:50:35,883 --> 00:50:37,705
<b>But I remember none of it.</b>

548
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:40,920
<b>My hard work was worth it. Right?</b>

549
00:50:40,921 --> 00:50:43,985
<b>- The code. - Oh no.</b>

550
00:50:44,091 --> 00:50:46,085
<b>Okay. I sent it.</b>

551
00:50:46,927 --> 00:50:48,455
<b>See?</b>

552
00:50:49,063 --> 00:50:51,330
<b>Why... Why am I here?</b>

553
00:50:51,331 --> 00:50:53,800
<b>- Isn't this your place? - I don't have a place in Seoul.</b>

554
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:56,500
<b>Look at the mess.</b>

555
00:50:56,503 --> 00:50:59,840
<b>Is this the bedroom, living room, or kitchen?</b>

556
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:02,400
<b>I'm going now. Mr. Kang is really mad.</b>

557
00:51:02,409 --> 00:51:04,005
<b>I'll call a cab.</b>

558
00:51:04,912 --> 00:51:06,465
<b>Wait for me.</b>

559
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:42,080
<b>There's someone here.</b>

560
00:51:42,082 --> 00:51:44,705
<b>- Who? - The cab's here.</b>

561
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:48,780
<b>That's my uncle.</b>

562
00:51:48,789 --> 00:51:50,790
<b>It's okay. Ask him...</b>

563
00:51:50,791 --> 00:51:53,660
<b>to leave nicely, and he will.</b>

564
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:55,020
<b>He's easy-going.</b>

565
00:51:55,028 --> 00:51:57,590
<b>Or I can take care of it once I get there.</b>

566
00:51:57,598 --> 00:52:00,760
<b>Give me five minutes. I'll be right there.</b>

567
00:52:00,767 --> 00:52:02,355
<b>Okay.</b>

568
00:52:03,170 --> 00:52:05,565
<b>Why was he working all night long?</b>

569
00:52:06,807 --> 00:52:08,300
<b>Why else?</b>

570
00:52:08,308 --> 00:52:10,905
<b>He was fixated on someone's misery.</b>

571
00:52:30,531 --> 00:52:32,490
<b>Uncle, please go out.</b>

572
00:52:32,499 --> 00:52:35,195
<b>Mr. Kang's there. Let him in.</b>

573
00:52:42,209 --> 00:52:43,870
<b>He's too sensitive to say anything first.</b>

574
00:52:43,877 --> 00:52:45,965
<b>You do it. Now.</b>

575
00:52:49,183 --> 00:52:50,805
<b>What are you waiting for? Get in.</b>

576
00:52:51,852 --> 00:52:54,720
<b>I left my phone.</b>

577
00:52:54,721 --> 00:52:56,315
<b>Hurry up.</b>

578
00:53:29,690 --> 00:53:31,245
<b>Ji Soo.</b>

579
00:53:31,558 --> 00:53:33,985
<b>Guess where I am right now.</b>

580
00:53:50,410 --> 00:53:52,005
<b>Ji Soo.</b>

581
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:55,175
<b>Stop the music.</b>

582
00:54:09,062 --> 00:54:11,525
<b>You said you never saw Ha Won's place, right?</b>

583
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:14,095
<b>I did.</b>

584
00:54:19,039 --> 00:54:21,735
<b>What did I see in there?</b>

585
00:54:24,011 --> 00:54:26,665
<b>I saw you everywhere.</b>

586
00:54:33,053 --> 00:54:34,615
<b>But...</b>

587
00:54:35,889 --> 00:54:37,685
<b>this isn't right.</b>

588
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:51,530
<b>I hear you're taking In Wook out. How could you do that?</b>

589
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:54,635
<b>Who said that? No one told me.</b>

590
00:54:55,342 --> 00:54:58,305
<b>I heard your wife was traveling. Is she not back yet?</b>

591
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:06,605
<b>Did she go to meet her first love or something?</b>

592
00:55:07,621 --> 00:55:09,890
<b>- If I could apologize... - To whom?</b>

593
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:11,945
<b>What if I could apologize to Won?</b>

594
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:15,715
<b>You don't keep in touch with him.</b>

595
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:46,745
<b>2209-0696.</b>

596
00:56:01,508 --> 00:56:03,805
<b>2209-0696.</b>

597
00:56:04,811 --> 00:56:07,075
<b>Excuse me. May I use your phone?</b>

598
00:56:07,547 --> 00:56:10,035
<b>I'm sorry, but we don't have one.</b>

599
00:56:11,952 --> 00:56:13,545
<b>I'm sorry, but...</b>

600
00:56:16,390 --> 00:56:18,290
<b>can you call this number...</b>

601
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:20,555
<b>and check whether it's a man or a woman?</b>

602
00:56:20,961 --> 00:56:22,515
<b>Me?</b>

603
00:56:25,732 --> 00:56:28,455
<b>Just check whether it's a man or a woman.</b>

604
00:56:38,211 --> 00:56:40,505
<b>If a man picks up,</b>

605
00:56:42,883 --> 00:56:45,305
<b>please ask if he's Ha Won.</b>

606
00:56:55,362 --> 00:56:56,925
<b>Never mind.</b>

607
00:56:58,899 --> 00:57:00,395
<b>Never mind.</b>

608
00:57:02,702 --> 00:57:06,165
<b>Sir! You forgot...</b>

609
00:57:11,578 --> 00:57:13,775
<b>Stop it already.</b>

610
00:57:14,981 --> 00:57:16,945
<b>Just...</b>

611
00:57:22,222 --> 00:57:25,045
<b>let me be sad. I'm begging you.</b>

612
00:57:50,383 --> 00:57:52,550
<b>Maybe she'll come back if she's miserable.</b>

613
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:55,175
<b>Maybe she'll call if she's hurting.</b>

614
00:57:55,288 --> 00:57:58,545
<b>Possibilities. A sliver of hope.</b>

615
00:57:59,292 --> 00:58:01,055
<b>Stop it.</b>

616
00:58:02,162 --> 00:58:05,825
<b>Stop your neverending unrequited love.</b>

617
00:58:06,633 --> 00:58:08,660
<b>That's right. You said you didn't know...</b>

618
00:58:08,668 --> 00:58:11,725
<b>what it means to stop and why you should, right?</b>

619
00:58:12,472 --> 00:58:14,500
<b>My unrequited love...</b>

620
00:58:14,508 --> 00:58:17,405
<b>has at least one percent chance.</b>

621
00:58:17,711 --> 00:58:20,205
<b>Who says I have one percent?</b>

622
00:58:21,281 --> 00:58:23,475
<b>You're alive.</b>

623
00:58:26,119 --> 00:58:28,420
<b>You don't even have one percent.</b>

624
00:58:28,421 --> 00:58:30,685
<b>So stop it.</b>

625
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:35,355
<b>I'm sorry, but...</b>

626
00:58:36,062 --> 00:58:38,385
<b>I know I should be sorry, but...</b>

627
00:58:39,032 --> 00:58:41,795
<b>So I'll stop too.</b>

628
00:58:42,002 --> 00:58:45,670
<b>I'm stopping because I have only one percent. You...</b>

629
00:58:45,672 --> 00:58:48,395
<b>You should've stopped a while ago.</b>

630
00:59:51,738 --> 00:59:53,725
<b>Where did she disappear to?</b>

631
01:00:45,358 --> 01:00:46,985
<b>I hear you're miserable.</b>

632
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:48,960
<b>I'm doing well.</b>

633
01:00:48,962 --> 01:00:52,730
<b>I'm sufficiently miserable and sufficiently happy.</b>

634
01:00:52,732 --> 01:00:56,395
<b>She'll find out everything! Don't do it!</b>

635
01:00:58,972 --> 01:01:02,740
<b>If Ji Soo isn't here, neither is the reason for her misery.</b>

636
01:01:02,742 --> 01:01:05,210
<b>There's nothing here. She's gone.</b>

637
01:01:05,211 --> 01:01:07,675
<b>That's what it means to be gone.</b>

638
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:12,505
<b>My unrequited love has at least one percent chance.</b>

639
01:01:14,287 --> 01:01:16,315
<b>You're alive.</b>

640
01:01:23,363 --> 01:01:25,125
<b>Are you alone?</b>

641
01:01:25,331 --> 01:01:27,125
<b>Yes.</b>

642
01:01:28,702 --> 01:01:31,165
<b>There's something I wanted to do for you.</b>

643
01:01:31,771 --> 01:01:33,665
<b>What?</b>

644
01:01:38,912 --> 01:01:41,575
<b>I want to hug you.</b>

645
01:01:43,083 --> 01:01:44,910
<b>But it's...</b>

646
01:01:44,918 --> 01:01:46,650
<b>You're so random.</b>

647
01:01:46,653 --> 01:01:48,715
<b>I want to hug you...</b>

648
01:01:49,222 --> 01:01:51,745
<b>and pat you on the back.</b>

649
01:01:54,661 --> 01:01:56,555
<b>Scream.</b>

650
01:01:57,831 --> 01:02:00,125
<b>What's gotten into you?</b>

651
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:03,100
<b>Scream loudly.</b>

652
01:02:03,103 --> 01:02:04,765
<b>Do it.</b>

653
01:02:09,309 --> 01:02:11,305
<b>More.</b>

654
01:02:14,781 --> 01:02:16,535
<b>That's it.</b>

655
01:02:18,651 --> 01:02:22,315
<b>When you said you'd talk to me just once,</b>

656
01:02:22,889 --> 01:02:25,785
<b>there was something I wanted to hear from you...</b>

657
01:02:28,061 --> 01:02:30,825
<b>and something I wanted to tell you.</b>

658
01:02:34,701 --> 01:02:38,365
<b>I thought a lot about what I should say.</b>

659
01:02:39,072 --> 01:02:40,865
<b>And?</b>

660
01:02:41,708 --> 01:02:44,235
<b>I'll say what I wanted to tell you.</b>

661
01:02:50,917 --> 01:02:52,550
<b>When I say this,</b>

662
01:02:52,552 --> 01:02:57,015
<b>it feels like I'm hugging you.</b>

663
01:02:58,191 --> 01:02:59,885
<b>What is it?</b>

664
01:03:03,863 --> 01:03:06,325
<b>What I used to say...</b>

665
01:03:08,268 --> 01:03:10,055
<b>whenever you were hurting...</b>

666
01:03:10,370 --> 01:03:12,165
<b>or depressed.</b>

667
01:03:16,442 --> 01:03:18,365
<b>Ji Soo.</b>

668
01:03:19,579 --> 01:03:21,475
<b>Ji Soo.</b>

669
01:03:22,482 --> 01:03:24,575
<b>Ji Soo.</b>

670
01:03:25,018 --> 01:03:26,705
<b>Ji Soo?</b>

671
01:03:34,828 --> 01:03:36,655
<b>Ji Soo.</b>

672
01:03:37,497 --> 01:03:39,325
<b>Ji Soo.</b>

673
01:03:40,633 --> 01:03:42,395
<b>Ji Soo.</b>

674
01:03:45,171 --> 01:03:47,065
<b>Ji Soo.</b>

675
01:03:51,611 --> 01:03:53,265
<b>Ji Soo.</b>

676
01:03:58,051 --> 01:03:59,745
<b>Rest...</b>

677
01:04:01,788 --> 01:04:03,415
<b>in peace.</b>

678
01:05:16,162 --> 01:05:18,830
<b>(A Piece of Your Mind)</b>

679
01:05:18,831 --> 01:05:21,200
<b>What kind of music do you want to listen to?</b>

680
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:23,770
<b>I guess you missed Before Dawn a lot. Me.</b>

681
01:05:23,770 --> 01:05:24,870
<b>The last room is vacant, right?</b>

682
01:05:24,871 --> 01:05:27,900
<b>We have to be careful about who we take in.</b>

683
01:05:27,907 --> 01:05:30,810
<b>I wonder how Seo Woo's one percent will grow.</b>

684
01:05:30,810 --> 01:05:32,210
<b>I'll raise him to be strong.</b>

685
01:05:32,211 --> 01:05:34,080
<b>Who do you think you are?</b>

686
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:37,250
<b>In Wook. You need to stop treating people this way.</b>

687
01:05:37,250 --> 01:05:38,850
<b>Are you stupid?</b>

688
01:05:38,851 --> 01:05:41,415
<b>How can a person not cry?</b>

689
01:05:41,421 --> 01:05:43,380
<b>Don't you have anything to say to Before Dawn?</b>

690
01:05:43,389 --> 01:05:45,090
<b>Thank you,</b>

691
01:05:45,091 --> 01:05:46,785
<b>Ha Won.</b>
