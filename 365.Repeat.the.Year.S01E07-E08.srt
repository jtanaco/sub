<b>When will you leave the country?</b>

457
00:27:06,019 --> 00:27:07,420
<b>I'll start getting ready.</b>

458
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:11,359
<b>I'll only think about my family
once I move to Canada.</b>

459
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,059
<b>I could deal with getting fired
and becoming penniless,</b>

460
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:18,430
<b>but I couldn't take getting divorced
and never seeing my daughter again.</b>

461
00:27:18,529 --> 00:27:21,000
<b>The older you get,
the more important your family is.</b>

462
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:24,339
<b>Be good to your family
while they're around and young.</b>

463
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:26,079
<b>How's your wife?</b>

464
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:29,210
<b>She still recognizes me.</b>

465
00:27:30,349 --> 00:27:33,279
<b>But she'll soon ask,
"Who are you, old man?"</b>

466
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,650
<b>Wait, is she...</b>

467
00:27:36,089 --> 00:27:37,990
<b>She's at a sanatorium.</b>

468
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:43,190
<b>It would be great
if things would always be like this.</b>

469
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:46,400
<b>You all have a sweet family.</b>

470
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:49,630
<b>I've been preparing for the college
entrance exam for two years...</b>

471
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:50,930
<b>and became the odd one out.</b>

472
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,569
<b>Ko Jae Young,
why did you decide to reset?</b>

473
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:00,279
<b>To get my revenge.</b>

474
00:28:02,509 --> 00:28:04,180
<b>There's this guy
I really want to kill.</b>

475
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:12,119
<b>I lost to this weak guy
in a video game competition.</b>

476
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:15,259
<b>I know all of his moves,
so this time, I'll destroy him.</b>

477
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:16,679
<b>Are you a professional gamer?</b>

478
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:19,136
<b>That's why you kept saying
everything is a game...</b>

479
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,230
<b>and that you need to
keep people alive or dead.</b>

480
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:25,569
<b>By any chance,</b>

481
00:28:26,339 --> 00:28:29,269
<b>do you know what this flower is?</b>

482
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:30,769
<b>Let me see.</b>

483
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,809
<b>Goodness, these are very pretty.</b>

484
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:38,750
<b>Anyway, what are these flowers?</b>

485
00:28:40,849 --> 00:28:42,349
<b>I'm not really sure.</b>

486
00:28:46,859 --> 00:28:50,529
<b>These are too dry.
You can't even do an image search.</b>

487
00:28:51,259 --> 00:28:52,406
<b>Why do you ask?</b>

488
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:54,599
<b>I want to use it for my work.</b>

489
00:28:56,069 --> 00:28:57,269
<b>For "Hidden Killer"?</b>

490
00:28:57,730 --> 00:28:59,799
<b>Isn't that webtoon
about killing people?</b>

491
00:29:01,069 --> 00:29:03,809
<b>Yes, well. Right.</b>

492
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:07,210
<b>Ms. Shin, take a look at this.</b>

493
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:10,750
<b>My daughter drew that.</b>

494
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:13,619
<b>What do you think?
Is she talented?</b>

495
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,119
<b>Yes, it looks very cute.</b>

496
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,089
<b>Right? Isn't she promising?</b>

497
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:22,089
<b>Hey, that's so cute.</b>

498
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:25,960
<b>My daughter sent it to me
for my birthday.</b>

499
00:29:26,359 --> 00:29:29,000
<b>I might forget to bring
my wallet and phone,</b>

500
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,970
<b>but I always carry that around
with me like a talisman.</b>

501
00:29:32,299 --> 00:29:34,099
<b>It feels like
my daughter is protecting me.</b>

502
00:29:36,769 --> 00:29:39,839
<b>Goodness! Here's another guy
who's a fool for his daughter!</b>

503
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:43,055
<b>- Thank you.
- You're very good with alcohol.</b>

504
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:44,109
<b>Don't say that.</b>

505
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:48,779
<b>Since you paid for everything today,</b>

506
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:52,119
<b>I'll make sure I buy a huge meal
for everyone before I leave.</b>

507
00:29:52,819 --> 00:29:54,390
<b>How about this Saturday?</b>

508
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:55,589
<b>Sounds great.</b>

509
00:29:55,819 --> 00:29:57,960
<b>All I have is time.</b>

510
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:00,430
<b>I can make it too.</b>

511
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:02,329
<b>What about Detective Ji?</b>

512
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,599
<b>I'll... I'll call him.</b>

513
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:07,616
<b>Okay! Then it's
eleven o'clock on Saturday.</b>

514
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,609
<b>Let's meet here again.</b>

515
00:30:10,109 --> 00:30:12,269
<b>On that day,
I'll treat all of you...</b>

516
00:30:12,779 --> 00:30:16,210
<b>with a luxurious full-course dining!</b>

517
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,456
<b>- Make sure you come!
- Okay.</b>

518
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,980
<b>All right.</b>

519
00:30:21,349 --> 00:30:23,095
<b>Goodbye, then.</b>

520
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:24,150
<b>- Bye.
- Let's go.</b>

521
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:25,720
<b>- Bye.
- Goodbye.</b>

522
00:30:36,769 --> 00:30:38,430
<b>Was it just a coincidence?</b>

523
00:30:39,569 --> 00:30:41,039
<b>Was I overreacting?</b>

524
00:30:51,009 --> 00:30:54,519
<b>The characters for "Hidden Killer"
weren't this difficult to create.</b>

525
00:30:55,349 --> 00:30:56,690
<b>Isn't that so, Maru?</b>

526
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:01,289
<b>You're so cute.</b>

527
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:10,099
<b>It's something I've always done.
It's not that hard.</b>

528
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:12,740
<b>Are you back?</b>

529
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:14,869
<b>Let's meet up.</b>

530
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:17,410
<b>Yes, okay.</b>

531
00:31:18,809 --> 00:31:21,085
<b>- Yes?
- It's not the phone with a USIM,</b>

532
00:31:21,109 --> 00:31:23,549
<b>so I didn't hear who it was
or where they're meeting.</b>

533
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:25,356
<b>What about Bae Jung Tae?
Is he still at home?</b>

534
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,579
<b>Yes, he is.</b>

535
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,819
<b>I'll be there in 15 minutes.</b>

536
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:17,400
<b>I missed Bae Jung Tae.</b>

537
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,470
<b>I found something over here.</b>

538
00:32:26,759 --> 00:32:29,035
<b>You got here pretty fast
like a bullet.</b>

539
00:32:29,059 --> 00:32:31,235
<b>The photos were pretty risque
this time, weren't they?</b>

540
00:32:31,259 --> 00:32:32,976
<b>You extorted enough money out of me.</b>

541
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,669
<b>How much more do you want,
you scumbag?</b>

542
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,116
<b>That's not something
I'd like to hear...</b>

543
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:41,710
<b>from a guy who secretly met up with
his mistress on his family vacation.</b>

544
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:48,486
<b>If I were extorting money out of you
because you gambled,</b>

545
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:50,410
<b>it wouldn't feel right
for me either.</b>

546
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:52,250
<b>Should I sent these photos...</b>

547
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,096
<b>to your wife via international mail?</b>

548
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,189
<b>You know, I'm trying
very hard not to explode on you.</b>

549
00:32:58,259 --> 00:33:00,920
<b>So you have money to pay the thugs
and to put a price on my head,</b>

550
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:03,759
<b>but when I'm trying
to keep your family together,</b>

551
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,399
<b>how could you call me a scumbag?</b>

552
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:12,740
<b>The thugs keep...</b>

553
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:15,310
<b>their promises
better than a scumbag.</b>

554
00:33:15,509 --> 00:33:16,539
<b>Hey.</b>

555
00:33:17,509 --> 00:33:19,009
<b>It's been a while.</b>

556
00:33:20,479 --> 00:33:23,250
<b>There's no point talking
to jerks like you.</b>

557
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,426
<b>Where's the original copy?</b>

558
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:28,450
<b>Don't you know the world we live in?</b>

559
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:31,290
<b>Don't you know the cloud?</b>

560
00:33:32,659 --> 00:33:33,890
<b>"Cloud"?</b>

561
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:36,629
<b>Don't just stand there. Get him.</b>

562
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:43,700
<b>Hey, Jung Tae.</b>

563
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,640
<b>Doesn't this scene
look familiar to you?</b>

564
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:48,885
<b>Doesn't it? You punk.</b>

565
00:33:48,909 --> 00:33:52,256
<b>Hey, getting rid of
a scumbag like you...</b>

566
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,510
<b>doesn't even cost that much.</b>

567
00:33:56,349 --> 00:33:57,855
<b>Don't you know I can do anything...</b>

568
00:33:57,879 --> 00:33:59,355
<b>as long as I have money
in this capitalist society?</b>

569
00:33:59,379 --> 00:34:01,290
<b>- Jerk.
- My gosh.</b>

570
00:34:04,019 --> 00:34:05,635
<b>Kill me when you have the chance.</b>

571
00:34:05,659 --> 00:34:08,260
<b>Otherwise, I'll kill you
with my own hands.</b>

572
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:13,335
<b>Hey, you might not have anything
in this brain of yours.</b>

573
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:14,945
<b>But you should think, you know.</b>

574
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:16,829
<b>Calculate which one of us...</b>

575
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,640
<b>has a higher chance of dying?</b>

576
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,739
<b>You jerk. Scumbag.</b>

577
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:25,140
<b>Hey, get him out.</b>

578
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:30,950
<b>Don't come. No.</b>

579
00:34:32,479 --> 00:34:33,979
<b>If he dies,</b>

580
00:34:34,379 --> 00:34:36,289
<b>you won't get
the rest of the money.</b>

581
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,159
<b>Get that scumbag!</b>

582
00:34:42,759 --> 00:34:44,599
<b>That darned scumbag. Gosh.</b>

583
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,629
<b>You must catch him!</b>

584
00:34:49,969 --> 00:34:51,139
<b>So...</b>

585
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,800
<b>the client who hired those thugs...</b>

586
00:34:54,069 --> 00:34:55,469
<b>was Mr. Cha Jeung Seok.</b>

587
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:58,086
<b>He pretended to be a victim,</b>

588
00:34:58,110 --> 00:35:00,039
<b>but he was secretly chasing
Bae Jung Tae.</b>

589
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:06,050
<b>Do you think Ms. Lee Shin knew
about their relationship?</b>

590
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,169
<b>Is she still not back?</b>

591
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,469
<b>No.</b>

592
00:35:32,909 --> 00:35:34,479
<b>Mr. Cha Jeung Seok, are you there?</b>

593
00:35:37,509 --> 00:35:38,620
<b>Mr. Cha Jeung Seok?</b>

594
00:36:31,969 --> 00:36:32,969
<b>Do you think he'll come?</b>

595
00:36:33,469 --> 00:36:35,639
<b>- I'm not sure.
- No way!</b>

596
00:36:51,089 --> 00:36:53,490
<b>- Hello.
- Are you here alone?</b>

597
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:56,290
<b>I've been calling Mr. Cha Jeung Seok
since yesterday,</b>

598
00:36:56,389 --> 00:36:57,490
<b>but he hasn't picked up.</b>

599
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,569
<b>He has already settled the balance.
I came here because he told me to.</b>

600
00:37:02,129 --> 00:37:04,529
<b>But is he not here?</b>

601
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,170
<b>What's going on?</b>

602
00:37:23,819 --> 00:37:27,420
<b>Wait. Mr. Bae Jung Tae took these?</b>

603
00:37:28,589 --> 00:37:30,290
<b>Has he been stalking us?</b>

604
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:37,769
<b>It can't be. Then does that mean...</b>

605
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:55,860
<b>(I'll Carry You: You always sit
in the same seat. Enjoy your meal.)</b>

<b>(I'll Carry You: You always sit

607
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:12,399
<b>What? Wait.</b>

608
00:38:19,009 --> 00:38:20,980
<b>But why would he?</b>

609
00:38:21,139 --> 00:38:22,480
<b>It must be the master's plan.</b>

610
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,110
<b>Master?</b>

611
00:38:25,579 --> 00:38:27,579
<b>Ms. Lee Shin's photo isn't in there.</b>

612
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,040
<b>He's been watching
all the people who have reset,</b>

613
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:34,890
<b>but Ms. Lee Shin isn't one of them.</b>

614
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,560
<b>There's something going on
between those two.</b>

615
00:38:41,329 --> 00:38:43,370
<b>It's true...</b>

616
00:38:43,769 --> 00:38:44,849
<b>that they've been in touch.</b>

617
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,646
<b>Then we shouldn't be talking
about this here.</b>

618
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:49,886
<b>We should visit her.</b>

619
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:53,810
<b>I did, but she's abroad
due to a seminar.</b>

620
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:57,180
<b>I've checked, and she did leave.</b>

621
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:01,589
<b>About Jeung Seok's not picking up,</b>

622
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:06,389
<b>do you think it has anything to do
with Jung Tae?</b>

623
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:08,189
<b>What do you think?</b>

624
00:39:08,589 --> 00:39:09,959
<b>It's possible.</b>

625
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:12,360
<b>Or it could be the opposite.</b>

626
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,000
<b>- What?
- Opposite?</b>

627
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:17,175
<b>Mr. Cha Jeung Seok
and Mr. Bae Jung Tae...</b>

628
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:19,100
<b>knew each other
even before the reset.</b>

629
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:20,976
<b>- What?
- But why?</b>

630
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,569
<b>He's such a goodhearted man.</b>

631
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:26,009
<b>Hey, getting rid of
a scumbag like you...</b>

632
00:39:26,209 --> 00:39:27,410
<b>doesn't even cost that much.</b>

633
00:39:27,939 --> 00:39:29,339
<b>Don't you know I can do anything...</b>

634
00:39:29,379 --> 00:39:31,026
<b>as long as I have money
in this capitalist society?</b>

635
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:32,120
<b>- Jerk.
- My gosh.</b>

636
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:37,226
<b>Kill me when you have the chance.</b>

637
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:39,790
<b>Otherwise, I'll kill you
with my own hands.</b>

638
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:44,536
<b>How could that well-mannered man
say such things?</b>

639
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,660
<b>What is this?</b>

640
00:39:46,329 --> 00:39:48,670
<b>You knew about everything
and recorded their conversation.</b>

641
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:51,670
<b>That's because Bae Jung Tae
was the key suspect.</b>

642
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:55,610
<b>But I actually found out
a new side of Mr. Cha Jeung Seok.</b>

643
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:59,386
<b>He's like the villain of a PvP game.</b>

644
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:00,579
<b>What was that?</b>

645
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:03,410
<b>Hey, Soon Woo.</b>

646
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:05,850
<b>Where? Got it.</b>

647
00:40:08,019 --> 00:40:09,189
<b>I need to go.</b>

648
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,819
<b>Let me know once
you reach Mr. Cha Jeung Seok.</b>

649
00:40:26,699 --> 00:40:28,839
<b>About Jeung Seok's not picking up,</b>

650
00:40:29,269 --> 00:40:32,509
<b>do you think it has anything to do
with Jung Tae?</b>

651
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:35,480
<b>It's possible.
Or it could be the opposite.</b>

652
00:40:38,949 --> 00:40:40,120
<b>Mr. Bae Jung Tae.</b>

653
00:40:42,519 --> 00:40:43,750
<b>Mr. Bae Jung Tae.</b>

654
00:41:12,549 --> 00:41:14,320
<b>I know this makes no sense.</b>

655
00:41:14,519 --> 00:41:16,419
<b>I know I sound crazy.</b>

656
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:18,910
<b>But I think Mr. Cha Jeung Seok
is in danger.</b>

657
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:28,129
<b>Hyeong Ju, are you there?</b>

658
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:30,700
<b>Yes.</b>

659
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:49,919
<b>I got in touch with them.
They said it'll take 3 to 4 days.</b>

660
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:52,365
<b>- All right.
- We found his ID card.</b>

661
00:41:52,389 --> 00:41:53,419
<b>Thank you.</b>

662
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,960
<b>(Cha Jeung Seok)</b>

663
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:02,600
<b>What's wrong? Do you know him?</b>

664
00:42:03,169 --> 00:42:04,169
<b>Yes.</b>

665
00:42:04,629 --> 00:42:06,370
<b>He's that stock firm employee.</b>

666
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,740
<b>The one who visited you last time?</b>

667
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:16,110
<b>Do you know anything?</b>

668
00:42:18,009 --> 00:42:21,179
<b>Sir, this is the last message
he sent.</b>

669
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:26,566
<b>Honey, thank you for everything.
And I'm sorry.</b>

670
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:27,830
<b>Take good care of our daughter.</b>

671
00:42:28,019 --> 00:42:30,706
<b>I hope you'll be happy
in your next life...</b>

672
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:31,890
<b>and not meet someone like me.</b>

673
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,730
<b>He even had a daughter.</b>

674
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:41,615
<b>Did you get in touch
with his family?</b>

675
00:42:41,639 --> 00:42:44,240
<b>I got in touch with his wife
in Canada. She's flying in.</b>

676
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:47,139
<b>She seemed quite calm.</b>

677
00:42:47,409 --> 00:42:49,056
<b>They had been living apart
for over five years.</b>

678
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:51,279
<b>She had asked him for a divorce.</b>

679
00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:54,355
<b>It's true that they weren't close.</b>

680
00:42:54,379 --> 00:42:56,226
<b>But he was planning
to move to Canada.</b>

681
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:57,919
<b>That's why he quit his work.</b>

682
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,696
<b>That's not what Soon Woo said.</b>

683
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:02,759
<b>The private equity fund that
he was in charge of had many issues.</b>

684
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:05,159
<b>When I was there,
the investors were causing a scene.</b>

685
00:43:05,659 --> 00:43:08,375
<b>The company believes he quit
after realizing...</b>

686
00:43:08,399 --> 00:43:10,200
<b>the details about
the distressed-debt.</b>

687
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:12,139
<b>- That's not why.
- Then what is it?</b>

688
00:43:13,039 --> 00:43:14,440
<b>Do you know something?</b>

689
00:43:18,909 --> 00:43:20,316
<b>He didn't commit suicide.</b>

690
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:21,985
<b>Given the circumstances,
it wasn't an accident.</b>

691
00:43:22,009 --> 00:43:23,649
<b>Are you saying he was murdered?</b>

692
00:43:24,379 --> 00:43:25,726
<b>The owner of a store nearby
testified...</b>

693
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:27,755
<b>that Cha Jeung Seok purchased
charcoal briquettes from him.</b>

694
00:43:27,779 --> 00:43:29,739
<b>And we found no traces
of other people in his car.</b>

695
00:43:30,519 --> 00:43:33,620
<b>The message he had sent to his wife
sounds like a suicide note as well.</b>

696
00:43:33,789 --> 00:43:36,035
<b>His black box and the CCTV cameras
showed nothing in particular...</b>

697
00:43:36,059 --> 00:43:37,429
<b>after his arrival at the scene.</b>

698
00:43:39,029 --> 00:43:42,600
<b>Let's put this case on hold
until we get the autopsy results.</b>

699
00:43:43,299 --> 00:43:46,139
<b>If you want to reinvestigate
this case,</b>

700
00:43:46,269 --> 00:43:47,669
<b>bring me proof that this is murder.</b>

701
00:43:53,509 --> 00:43:54,855
<b>Don't you know I can do anything...</b>

702
00:43:54,879 --> 00:43:56,686
<b>as long as I have money
in this capitalist society?</b>

703
00:43:56,710 --> 00:43:58,519
<b>You little jerk.</b>

704
00:44:00,450 --> 00:44:01,966
<b>Kill me when you have the chance.</b>

705
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:04,519
<b>Otherwise, I'll kill you
with my own hands.</b>

706
00:44:06,690 --> 00:44:07,895
<b>- What is this?
- It's Cha Jeung Seok...</b>

707
00:44:07,919 --> 00:44:08,929
<b>and Bae Jung Tae.</b>

708
00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:10,429
<b>- So?
- Sun Ho.</b>

709
00:44:10,889 --> 00:44:12,830
<b>Cha Jeung Seok
would've never killed himself.</b>

710
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:15,275
<b>I'm sure there's something going on
between him and Bae Jung Tae.</b>

711
00:44:15,299 --> 00:44:17,299
<b>We need to investigate him first.</b>

712
00:44:19,169 --> 00:44:20,200
<b>I see.</b>

713
00:44:21,370 --> 00:44:22,539
<b>Where did you get this?</b>

714
00:44:25,309 --> 00:44:27,009
<b>Did you wiretap Bae Jung Tae?</b>

715
00:44:28,509 --> 00:44:30,155
<b>If this was illegal,
you won't get away...</b>

716
00:44:30,179 --> 00:44:31,285
<b>with just being disciplined.</b>

717
00:44:31,309 --> 00:44:32,796
<b>- You'll be brought to court.
- Sun Ho...</b>

718
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:36,750
<b>I don't know why you're so obsessed
with Bae Jung Tae.</b>

719
00:44:36,889 --> 00:44:39,265
<b>But even if this wasn't illegal,</b>

720
00:44:39,289 --> 00:44:42,365
<b>you know very well
that it doesn't prove...</b>

721
00:44:42,389 --> 00:44:43,589
<b>that he didn't commit suicide.</b>

722
00:44:52,139 --> 00:44:54,275
<b>- Of course, I do.
- You better not mention this...</b>

723
00:44:54,299 --> 00:44:55,570
<b>to Captain Heo.</b>

724
00:44:56,409 --> 00:44:57,470
<b>You'll get in trouble.</b>

725
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,400
<b>I'm going to pretend
like I didn't hear anything.</b>

726
00:45:15,059 --> 00:45:16,059
<b>Ga Hyeon.</b>

727
00:45:18,159 --> 00:45:20,559
<b>Is it really Mr. Cha Jeung Seok?
How did he die?</b>

728
00:45:22,269 --> 00:45:23,299
<b>He committed suicide.</b>

729
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,139
<b>That can't be.</b>

730
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:29,840
<b>By the way,</b>

731
00:45:30,409 --> 00:45:33,110
<b>You said he could be in danger.</b>

732
00:45:33,639 --> 00:45:35,149
<b>What made you think that?</b>

733
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:38,210
<b>It's not just the two of them now.</b>

734
00:45:50,090 --> 00:45:52,170
<b>This was also in front
of Mr. Cha Jeung Seok's house.</b>

735
00:45:54,129 --> 00:45:57,070
<b>All three of them received
a bouquet of flowers.</b>

736
00:46:05,879 --> 00:46:07,879
<b>No, not you too. You're scaring me.</b>

737
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:11,686
<b>Is it like a warning
the Master is sending us?</b>

738
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:13,250
<b>Come on, stop that!</b>

739
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:17,090
<b>I can't even believe...</b>

740
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:19,090
<b>that he committed suicide.</b>

741
00:46:21,090 --> 00:46:23,590
<b>That can't be.
I'm sure it's just a coincidence.</b>

742
00:46:23,889 --> 00:46:26,960
<b>Besides, sending and receiving
bouquets of flowers is quite common.</b>

743
00:46:27,330 --> 00:46:29,330
<b>If only the dead received them,</b>

744
00:46:29,929 --> 00:46:31,070
<b>it's pretty rare.</b>

745
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,139
<b>Could it be that the bouquets
of flowers are cursed?</b>

746
00:46:36,409 --> 00:46:37,940
<b>Like the Demon's doll.</b>

747
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:43,549
<b>That is not...</b>

748
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:47,620
<b>the only strange thing.</b>

749
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:49,726
<b>Mr. Choi Kyung Man...</b>

750
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:52,059
<b>definitely bought
a lottery ticket.</b>

751
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:54,320
<b>But that disappeared
without a trace.</b>

752
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:58,135
<b>There was something off
about Ms. Seo Yeon Soo as well.</b>

753
00:46:58,159 --> 00:46:59,676
<b>Right before the estimated time
of her death,</b>

754
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:01,460
<b>she was on the phone
according to the record.</b>

755
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:03,600
<b>But her phone wasn't found
at the scene.</b>

756
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:09,139
<b>Right.</b>

about the reset.</b>

908
01:01:32,599 --> 01:01:34,345
<b>The message. What do you mean?</b>

909
01:01:34,369 --> 01:01:36,946
<b>Why do people keep dying?
You must at least know the answer.</b>

910
01:01:36,970 --> 01:01:38,515
<b>Keep playing detective.</b>

911
01:01:38,539 --> 01:01:41,315
<b>Hyeong Ju, you were sussing me out
because you don't believe me, right?</b>

912
01:01:41,339 --> 01:01:43,985
<b>Hero. I have a hero.</b>

913
01:01:44,009 --> 01:01:45,325
<b>I thought about turning myself in.</b>

914
01:01:45,349 --> 01:01:47,626
<b>It means one of us will die
in a couple of days.</b>

915
01:01:47,650 --> 01:01:50,366
<b>The reason why
Ms. Lee went through the reset.</b>

916
01:01:50,390 --> 01:01:53,019
<b>That means she's
in as much danger as we are.</b>

917
01:01:53,490 --> 01:01:54,660
<b>Isn't this why?</b>
