<b>(Episode 3)</b>

2
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,716
<b>Let me ask you one thing.</b>

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,391
<b>For someone who used to be
a loan shark and rogue,</b>

4
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:18,632
<b>how did you make it as a city
councilor?</b>

5
00:00:19,015 --> 00:00:20,797
<b>What do you think...</b>

6
00:00:20,929 --> 00:00:24,896
<b>politicians who have little to do
and much time do in the countryside?</b>

7
00:00:25,555 --> 00:00:26,949
<b>You know what I'm talking about.</b>

8
00:00:27,133 --> 00:00:29,805
<b>- I can help you with that.
- Gosh.</b>

9
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,894
<b>Those guys are not what I want.</b>

10
00:00:33,188 --> 00:00:34,890
<b>I need real guys.</b>

11
00:00:35,094 --> 00:00:37,852
<b>Young guys who really know nothing
about these things.</b>

12
00:00:59,245 --> 00:01:03,163
<b>(Oh, you're a junior
from Jaeil High School.)</b>

13
00:01:32,218 --> 00:01:33,328
<b>(The Limits of Poetic License)</b>

14
00:01:33,352 --> 00:01:36,301
<b>In this way,
poetic license refers...</b>

15
00:01:36,325 --> 00:01:39,176
<b>to a deviation from fact or form
for artistic purposes...</b>

16
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,434
<b>even though it may be grammatically
incorrect.</b>

17
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,751
<b>It allows spacing words
and ungrammatical sentences...</b>

18
00:01:45,775 --> 00:01:48,137
<b>Having Kim Dae Yong is enough...</b>

19
00:01:49,421 --> 00:01:50,906
<b>and now Heo Don Hyuk.</b>

20
00:01:52,141 --> 00:01:54,119
<b>I must be jinxed.</b>

21
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,947
<b>How do you know that sentence?</b>

22
00:01:59,477 --> 00:02:00,947
<b>What sentence do you mean?</b>

23
00:02:00,971 --> 00:02:03,020
<b>"Wet sand remembers
one's footprints."</b>

24
00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:07,005
<b>- How do you know that?
- I heard it at the flower bed...</b>

25
00:02:07,054 --> 00:02:08,367
<b>from that girl.</b>

26
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:12,689
<b>- Can you prove it?
- I mean it.</b>

27
00:02:13,242 --> 00:02:14,868
<b>I swear I heard it then.</b>

28
00:02:15,921 --> 00:02:19,025
<b>If I find out it's a lie,
you're dead.</b>

29
00:02:24,008 --> 00:02:27,622
<b>- Attention. As of now...
- You're not allowed to play here.</b>

30
00:02:27,836 --> 00:02:29,810
<b>It's dangerous up there.
Please get down.</b>

31
00:02:31,055 --> 00:02:34,078
<b>Those who overuse poetic license
as a way...</b>

32
00:02:34,102 --> 00:02:36,203
<b>to cover up their inadequate writing
skills...</b>

33
00:02:36,547 --> 00:02:39,205
<b>will have to pay its price.</b>

34
00:02:39,531 --> 00:02:42,207
<b>See you somewhere quiet,
after school.</b>

35
00:02:43,242 --> 00:02:44,719
<b>This type of people...</b>

36
00:02:45,344 --> 00:02:48,073
<b>all likes the word "quiet."</b>

37
00:02:49,477 --> 00:02:50,673
<b>They say: "Be quiet."</b>

38
00:02:50,828 --> 00:02:53,209
<b>Or:
"Shut your mouth and keep quiet."</b>

39
00:02:53,233 --> 00:02:54,286
<b>Hey, Poet Park.</b>

40
00:02:55,094 --> 00:02:57,729
<b>- Let's talk, somewhere quiet.
- No!</b>

41
00:02:59,336 --> 00:03:00,347
<b>Sorry?</b>

42
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,594
<b>It's nothing.</b>

43
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:08,505
<b>What did I tell you? You should
always keep writing.</b>

44
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,048
<b>It's hard to get inspiration.</b>

45
00:03:11,072 --> 00:03:13,742
<b>How many times have I told you
Mr. Inspiration doesn't come easy?</b>

46
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:15,195
<b>What happened to your face?</b>

47
00:03:16,852 --> 00:03:18,429
<b>Well, it's...</b>

48
00:03:19,047 --> 00:03:20,703
<b>I'm getting my wisdom tooth.</b>

49
00:03:21,354 --> 00:03:23,274
<b>You should get your wisdom tooth
pulled out soon.</b>

50
00:03:24,281 --> 00:03:26,383
<b>Hey, wisdom tooth.
That's a good idea.</b>

51
00:03:26,407 --> 00:03:28,947
<b>- Write a piece about wisdom tooth.
- Pardon?</b>

52
00:03:28,971 --> 00:03:30,648
<b>I'll give you a week, okay?</b>

53
00:03:31,203 --> 00:03:34,578
<b>- Got it? I'm giving you one week.
- Okay.</b>

54
00:03:36,937 --> 00:03:40,047
<b>I have something to discuss
with you...</b>

55
00:03:41,047 --> 00:03:43,784
<b>- regarding writing poems.
- I see. What is it?</b>

56
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:45,604
<b>I can't tell you here.</b>

57
00:03:45,797 --> 00:03:47,320
<b>Could we go somewhere quiet?</b>

58
00:03:47,409 --> 00:03:48,845
<b>Do you want to have dinner with me?</b>

59
00:03:48,869 --> 00:03:50,684
<b>Yes, I'd love to!</b>

60
00:03:52,561 --> 00:03:54,625
<b>- Oh, Miss.
- Yes.</b>

61
00:03:54,656 --> 00:03:56,421
<b>- Where are you headed?
- Oh, we were...</b>

62
00:03:56,734 --> 00:03:59,608
<b>going to discuss her plans
for college over dinner.</b>

63
00:03:59,678 --> 00:04:03,070
<b>What a coincidence. I was just about
to have dinner with Writer Park.</b>

64
00:04:04,076 --> 00:04:06,523
<b>You should join us.
Our two heroes as well.</b>

65
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:09,993
<b>Yes, why don't we?</b>

66
00:04:10,017 --> 00:04:12,146
<b>It'll be good.
You guys know each other.</b>

67
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:13,799
<b>Yes, I'm fine with it.</b>

68
00:04:14,314 --> 00:04:15,655
<b>- How about you, Writer Park?
- Yes.</b>

69
00:04:15,679 --> 00:04:18,659
<b>I am a visible ninja.</b>

70
00:04:19,024 --> 00:04:22,990
<b>- What is it?
- Oh, I just remembered...</b>

71
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:27,273
<b>I promised to go somewhere
with Heo Don Hyuk today.</b>

72
00:04:28,096 --> 00:04:30,828
<b>- Can't you go there another time?
- I'm sorry.</b>

73
00:04:43,453 --> 00:04:44,540
<b>Hurry up.</b>

74
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:46,890
<b>Okay.</b>

75
00:05:12,336 --> 00:05:13,517
<b>Hey, where are you?</b>

76
00:05:14,008 --> 00:05:15,453
<b>I saw Iron Man take you.</b>

77
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:16,966
<b>Text me if something comes up.</b>

78
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:19,828
<b>Text any word if you're in danger.</b>

79
00:05:21,469 --> 00:05:24,016
<b>Come in. I live alone.</b>

80
00:05:26,992 --> 00:05:28,132
<b>Alone?</b>

81
00:06:09,781 --> 00:06:11,016
<b>It's cold.</b>

82
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:15,188
<b>I bet the house isn't soundproof.</b>

83
00:06:15,671 --> 00:06:17,968
<b>You must hear everything
from the other rooms.</b>

84
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:20,590
<b>I hope anyone who lives next door...</b>

85
00:06:20,614 --> 00:06:22,437
<b>can hear me when I scream.</b>

86
00:06:22,461 --> 00:06:24,204
<b>("Wet sand remembers
one's footsteps.")</b>

87
00:06:30,422 --> 00:06:33,047
<b>Is Seo Jung's boyfriend
that King Psycho mentioned...</b>

88
00:06:33,781 --> 00:06:34,922
<b>Heo Don Hyuk?</b>

89
00:06:49,383 --> 00:06:50,383
<b>Sit down.</b>

90
00:07:07,289 --> 00:07:08,891
<b>When I watch movies from now on...</b>

91
00:07:09,123 --> 00:07:11,539
<b>I think I'll understand what
the culprit is thinking.</b>

92
00:07:12,062 --> 00:07:13,117
<b>Tell me...</b>

93
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,539
<b>anything you remember.</b>

94
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,523
<b>That day,</b>

95
00:07:23,805 --> 00:07:25,983
<b>Kyung Pyo hid...</b>

96
00:07:26,411 --> 00:07:29,537
<b>my cellphone so I went around
looking for it.</b>

97
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:39,717
<b>I saw Seo Jung at the flower bed.</b>

98
00:07:39,741 --> 00:07:41,467
<b>Excuse me, did you...</b>

99
00:07:42,883 --> 00:07:44,022
<b>What else?</b>

100
00:07:45,383 --> 00:07:47,075
<b>She wore dirty sneakers...</b>

101
00:07:49,492 --> 00:07:51,470
<b>- and had a pink cellphone.
- A cellphone?</b>

102
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,842
<b>- She had a cellphone?
- Yes.</b>

103
00:07:57,836 --> 00:07:58,843
<b>Iron Man.</b>

104
00:08:00,344 --> 00:08:02,302
<b>It had an Iron Man figurine on it.</b>

105
00:08:07,884 --> 00:08:09,233
<b>And what else?</b>

106
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,023
<b>Well...</b>

107
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:17,992
<b>I was involved in a hit-and-run
accident that day.</b>

108
00:08:18,801 --> 00:08:20,094
<b>So I can't remember properly.</b>

109
00:08:21,336 --> 00:08:24,159
<b>- I mean it. Believe me.
- Hello, there.</b>

110
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:27,275
<b>I know you're inside. Hello?</b>

111
00:08:34,967 --> 00:08:36,372
<b>Don Hyuk,</b>

112
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:39,765
<b>I barely live on rent money.</b>

113
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:41,570
<b>You're making things difficult.</b>

114
00:08:44,461 --> 00:08:46,913
<b>I apologize. I'll get the money
in whatever way I can...</b>

115
00:08:46,937 --> 00:08:48,945
<b>- Look.
- Ma'am.</b>

116
00:08:54,514 --> 00:08:55,975
<b>Will this be enough?</b>

117
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,912
<b>This is enough. See you again.</b>

118
00:09:01,828 --> 00:09:02,828
<b>I...</b>

119
00:09:04,234 --> 00:09:05,885
<b>Why would you pay for that?</b>

120
00:09:07,601 --> 00:09:09,227
<b>If it weren't for you...</b>

121
00:09:09,664 --> 00:09:11,492
<b>Dae Yong would've taken it.</b>

122
00:09:12,382 --> 00:09:15,954
<b>Can you let me go in return?</b>

123
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,237
<b>Let me go now.</b>

124
00:09:19,273 --> 00:09:21,641
<b>I don't want to be involved in this.</b>

125
00:09:26,758 --> 00:09:27,927
<b>Chan Hong!</b>

126
00:09:32,265 --> 00:09:33,781
<b>That sentence you wrote was...</b>

127
00:09:37,805 --> 00:09:39,897
<b>the last sentence
Seo Jung sent to me.</b>

128
00:09:41,616 --> 00:09:43,125
<b>Before she died,</b>

129
00:09:45,413 --> 00:09:47,413
<b>weird pictures went around.
You know that, right?</b>

130
00:09:48,453 --> 00:09:51,249
<b>Yes, I heard recently.</b>

131
00:09:51,273 --> 00:09:52,891
<b>Someone took those pictures...</b>

132
00:09:54,703 --> 00:09:56,922
<b>and deliberately sent them to me.</b>

133
00:09:58,484 --> 00:10:00,875
<b>Oh, the girl who fell
off the rooftop and died?</b>

134
00:10:01,156 --> 00:10:03,230
<b>She was completely drunk.</b>

135
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:05,844
<b>Some guy was right next to her.</b>

136
00:10:06,882 --> 00:10:10,343
<b>Then I guess she was
actually sleeping around.</b>

137
00:10:10,367 --> 00:10:14,072
<b>- I know.
- So she was promiscuous.</b>

138
00:10:14,351 --> 00:10:18,116
<b>- I should've met her first.
- I knew she was so easy.</b>

139
00:10:19,609 --> 00:10:21,736
<b>Tell me, now.</b>

140
00:10:22,344 --> 00:10:23,515
<b>Did you really see it?</b>

141
00:10:24,047 --> 00:10:25,805
<b>Who was with Seo Jung?</b>

142
00:10:25,829 --> 00:10:26,829
<b>It's true!</b>

143
00:10:27,109 --> 00:10:29,508
<b>She was with a man with
a tattoo on his ankle.</b>

144
00:10:29,882 --> 00:10:31,078
<b>It was a card tattoo.</b>

145
00:10:31,453 --> 00:10:34,458
<b>A joker card.
He had a joker card tattoo.</b>

146
00:10:36,664 --> 00:10:38,819
<b>Seo Jung's phone wasn't
with her body...</b>

147
00:10:40,081 --> 00:10:42,221
<b>so I'm wondering if he was the one
who hid her phone.</b>

148
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,104
<b>And I think you were the last one
to see her phone.</b>

149
00:10:49,008 --> 00:10:50,422
<b>Let's make a deal.</b>

150
00:10:51,195 --> 00:10:52,688
<b>Sort of a contract.</b>

151
00:10:53,539 --> 00:10:54,633
<b>A contract?</b>

152
00:10:55,953 --> 00:10:58,684
<b>Don Hyuk asks for help in
a peculiar way.</b>

153
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:00,263
<b>I'm not asking you to help me
for nothing.</b>

154
00:11:00,287 --> 00:11:03,633
<b>Dae Yong won't give up on you,
or Sae Yun.</b>

155
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:06,227
