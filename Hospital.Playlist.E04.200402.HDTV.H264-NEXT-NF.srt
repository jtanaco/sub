<b>Your numbers look all normal.</b>

3
00:00:11,139 --> 00:00:13,100
<b>Just keep an eye on your weight.</b>

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:14,601
<b>But you know...</b>

5
00:00:14,685 --> 00:00:18,188
<b>Strangely, I catch a cold way more often</b>

6
00:00:18,271 --> 00:00:20,691
<b>-after getting the liver transplant.
-I see.</b>

7
00:00:20,774 --> 00:00:23,944
<b>I had one nasty winter last year
because of the cold.</b>

8
00:00:24,027 --> 00:00:27,572
<b>I see. I didn't know that.
Did you get the flu shot last year?</b>

9
00:00:27,656 --> 00:00:30,492
<b>No way. After getting the transplant,</b>

10
00:00:30,575 --> 00:00:32,411
<b>my heart starts beating fast</b>

11
00:00:32,494 --> 00:00:34,538
<b>whenever I see a syringe.</b>

12
00:00:34,621 --> 00:00:36,915
<b>Even so,
you should've gotten the flu shot.</b>

13
00:00:36,999 --> 00:00:37,958
<b>Even I get them.</b>

14
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:40,544
<b>We'll call you when your shot is due.
Get it this year.</b>

15
00:00:40,627 --> 00:00:41,503
<b>But you know,</b>

16
00:00:41,586 --> 00:00:44,881
<b>strangely, my skin gets dark spots easily</b>

17
00:00:44,965 --> 00:00:47,884
<b>after getting the liver transplant.</b>

18
00:00:48,135 --> 00:00:50,178
<b>Before the surgery,</b>

19
00:00:50,262 --> 00:00:54,057
<b>people used to tell me that I had
glowing skin like a man in his 60s.</b>

20
00:00:54,141 --> 00:00:56,184
<b>When you go out, do you apply sunscreen?</b>

21
00:00:56,268 --> 00:00:58,478
<b>My gosh, men don't need that.</b>

22
00:00:58,562 --> 00:01:00,647
<b>-I don't apply sunscreen.
-Goodness.</b>

23
00:01:00,897 --> 00:01:02,774
<b>That's why you're getting tanned.</b>

24
00:01:02,858 --> 00:01:05,235
<b>Besides, your skin was tanned,
to begin with.</b>

25
00:01:05,736 --> 00:01:08,697
<b>Is that so? But you know,</b>

26
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:12,743
<b>after getting the liver transplant,</b>

27
00:01:12,993 --> 00:01:16,288
<b>walking for just an hour would make
my legs hurt these days.</b>

28
00:01:16,997 --> 00:01:19,833
<b>When I'm a little bit tired,
I have pins and needles in my legs.</b>

29
00:01:19,916 --> 00:01:21,918
<b>And my back hurts, too.</b>

30
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:27,132
<b>Sir, how old are you this year?</b>

31
00:01:27,215 --> 00:01:28,050
<b>Me?</b>

32
00:01:29,051 --> 00:01:30,635
<b>I turned 84 this year.</b>

33
00:01:38,935 --> 00:01:41,480
<b>Come on. What can I do then?</b>

34
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,652
<b>Do you know Park Jong-jin,
an HCC patient who was admitted?</b>

35
00:01:47,736 --> 00:01:50,864
<b>When I told him his tumor got bigger,
he wanted to talk to you.</b>

36
00:01:50,947 --> 00:01:53,992
<b>I'll go check on my sister first,
then I'll talk to him before I go home.</b>

37
00:01:54,076 --> 00:01:55,494
<b>-Go get some rest.
-Okay.</b>

38
00:02:04,002 --> 00:02:05,337
<b>You should take the next one.</b>

39
00:02:06,505 --> 00:02:08,048
<b>-What?
-Just take the next one.</b>

<b><i>Third floor. Going up. Doors are closing.</i></b>

41
00:02:25,482 --> 00:02:26,525
<b>Hello.</b>

42
00:02:27,526 --> 00:02:28,485
<b>Hi.</b>

43
00:02:36,493 --> 00:02:37,536
<b>Gosh, this is good.</b>

44
00:02:38,328 --> 00:02:41,665
<b>NAME: LEE IK-SUN</b>

45
00:02:46,211 --> 00:02:47,254
<b>It's so good.</b>

46
00:02:51,299 --> 00:02:52,300
<b>Are you a wild beast?</b>

47
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:56,429
<b>You should cook that.
We've been using fire for centuries now.</b>

48
00:02:56,513 --> 00:02:59,307
<b>Everything is cooked except for this one.</b>

49
00:03:00,684 --> 00:03:02,936
<b>-Did Mom call you?
-Yes.</b>

50
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:05,939
<b>She might be onto something.
She called me yesterday and today.</b>

51
00:03:06,273 --> 00:03:08,441
<b>-You didn't tell her, did you?
-No, I didn't.</b>

52
00:03:08,525 --> 00:03:10,610
<b>If I do, I know she'll be worried.
Why would I do that?</b>

53
00:03:10,694 --> 00:03:12,779
<b>I guess Jun-wan is pretty good.</b>

54
00:03:12,863 --> 00:03:14,698
<b>I feel fine. My head just rings a bit.</b>

55
00:03:14,781 --> 00:03:15,991
<b>My gosh, the way you talk.</b>

56
00:03:16,074 --> 00:03:18,618
<b>You'll turn 40 soon.
Don't talk like a kid.</b>

57
00:03:19,911 --> 00:03:22,414
<b>It's been a while since I saw him.
And he's so old now.</b>

58
00:03:22,497 --> 00:03:24,207
<b>Of course. He'll turn 40 soon, too.</b>

59
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:26,710
<b>-Is he not going to get married?
-You should get married.</b>

60
00:03:28,253 --> 00:03:30,380
<b>-Did he come and check on you?
-Four times.</b>

61
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:34,050
<b>He came to check on me four times.
He's here all the time.</b>

62
00:03:34,134 --> 00:03:35,927
<b>He must think I'm still in middle school.</b>

63
00:03:37,387 --> 00:03:38,638
<b>Gosh, that's gross.</b>

64
00:03:40,765 --> 00:03:41,975
<b>Nice. That makes it five.</b>

65
00:03:45,729 --> 00:03:48,315
<b>Say hello, Professor Kim. He's my brother.</b>

66
00:03:48,982 --> 00:03:50,567
<b>Please take good care of her.</b>

67
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:53,778
<b>I'm Lee Ik-jun,
Major Lee Ik-sun's older brother.</b>

68
00:03:53,862 --> 00:03:57,282
<b>I truly appreciate the work
you did on her.</b>

69
00:03:57,365 --> 00:03:59,075
<b>Just like she told me,</b>

70
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:01,411
<b>you're just getting old
as a lonely bachelor.</b>

71
00:04:01,494 --> 00:04:04,873
<b>-My gosh, yes. I am. My apologies.
-Okay.</b>

72
00:04:04,956 --> 00:04:06,958
<b>Seeing how you're goofing around,
you can go home.</b>

73
00:04:07,042 --> 00:04:09,794
<b>I got the medical certificate
and admission note ready for you.</b>

74
00:04:09,878 --> 00:04:11,922
<b>-You can get discharged tomorrow.
-Okay.</b>

75
00:04:14,132 --> 00:04:15,800
<b>You're not going back right away, right?</b>

76
00:04:16,509 --> 00:04:18,678
<b>She's off for two weeks.
She'll rest up at my house.</b>

77
00:04:18,762 --> 00:04:20,639
<b>You're not going to Changwon?
Stay with your mom.</b>

78
00:04:20,722 --> 00:04:23,308
<b>Gosh, no. She doesn't know yet.
Hand me some tissues.</b>

79
00:04:25,435 --> 00:04:28,939
<b>You know what? Your hospital
must be environmentally friendly.</b>

80
00:04:29,064 --> 00:04:29,981
<b>There are birds here.</b>

81
00:04:30,565 --> 00:04:32,400
<b>Birds? Are there birds inside?</b>

82
00:04:32,484 --> 00:04:34,402
<b>-My gosh.
-Right here.</b>

83
00:04:38,615 --> 00:04:40,075
<b>What should I do?</b>

84
00:04:45,997 --> 00:04:47,874
<b>Being her brother is so hard.
It really is.</b>

85
00:04:49,167 --> 00:04:50,085
<b>Stay still.</b>

86
00:04:56,049 --> 00:04:57,342
<b>What was that?</b>

87
00:04:57,425 --> 00:04:59,511
<b>It's <i>buljajangmyeon</i>. It's so good.</b>

88
00:04:59,594 --> 00:05:01,221
<b>-Is it spicy?
-Yes, it is a little.</b>

89
00:05:01,304 --> 00:05:03,014
<b>But it's the best <i>jajangmyeon</i> I had.</b>

90
00:05:03,098 --> 00:05:04,849
<b>I had <i>jajangmyeon</i>
from every restaurant near my base.</b>

91
00:05:04,933 --> 00:05:08,144
<b>But this restaurant has
the best <i>jajangmyeon.</i> It's so good.</b>

92
00:05:08,561 --> 00:05:09,813
<b>You must come and try it.</b>

93
00:05:09,896 --> 00:05:13,275
<b>No matter how good it is, I won't go
all the way there just for <i>jajangmyeon</i>.</b>

94
00:05:13,358 --> 00:05:15,902
<b>How can you never come to see
your own sister in Inje?</b>

95
00:05:16,778 --> 00:05:18,321
<b>I visited you when you were in Cheorwon.</b>

96
00:05:18,405 --> 00:05:19,990
<b>That was three years ago!</b>

97
00:05:20,073 --> 00:05:21,408
<b>I'm busy trying to meet ends meet.</b>

98
00:05:21,491 --> 00:05:22,690
<b>I look after my son and my patients.</b>

99
00:05:22,784 --> 00:05:25,745
<b>I'm busy, too.
I have 300 soldiers under me.</b>

100
00:05:25,829 --> 00:05:27,455
<b>Don't you feel sorry for your only sister?</b>

101
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:29,582
<b>I'm stuck in Inje,
only eating <i>buljajangmyeon</i>.</b>

102
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:33,420
<b>What are you talking about?
Field grade officers get many days off.</b>

103
00:05:33,503 --> 00:05:36,423
<b>You're a major in the army,
but all you do is travel.</b>

104
00:05:36,506 --> 00:05:38,091
<b>I didn't get to travel that much.</b>

105
00:05:38,174 --> 00:05:39,634
<b>I can't go beyond the border anyway.</b>

106
00:05:39,718 --> 00:05:41,803
<b>No matter what, I'm stuck in Inje.</b>

107
00:05:41,886 --> 00:05:43,179
<b>I ate all the downstream trouts
and salmons.</b>

108
00:05:43,263 --> 00:05:45,849
<b>You always liked sashimi anyway.
You're a sashimi lover.</b>

109
00:05:45,932 --> 00:05:48,810
<b>You eat them because you like sashimi.
Why are you blaming it on the fish?</b>

110
00:05:48,893 --> 00:05:50,270
<b>You said <i>buljajangmyeon</i> was great.</b>

111
00:05:50,353 --> 00:05:51,938
<b>If you can eat that
delicious thing every day,</b>

112
00:05:52,022 --> 00:05:54,107
<b>you'd be happy every day.
Why would I feel bad for you?</b>

113
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:56,443
<b>Oh, my. Are you guys rapping?</b>

114
00:05:56,526 --> 00:05:58,611
<b>You two should become rappers.</b>

115
00:05:58,695 --> 00:05:59,529
<b>Actually, we used to</b>

116
00:05:59,612 --> 00:06:00,822
<b>practice rapping together.</b>

117
00:06:00,905 --> 00:06:03,908
<b>When I was in middle school,
and he was in high school,</b>

118
00:06:04,034 --> 00:06:05,702
<b>We entered a comedy contest
as two rappers. But we didn't make it.</b>

119
00:06:06,453 --> 00:06:08,747
<b>-Comedy contest?
-That was a long time ago.</b>

120
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,958
<b>By the way, who did you want
to see from the hospital?</b>

121
00:06:12,042 --> 00:06:14,836
<b>-Didn't she come to see you?
-No way. You think she'd come to see me?</b>

122
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,213
<b>I'm sure she came here to see her friend.</b>

123
00:06:17,589 --> 00:06:20,800
<b>I was going to see you and my friend, too.</b>

124
00:06:20,884 --> 00:06:24,012
<b>It's my best friend. And my best friend
has to work on the weekends, too.</b>

125
00:06:24,346 --> 00:06:26,306
<b>So I came here to surprise my friend.</b>

126
00:06:27,307 --> 00:06:28,433
<b>Darn it.</b>

127
00:06:31,436 --> 00:06:33,229
<b>-Wait, is it a guy?
-Yes.</b>

128
00:06:33,313 --> 00:06:35,148
<b>-Is he your boyfriend?
-No, he's not.</b>

129
00:06:35,231 --> 00:06:36,983
<b>He's the closest friend in the army.</b>

130
00:06:37,859 --> 00:06:40,111
<b>-I don't think so.
-We're really just friends.</b>

131
00:06:40,695 --> 00:06:42,447
<b>We're like you and Song-hwa.</b>

132
00:06:42,947 --> 00:06:43,948
<b>Salute.</b>

133
00:06:47,369 --> 00:06:49,829
<b>My gosh, Major Lee. How long has it been?</b>

134
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:52,248
<b>Are you okay now?
Sorry I couldn't come yesterday.</b>

135
00:06:52,749 --> 00:06:55,168
<b>Mr. Civilian. You look great.</b>

136
00:06:56,252 --> 00:06:59,589
<b>-Oh, my. Hello.
-What is this?</b>

137
00:07:00,715 --> 00:07:03,426
<b>It's Dr. Ahn Chi-hong from NS?
Are you two friends?</b>

138
00:07:04,302 --> 00:07:06,429
<b>Right. You said you graduated
from the Military Academy.</b>

139
00:07:06,513 --> 00:07:08,264
<b>Why didn't I connect the dots?</b>

140
00:07:08,348 --> 00:07:09,766
<b>It didn't occur to me, either.</b>

141
00:07:09,849 --> 00:07:12,060
<b>Now that I know,
your names are very similar.</b>

142
00:07:12,352 --> 00:07:13,686
<b>-Do you know each other?
-Yes.</b>

143
00:07:14,187 --> 00:07:16,773
<b>Hey, by the way, I approve.
I approve of this.</b>

144
00:07:17,357 --> 00:07:19,317
<b>-Of what?
-I like Dr. Ahn.</b>

145
00:07:19,401 --> 00:07:22,153
<b>Gosh. I got nothing to say if it's him.</b>

146
00:07:22,237 --> 00:07:24,072
<b>-I approve.
-Come on.</b>

147
00:07:24,572 --> 00:07:25,990
<b>Hey, stop that nonsense.</b>

-Just go.</b>

150
00:07:30,703 --> 00:07:31,830
<b>Bye.</b>

151

<b>Wait. Please take good care of my sister.</b>

152

<b>She may come across as rough,</b>

<b>HOSPITAL PLAYLIST</b>

00:08:01,234 --> 00:08:04,362
<b>A cup of large iced latte, please.</b>

158
00:08:04,612 --> 00:08:06,030
<b>What do you want?</b>

159
00:08:06,114 --> 00:08:09,117
<b>I'll have some tomato juice. Thank you.</b>

160
00:08:09,868 --> 00:08:11,953
<b>-Who is he?
-A surgical intern.</b>

161
00:08:12,036 --> 00:08:13,204
<b>I see. Hello.</b>

162
00:08:13,496 --> 00:08:15,290
<b>One tomato juice, too.</b>

163
00:08:15,457 --> 00:08:19,085
<b>Say hello. She's a second-year
ob-gyn resident. Dr. Chu Min-ha.</b>

164
00:08:19,419 --> 00:08:21,546
<b>-Hello.
-Is he the only intern?</b>

165
00:08:21,629 --> 00:08:23,214
<b>Are you the only surgical intern?</b>

166
00:08:23,298 --> 00:08:25,341
<b>There is another one,
but there's a liver metastasis conference</b>

167
00:08:25,425 --> 00:08:26,509
<b>for a breast cancer patient.</b>

168
00:08:26,593 --> 00:08:28,261
<b>So the other intern went
to the conference.</b>

169
00:08:28,887 --> 00:08:31,931
<b>-I thought you had a lunch date.
-Gosh, it wasn't a date at all.</b>

170
00:08:32,515 --> 00:08:34,934
<b>He wanted me to buy him lunch,
so I just bought him a meal.</b>

171
00:08:35,018 --> 00:08:36,811
<b>-I'll pay.
-He's eight years younger than her.</b>

172
00:08:36,895 --> 00:08:38,897
<b>-She's got games.
-Seven years.</b>

173
00:08:39,939 --> 00:08:41,774
<b>-Do you want to chat for a bit?
-I have to go.</b>

174
00:08:41,858 --> 00:08:42,692
<b>Gosh.</b>

175
00:08:42,775 --> 00:08:45,528
<b>-Buy me a cup of coffee, too.
-What would you like to have?</b>

176
00:08:46,404 --> 00:08:48,198
<b>I'd like an Iced latte with a lot of ice.</b>

177

<b>One more iced latte, please.</b>

178
00:08:50,033 --> 00:08:51,493
<b>You two are like besties.</b>

179
00:08:51,951 --> 00:08:54,162
<b>I've been bothering him these days.</b>

180
00:08:54,245 --> 00:08:57,332
<b>I really can't figure out what kind of
person Professor Yang Seok-hyeong is.</b>

181
00:08:57,415 --> 00:08:59,000
<b>I'm getting a crash course from him.</b>

182
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:01,294
<b>When it comes to those five members
of the comedy club,</b>

183
00:09:01,377 --> 00:09:04,297
<b>I can describe them in an omniscient
viewpoint as their colleague.</b>

184
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,383
<b>Everything. Their dating history,
families, and what they are really like.</b>

185
00:09:08,218 --> 00:09:09,594
<b>It only takes a cup of coffee.</b>

186
00:09:11,095 --> 00:09:12,347
<b>Yours are ready. You should go.</b>

187
00:09:28,821 --> 00:09:30,990
<b>Hello, when did this happen?</b>

188
00:09:31,616 --> 00:09:34,786
<b>It's been an hour.
He passed out in the shower.</b>

189
00:09:37,705 --> 00:09:39,249
<b>Can you move this leg for me?</b>

190
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,793
<b>All right. And this leg.</b>

191
00:09:46,548 --> 00:09:48,341
<b>He's not a Korean national, right?</b>

192
00:09:48,967 --> 00:09:49,801
<b>Right.</b>

193
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:59,477
<b>Right now, he's suffering
from an intracerebral hemorrhage.</b>

194
00:09:59,978 --> 00:10:01,479
<b>If his blood pressure remains high,</b>

195
00:10:01,563 --> 00:10:03,356
<b>the bleeding could get worse
and may lead to death.</b>

196
00:10:05,567 --> 00:10:08,027
<b>I managed to get him a bed in the ICU,
so he should stay there</b>

197
00:10:08,111 --> 00:10:10,196
<b>and get surgery this afternoon or tonight.</b>

198
00:10:12,532 --> 00:10:13,741
<b>Please sign here.</b>

199
00:10:19,789 --> 00:10:22,041
<b>She said she's suddenly discharging blood.</b>

200
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:23,668
<b>How long has it been?</b>

201
00:10:25,086 --> 00:10:26,254
<b>It's been two to three days.</b>

202
00:10:27,547 --> 00:10:30,800
<b>Is there a lot of blood or does it hurt
like during your menstrual cycle?</b>

203
00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:34,012
<b>Not really. I don't think so.</b>

204
00:10:35,054 --> 00:10:37,223
<b>Just tell the doctor everything.</b>

205
00:10:37,557 --> 00:10:39,726
<b>She can be really shy, you know.</b>

206
00:10:40,018 --> 00:10:42,103
<b>People say that
kids these days are out of control,</b>

207
00:10:42,729 --> 00:10:44,564
<b>but she's so innocent. Goodness.</b>

208
00:10:44,647 --> 00:10:46,691
<b>Then, let me take a look at
her ultrasound.</b>

209
00:10:47,191 --> 00:10:48,735
<b>-Let's do an ultrasound.
-Okay.</b>

210
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:51,946
<b>Ma'am, you can stay outside.
After the scan, we will bring you back in.</b>

211
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:55,700
<b>-Okay. Just do it. You'll be okay.
-Mom.</b>

212
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:06,586
<b>Doctor, do you think
this is implantation bleeding?</b>

213
00:11:09,464 --> 00:11:12,091
<b>Has it been two weeks
since I did it with my boyfriend?</b>

214
00:11:13,384 --> 00:11:15,678
<b>Damn it. I'm totally fucked.</b>

215
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:19,307
<b>Do you think I am pregnant?</b>

216
00:11:19,807 --> 00:11:21,726
<b>If I am, my mom will kill me.</b>

217
00:11:22,894 --> 00:11:25,563
<b>That motherfucker.
I told him to put on a condom.</b>

218
00:11:25,647 --> 00:11:27,148
<b>Damn it.</b>

219
00:11:29,942 --> 00:11:31,903
<b>Well, we don't know that yet.</b>

220
00:11:31,986 --> 00:11:34,489
<b>Not all vaginal bleeding means
implantation in the uterus.</b>

221
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:36,991
<b>I see...</b>

222
00:11:38,493 --> 00:11:39,577
<b>Then,</b>

223
00:11:40,662 --> 00:11:42,747
<b>does it mean I can still have sex?</b>

224
00:11:49,962 --> 00:11:51,631
<b>You're an intern. So how old you are you?</b>

225
00:11:51,714 --> 00:11:52,965
<b>I'm 26 years old.</b>

226
00:11:53,549 --> 00:11:54,509
<b>-My gosh.
-My goodness.</b>

227

<b>He's a baby.</b>

<b>-I'm so jealous.
-Goodness.</b>

<b>-Sit down.
-Hi.</b>

232

<b>My gosh, I'm hungry.

233
00:12:06,146 --> 00:12:09,399
<b>-Here. This is yours, sir.
-Okay.</b>

234
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:10,900
<b>Goodness.</b>

235
00:12:11,109 --> 00:12:13,778
<b>I'm sorry.
I just finished seeing my outpatients.</b>

236
00:12:13,861 --> 00:12:15,321
<b>My apologies.</b>

237
00:12:17,907 --> 00:12:19,158
<b>You must be Im Chang-min.</b>

238

<b>Age, 26. Hometown, Cheongju.
You met your girlfriend from school.</b>

239
00:12:23,913 --> 00:12:26,082
<b>You like to drink Tesla, right?</b>

240
00:12:27,709 --> 00:12:30,211
<b>Do you know what that is?
Not the auto company.</b>

241
00:12:30,336 --> 00:12:32,672
<b>It's a cocktail thing.
I haven't eaten yet. I'm starving.</b>

242
00:12:32,755 --> 00:12:33,589
<b>Seriously?</b>

243
00:12:35,299 --> 00:12:37,927
<b>We have to pay for food like this?</b>

244
00:12:39,929 --> 00:12:42,432
<b>My goodness, what a rip-off.
Don't you think?</b>

245
00:12:47,061 --> 00:12:49,439
<b>-Pardon?
-He wants to be discharged.</b>

246
00:12:49,522 --> 00:12:51,190
<b>If he does, he might die.</b>

247
00:12:51,274 --> 00:12:52,859
<b>He can't afford it.</b>

248
00:12:52,942 --> 00:12:54,527
<b>We have the Social Services Department.</b>

249
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:56,696
<b>They can get some help
even if they are foreigners.</b>

250
00:12:56,904 --> 00:12:59,574
<b>Actually, I looked into that.
This patient doesn't have a passport.</b>

251
00:12:59,657 --> 00:13:01,909
<b>And he can't get
an income certificate, either.</b>

252
00:13:01,993 --> 00:13:03,536
<b>Our hospital cannot help him.</b>

253
00:13:06,122 --> 00:13:07,790
<b>-What should I do?
-Hold on.</b>

254

<b><i>Let me characterize those five doctors

<b>To sum it up,</b>

256
00:13:14,672 --> 00:13:15,715
<b>they should be called Lacking Five.</b>

257

<b>I could call them that.</b>

258
00:13:19,385 --> 00:13:20,470
<b>I thought you had to go.</b>

259
00:13:21,596 --> 00:13:22,847
<b>What does that mean?</b>

260
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:24,432
<b>So everyone lacks something?</b>

261
00:13:24,515 --> 00:13:27,185
<b>That's right. Everyone lacks something.</b>

262
00:13:27,268 --> 00:13:28,436
<b>Let's start with Song-hwa.</b>

263
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:30,062
<b>-The only female.
-The only female</b>

<b>and their emotional pillar.</b>

265
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:35,985
<b>In a nutshell,
she doesn't have any weaknesses.</b>

266
00:13:36,569 --> 00:13:38,863
<b>She's good at her job.</b>

267
00:13:38,946 --> 00:13:40,740
<b>And she helps other people, too.</b>

268
00:13:40,823 --> 00:13:42,992
<b>When I have some extra time,
I'll write her biography.</b>

269
00:13:43,075 --> 00:13:45,536
<b>-I heard about her.
-She's better than what you've heard.</b>

270
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:49,749
<b>Song-hwa is a perfect nerd.
But she likes having fun, too.</b>

271

<b>She likes having meals with colleagues
and can drink, too.</b>

272

<b>And sometimes, she acts all crazy.</b>

273
00:13:56,088 --> 00:13:58,466
<b>She's pure-hearted.</b>

274
00:13:59,717 --> 00:14:01,177
<b>Is that possible at her age?</b>

275
00:14:02,428 --> 00:14:03,930
<b>What's wrong with our age?</b>

276
00:14:06,349 --> 00:14:08,768
<b>The Social Services Department said
they would look into it.</b>

277
00:14:08,893 --> 00:14:10,228
<b>-But it may take some time.
-Right.</b>

278
00:14:10,561 --> 00:14:12,772
<b>But I don't think
this patient should be discharged.</b>

<b>-I don't know what to do.

00:14:57,108 --> 00:14:59,402
<b>-Where is he from?
-He's from Indonesia.</b>

298
00:14:59,485 --> 00:15:01,821
<b>-Professor, I can talk to her...
-He's from Indonesia.</b>

299
00:15:02,321 --> 00:15:04,490
<b>No, we don't have much time.
I'll leave my number.</b>

300
00:15:04,574 --> 00:15:06,993
<b>If you have any questions, call me.</b>

301
00:15:07,076 --> 00:15:10,454
<b>By the way, do you think you can get
Grandpa-Long-Legs on the phone?</b>

302
00:15:10,538 --> 00:15:11,914
<b>We really don't have time.</b>

303
00:15:12,498 --> 00:15:15,251
<b>The patient is in critical condition.</b>

304
00:15:16,085 --> 00:15:18,754
<b>Please get back to me
as soon as possible. Okay.</b>

305
00:15:20,172 --> 00:15:22,884
<b>Usually, the sponsor gets back
to them right away. Let's wait.</b>

306
00:15:23,801 --> 00:15:26,554
<b>All right, then.
We took care of the medical bills.</b>

307
00:15:26,637 --> 00:15:27,471
<b>Where is he now?</b>

308
00:15:28,264 --> 00:15:29,307
<b>He's still in the ER.</b>

309
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:31,767
<b>Go ahead with the CT navigation
and prep for surgery.</b>

310
00:15:31,851 --> 00:15:33,853
<b>I'll call the Anesthesiology
to book an OR.</b>

311
00:15:33,936 --> 00:15:35,396
<b>I'm calling them now. I'll do it.</b>

312
00:15:35,479 --> 00:15:36,981
<b>You go and prep for surgery now.</b>

313
00:15:37,064 --> 00:15:39,275
<b>Hey, it's me.
I'll send a patient up for premedication.</b>

314
00:15:39,358 --> 00:15:40,860
<b>Get me an OR.</b>

315
00:15:41,861 --> 00:15:43,821
<b>All right. Next up is Kim Jun-wan.</b>

316
00:15:44,071 --> 00:15:47,533
<b>Jun-wan is the best surgeon.</b>

317
00:15:47,658 --> 00:15:49,327
<b>But he is...</b>

318
00:15:50,369 --> 00:15:51,996
<b>He's a jerk.</b>

319
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:58,669
<b>-How's the ultrasound?
-Yes, it's fully blocked.</b>

320
00:15:59,211 --> 00:16:01,213
<b>-It's not bleeding, right?
-Yes. It's fine.</b>

321
00:16:01,297 --> 00:16:02,590
<b>Jae-hak.</b>

322
00:16:03,215 --> 00:16:05,301
<b>Why should we be careful with the AV node?</b>

323
00:16:07,303 --> 00:16:09,180
<b>Why should we be careful with that?</b>

324
00:16:13,809 --> 00:16:14,936
<b>Hey!</b>

325
00:16:17,521 --> 00:16:19,315
<b>Is my surgery that boring?</b>

326
00:16:20,441 --> 00:16:21,609
<b>A bit.</b>

327
00:16:22,151 --> 00:16:24,904
<b>No. Not at all. It's fun!</b>

328
00:16:26,155 --> 00:16:27,573
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

329
00:16:29,075 --> 00:16:31,827
<b>How could you doze off when
the patient is between life and death?</b>

330
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:38,417
<b>Well, I'm also on the verge of...</b>

331
00:16:47,301 --> 00:16:48,594
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

332
00:16:49,595 --> 00:16:52,598
<b>Professor Kim, there's no bleeding.
The surgery went well.</b>

333
00:16:52,932 --> 00:16:54,767
<b>-We'll wrap up the rest.
-Will you?</b>

334
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:56,852
<b>Yes. Great surgery, sir.</b>

335
00:16:59,313 --> 00:17:00,773
<b>Good job.</b>

336
00:17:01,273 --> 00:17:03,776
<b>-Great surgery.
-Great surgery, sir.</b>

337
00:17:05,444 --> 00:17:07,780
<b>Don't we have footage of TOF surgery?</b>

338
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:09,073
<b>Yes, sir.</b>

339
00:17:09,156 --> 00:17:11,117
<b>Give him that,
so he can reflect on himself.</b>

340
00:17:16,706 --> 00:17:20,126
<b>Dr. Jang, you're drooling right now.</b>

341
00:17:20,918 --> 00:17:23,713
<b>Dr. Chu, aren't your cheeks too red?</b>

342
00:17:24,755 --> 00:17:25,965
<b>-Is it too much?
-Yes.</b>

343
00:17:26,757 --> 00:17:29,844
<b>I applied it because I wanted
to look three or four years younger.</b>

344
00:17:29,927 --> 00:17:31,929
<b>You look 34 years younger.</b>

345

<b>Lee Ik-jun, that prick...</b>

368
00:18:46,003 --> 00:18:48,714
<b>He was at the top of his class

369
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:50,174
<b>and graduated at the top, too.</b>

370
00:18:50,257 --> 00:18:51,425
<b>-Really?
-Yes.</b>

371
00:18:51,509 --> 00:18:53,677
<b>Ik-jun had the highest mark
on the medical board exam.</b>

372
00:18:53,761 --> 00:18:55,054
<b>Shouldn't he be the biggest clown instead?</b>

373
00:18:55,638 --> 00:18:56,764
<b>That's what I heard too.</b>

374
00:18:56,847 --> 00:18:59,141
<b>When he was a med student,
he practically lived at clubs.</b>

375
00:18:59,225 --> 00:19:00,434
<b>But he still got the top.</b>

376
00:19:00,935 --> 00:19:03,854
<b>I'm not sure if he's just that smart
or he studied in secret.</b>

377
00:19:03,938 --> 00:19:05,689
<b>Anyway, a practicum or exam.</b>

378
00:19:05,773 --> 00:19:07,733
<b>It didn't matter.
He always got the highest grades.</b>

379
00:19:07,817 --> 00:19:10,152
<b>But do you know
what this punk doesn't have?</b>

380
00:19:10,236 --> 00:19:13,239
<b>-Modesty?
-Sure. he's not modest, either.</b>

381
00:19:13,322 --> 00:19:15,658
<b>Perhaps, it's because he got it all.</b>

382
00:19:15,741 --> 00:19:18,994
<b>But he doesn't have any
inferiority complex or prejudice.</b>

383
00:19:19,787 --> 00:19:21,789
<b>-He's not twisted at heart.
-Right.</b>

384
00:19:21,872 --> 00:19:24,333
<b>Do they expect anyone to pay
for a thing like this?</b>

385
00:19:26,001 --> 00:19:28,546
<b>This is such a rip-off. My goodness.</b>

386
00:19:29,046 --> 00:19:30,047
<b>Sir.</b>

387
00:19:31,006 --> 00:19:35,177
<b>You always eat meals prepared by others,
but you always seem to complain.</b>

388
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:37,721
<b>You should just eat it.
It's actually good.</b>

389
00:19:37,805 --> 00:19:38,889
<b>Okay?</b>

390
00:19:39,765 --> 00:19:42,935
<b>Starting now, whenever you complain,
you'll have to pay 10,000 won.</b>

391
00:19:43,978 --> 00:19:45,354
<b>You have to. Okay?</b>

392
00:19:45,437 --> 00:19:47,523
<b>Hey, why would I pay 10,000 won?</b>

393
00:19:47,606 --> 00:19:50,484
<b>That's too expensive.
This meal probably costs less than that.</b>

00:19:50,985 --> 00:19:53,654
<b>My gosh. Fine. All right.</b>

395
00:19:54,613 --> 00:19:56,907

<b>-Enjoy your meal.
-My gosh.</b>

397
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:02,121
<b>-So Ahn Jeong-won is the last one.
-Yes.</b>

398
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,248
<b>Jeong-won doesn't have...</b>

399
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:07,751
<b>-any desire for material possessions.
-Obviously.</b>

00:21:52,356 --> 00:21:54,483
<b>Okay, I heard you.</b>

442

<b>SEXUAL PREDATOR CONGRESSMAN SIM YEONG-SU
GETS A LIVER TRANSPLANT</b>

443
00:22:07,037 --> 00:22:08,497
<b>HE WAS ADMITTED TO YULJE MEDICAL CENTER</b>

444
00:22:12,084 --> 00:22:15,629
<b>HE WAS FINED FOR ASSAULTING A CADDIE
AT A GOLF COURSE LAST MONTH</b>

445
00:22:17,589 --> 00:22:20,301
<b>MOM</b>

446
00:22:21,468 --> 00:22:22,678
<b>Hi, Mom.</b>

447
00:22:23,971 --> 00:22:25,848
<b>Yes. Did you have your lunch?</b>

448
00:22:26,807 --> 00:22:27,933
<b>What did you eat?</b>

449
00:22:29,476 --> 00:22:32,187
<b>Mom, I got paid today.
What should I do with this?</b>

450
00:22:33,105 --> 00:22:34,523
<b>What do I do? Tell me.</b>

451
00:22:36,358 --> 00:22:41,989
<b>By the way, did Professor Ahn Jeong-won
date anyone when he was a med student?</b>

452
00:22:42,072 --> 00:22:42,990
<b>Jeong-won?</b>

453
00:22:43,532 --> 00:22:44,867
<b>Well...</b>

454
00:22:47,202 --> 00:22:50,080
<b>By the way,
you guys seem to have a lot of time.</b>

455
00:22:51,165 --> 00:22:52,416
<b>When I was your age...</b>

456
00:22:58,922 --> 00:23:01,133
<b>Did you study
about the patient's condition?</b>

457
00:23:01,425 --> 00:23:04,303
<b>Yes. It's called gastroschi...</b>

458
00:23:04,386 --> 00:23:07,389
<b>It's a gastroschisis.
It means a lack of an abdominal wall.</b>

459
00:23:07,473 --> 00:23:08,557
<b>Can you elaborate?</b>

460
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,893
<b>When a baby has its abdominal wall
undeveloped,</b>

461
00:23:10,976 --> 00:23:12,936
<b>its intestines come out of the body.</b>

462
00:23:13,187 --> 00:23:15,481
<b>When did the patient get diagnosed
with the condition?</b>

463
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:19,485
<b>The mother was diagnosed with
gastroschisis 20 weeks into her pregnancy.</b>

464
00:23:19,568 --> 00:23:21,362
<b>And she's 36 weeks into her pregnancy now.</b>

465
00:23:21,445 --> 00:23:22,821
<b>You seem to know better than me.</b>

466
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,824
<b>Does it mean the baby is likely to die?</b>

467
00:23:25,949 --> 00:23:28,952
<b>No. This is a rare condition,
but we get a few patients like her.</b>

468
00:23:29,036 --> 00:23:30,954
<b>And usually, the babies have surgery
as soon as they are born.</b>

469
00:23:31,038 --> 00:23:32,122
<b>They can be healthy again.</b>

470
00:23:33,207 --> 00:23:34,917
<b>Because they must get the surgery
right after they are born,</b>

471
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,336
<b>it's better to consult
a pediatric surgeon in advance.</b>

472
00:23:37,419 --> 00:23:40,798
<b>So there will be a meeting
with the surgical professor today.</b>

473
00:23:41,215 --> 00:23:42,633
<b>Is it okay for us to join?</b>

474
00:23:42,716 --> 00:23:45,386
<b>Those meetings in dramas
seem really serious.</b>

475
00:23:48,222 --> 00:23:51,558
<b>Why not? Can't you just do the surgery?
Let's go with the C-section. Please?</b>

476
00:23:51,642 --> 00:23:53,477
<b>It's not something you can decide.</b>

477
00:23:54,269 --> 00:23:55,813
<b>That's what the mother wants.</b>

478
00:24:02,861 --> 00:24:03,737
<b>Tell him.</b>

479
00:24:04,863 --> 00:24:07,032
<b>I examined the mother.
Her pelvis is in good shape.</b>

480
00:24:07,116 --> 00:24:09,701
<b>And the baby's head
is at around the pelvis, too.</b>

481
00:24:09,785 --> 00:24:11,620
<b>So we think
the vaginal delivery will be easier.</b>

482
00:24:12,413 --> 00:24:14,248
<b>It means she'll give birth naturally.</b>

483
00:24:15,416 --> 00:24:16,625
<b>I'm glad to hear that.</b>

484
00:24:17,126 --> 00:24:18,919
<b>The baby isn't that small, right?</b>

485
00:24:19,002 --> 00:24:21,296
<b>No. The baby isn't too small.</b>

486
00:24:22,089 --> 00:24:25,008
<b>Actually, in cases like this,
some people are concerned</b>

487
00:24:25,092 --> 00:24:28,387
<b>that a vaginal delivery might increase
the chance of infections in babies.</b>

488
00:24:28,929 --> 00:24:33,517
<b>But I can't guarantee that a C-section
will lower that chance, either.</b>

489
00:24:33,976 --> 00:24:38,147
<b>More than anything, the mother strongly
wants to have the vaginal delivery.</b>

490
00:24:38,772 --> 00:24:40,149
<b>Okay.</b>

491
00:24:41,525 --> 00:24:44,945
<b>But we don't know
when the baby will come out.</b>

492
00:24:45,028 --> 00:24:47,531
<b>What if I'm in the middle of surgery
when the baby comes out?</b>

493
00:24:47,614 --> 00:24:48,657
<b>You're right.</b>

494
00:24:48,824 --> 00:24:53,871
<b>That's why I'll observe her until Week 38
and try inducing labor.</b>

495
00:24:55,664 --> 00:24:58,417
<b>You punk. Why didn't you say so?</b>

496
00:25:00,294 --> 00:25:01,295
<b>Don't laugh.</b>

497
00:25:01,378 --> 00:25:04,214
<b>Hey, think about it. The mother
would also want her pediatric surgeon</b>

498
00:25:04,298 --> 00:25:06,633
<b>to do the surgery on her baby.</b>

499
00:25:06,717 --> 00:25:09,261
<b>She agreed to the inducing labor
over a C-section.</b>

500
00:25:09,845 --> 00:25:13,307
<b>With labor induction, we can usually
deliver the baby on the day we want.</b>

501
00:25:14,683 --> 00:25:17,769
<b>I'm glad to hear that. Then, pick a day
when I don't have outpatients.</b>

502
00:25:17,853 --> 00:25:18,979
<b>Sure.</b>

503
00:25:19,062 --> 00:25:22,191
<b>It's been 36 weeks and 2 days as of today.</b>

504
00:25:22,274 --> 00:25:24,359
<b>I'll make it two weeks from today.</b>

505
00:25:25,694 --> 00:25:27,446
<b>So should we wrap up the meeting?</b>

506
00:25:28,113 --> 00:25:28,947
<b>Yes.</b>

507
00:25:29,948 --> 00:25:31,366
<b>Hey, what are you doing tonight?</b>

508
00:25:32,034 --> 00:25:34,119
<b>I don't have any plans.
Do you want to get drinks?</b>

509
00:25:34,203 --> 00:25:35,412
<b>Sure.</b>

510
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:39,208
<b>What about other guys?
What's Ik-jun up to?</b>

511
00:25:39,291 --> 00:25:42,544
<b>Congressman Sim was admitted today,
so he'll have to stay with the patient.</b>

512
00:25:47,799 --> 00:25:49,718
<b>Is his son the donor?</b>

513
00:25:50,469 --> 00:25:51,303
<b>Yes.</b>

514
00:25:54,389 --> 00:25:55,807
<b>I bet he's putting on a show.</b>

515
00:26:07,528 --> 00:26:10,322
<b><i>Let's eat first. The meal boxes
just arrived. They are warm.</i></b>

516
00:26:10,405 --> 00:26:11,240
<b><i>-Okay.
-Okay.</i></b>

517
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,744
<b>Here.</b>

518
00:26:16,954 --> 00:26:19,289
<b>All the beds are full today.
Eat when you can.</b>

519
00:26:19,373 --> 00:26:20,457
<b>Thank you.</b>

<b>Jo Je-yeong in Room 6103.</b>

521
00:26:23,252 --> 00:26:25,212
<b>He had a TACE in 2016.</b>

522
00:26:25,295 --> 00:26:27,005
<b>Yes, but there were some lesions left.</b>

523
00:26:27,089 --> 00:26:29,258
<b>So he got the RFA and TACE.</b>

524
00:26:29,341 --> 00:26:30,467
<b>What's TACE?</b>

525
00:26:30,551 --> 00:26:33,220
<b>Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization.</b>

526

<b>I keep pressing the remote,

<b>Hold on. Let me go with you.</b>

542
00:27:27,232 --> 00:27:28,275
<b>Where did he go?</b>

<b>He's in Room Two,

548
00:27:50,422 --> 00:27:52,382
<b>-Why not?
-He's quite sensitive.</b>

549
00:27:52,466 --> 00:27:54,593
<b>Only a designated nurse can see him.</b>

550
00:27:54,676 --> 00:27:57,346
<b>Even Professor Gwon Sun-jeong
got to see him only once.</b>

551
00:27:57,804 --> 00:27:59,848
<b>Since he's the donor,
he doesn't have to do a lot.</b>

552
00:27:59,931 --> 00:28:01,391
<b>But he's very cranky.</b>

553
00:28:01,475 --> 00:28:02,392
<b>What?</b>

554
00:28:03,894 --> 00:28:04,770
<b>He's not like that.</b>

555
00:28:07,356 --> 00:28:08,315
<b>His son...</b>

556
00:28:09,524 --> 00:28:11,276
<b>They say
that his son doesn't want to do it,</b>

557
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,779
<b>but he's forced to donate
to look like a good son.</b>

558
00:28:14,363 --> 00:28:15,614
<b>And they say</b>

559
00:28:16,073 --> 00:28:19,284
<b>some private security guards are
surveilling him in case he runs away.</b>

560

<b>-What are you looking for anyway?
-What?</b>

561
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:26,667
<b>A guardian came to me

562
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:29,211
<b>-But I don't know which room he's in.
-Oh, that? I fixed that.</b>

563
00:28:31,046 --> 00:28:32,589
<b>-When?
-A while ago.</b>

564
00:28:32,673 --> 00:28:33,965
<b>How?</b>

565
00:28:34,758 --> 00:28:36,259
<b>It wasn't plugged in properly.</b>

566
00:28:39,971 --> 00:28:41,556
<b>You didn't eat yet, right?</b>

567
00:28:42,933 --> 00:28:45,352
<b>Jeez. You should go and eat first.</b>

568
00:28:45,852 --> 00:28:48,772
<b>I'll sit here and take care
of things here.</b>

569
00:28:48,855 --> 00:28:51,274
<b>No, you should go home.
Your son must be waiting.</b>

570
00:28:51,358 --> 00:28:53,735
<b>Tomorrow is the weekend.
I'll play with him then.</b>

<b>This feels nice. How nice.</b>

572
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,949
<b>What should I watch?</b>

573
00:28:59,032 --> 00:29:01,076
<b>You really look like a single father now.</b>

574
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,661
<b>Right.</b>

575
00:29:03,078 --> 00:29:04,871
<b>Before, I lived the life
of a single father,</b>

576
00:29:04,955 --> 00:29:05,789
<b>but it's even true on paper, too.</b>

577
00:29:06,998 --> 00:29:08,375
<b>I'm really a single father now.</b>

578
00:29:08,458 --> 00:29:09,960
<b>Raising is a kid hard, isn't it?</b>

579
00:29:10,043 --> 00:29:11,962
<b>Being a doctor must be hard enough.</b>

580
00:29:12,045 --> 00:29:15,340
<b>It's hard. But my son...</b>

581
00:29:18,218 --> 00:29:20,721
<b>But I love my son to pieces.</b>

582
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:31,022
<b>Father, lift me, please.</b>

583
00:29:33,316 --> 00:29:34,401
<b>What should we get?</b>

584
00:29:34,901 --> 00:29:37,195
<b>You get ham and cheese.</b>

585
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:38,989
<b>So ham and cheese for me. What about you?</b>

586
00:29:39,239 --> 00:29:40,741
<b>I'll get Avoholic.</b>

587
00:29:40,824 --> 00:29:44,745
<b>You'll get Avoholic. And I'm U-ju-holic.</b>

588
00:29:45,245 --> 00:29:46,913
<b>Then, I'm Dad-holic.</b>

589
00:29:50,041 --> 00:29:53,795
<b>Are you a genius? Did I make a genius?</b>

590
00:29:55,422 --> 00:29:56,423
<b>Give me a kiss.</b>

591
00:30:02,721 --> 00:30:04,973
<b>-Have you been here before?
-Yes.</b>

592
00:30:05,557 --> 00:30:08,143
<b>-Who did you come with?
-With Jang Mo-ne. My girlfriend.</b>

593
00:30:11,021 --> 00:30:14,065
<b>-Your girlfriend's name is Mo-ne?
-Yes.</b>

594
00:30:15,609 --> 00:30:16,943
<b>Was it just the two of you?</b>

595
00:30:17,444 --> 00:30:20,572
<b>No, we came here with Mo-ne's mom.</b>

596
00:30:21,573 --> 00:30:22,991
<b>I see. Is that so?</b>

597
00:30:30,582 --> 00:30:31,750
<b>-U-ju.
-Yes?</b>

598
00:30:32,626 --> 00:30:34,669
<b>If you miss your mom,</b>

599
00:30:35,295 --> 00:30:37,172

600
00:30:37,506 --> 00:30:41,218
<b>You say the word,

601
00:30:41,301 --> 00:30:43,929
<b>No, I'll tell her to come to you. Okay?</b>

602
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:51,269
<b>If she doesn't miss me,
I don't miss her, either.</b>

603
00:30:54,189 --> 00:30:56,149
<b>What do you mean she doesn't miss you?</b>

604
00:30:56,233 --> 00:30:58,777
<b>You're wrong. She misses you a lot.</b>

605
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:01,738
<b>She called me yesterday
and asked how you were doing.</b>

606
00:31:02,322 --> 00:31:03,406
<b>She calls me every day.</b>

607
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,911
<b>I just need you, Dad.</b>

608
00:31:07,994 --> 00:31:10,413
<b>You're my favorite person
in the entire universe.</b>

609
00:31:17,546 --> 00:31:19,339
<b>Dad, are you not going to eat that?</b>

610
00:31:23,593 --> 00:31:24,761
<b>I'm going to.</b>

611
00:31:29,182 --> 00:31:30,308
<b>Father.</b>

612
00:31:32,143 --> 00:31:34,771
<b>Can you buy me one more sandwich, please?</b>

613
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,240
<b>Father, you have a visitor.</b>

614
00:31:45,323 --> 00:31:48,118
<b>Oh, him? It's my younger brother.
He said he'd come see me.</b>

615
00:31:48,201 --> 00:31:50,328
<b>-I don't think it's him.
-What?</b>

616
00:31:51,746 --> 00:31:52,789
<b>He's handsome.</b>

617
00:31:53,415 --> 00:31:54,249
<b>I see.</b>

618
00:32:04,217 --> 00:32:05,552
<b>Were you playing baseball?</b>

619
00:32:06,136 --> 00:32:07,762
<b>No. I came from home.</b>

620
00:32:08,263 --> 00:32:10,849
<b>Do you not have anyone
to spend your weekend with?</b>

621
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:13,310
<b>I'll go see Mom later.</b>

622
00:32:14,102 --> 00:32:16,688
<b>You are not going on a date? You punk.</b>

623
00:32:18,023 --> 00:32:19,816
<b>You're wasting your good days.</b>

624
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,736
<b>What are you talking about?
Why would I go on a date?</b>

625
00:32:23,862 --> 00:32:25,030
<b>I'm not interested.</b>

626
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,868
<b>By the way,
I still haven't gotten an answer yet.</b>

627
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:33,288
<b>I sent the recommendation letter
almost two months ago.</b>

628
00:32:33,788 --> 00:32:35,957
<b>You'll get it soon. Just wait.</b>

629
00:32:36,541 --> 00:32:37,375
<b>Oh, that reminds me.</b>

630
00:32:37,876 --> 00:32:39,085
<b>Did you...</b>

631
00:32:39,669 --> 00:32:41,254
<b>Did you tell Mom?</b>

632
00:32:44,007 --> 00:32:46,092
<b>I'm planning to tell her today.</b>

633
00:32:46,176 --> 00:32:48,178
<b>She'll pass out today.</b>

634
00:32:48,261 --> 00:32:50,263
<b>I'm sure she'll understand.</b>

635
00:32:50,764 --> 00:32:52,057
<b>What?</b>

636
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:56,728
<b>She encouraged all of you
when you were called by God.</b>

637
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,898
<b>I believe in Mom.</b>

638
00:33:01,066 --> 00:33:03,151
<b>She's not like the others.</b>

639
00:33:05,028 --> 00:33:05,904
<b>What?</b>

640
00:33:07,405 --> 00:33:08,907
<b>Mom!</b>

641
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:10,200
<b>Mom!</b>

642
00:33:10,492 --> 00:33:12,869
<b>Please hear me out.</b>

643
00:33:13,203 --> 00:33:14,371
<b>Mom!</b>

644
00:33:37,435 --> 00:33:38,436
<b>Mom.</b>

645
00:33:42,649 --> 00:33:43,858
<b>I'm fine.</b>

646
00:33:44,859 --> 00:33:47,612
<b>There are stairs all the way down.
Get on my back now.</b>

647
00:33:53,493 --> 00:33:56,287
<b>All right. Hold on tight.</b>

648
00:34:02,877 --> 00:34:06,256
<b>Mom, should we have
spicy noodles for dinner tonight?</b>

649
00:34:06,756 --> 00:34:08,550
<b>Call Song-hwa.</b>

650
00:34:08,633 --> 00:34:09,926
<b>Ask her to come for dinner.</b>

651
00:34:10,885 --> 00:34:12,721
<b>I really like her.</b>

652
00:34:12,804 --> 00:34:14,848
<b>She's calm and kind.</b>

653
00:34:14,931 --> 00:34:16,599
<b>Why would she join us for dinner?</b>

654
00:34:16,725 --> 00:34:18,476
<b>I told you she's just a friend.</b>

655
00:34:18,935 --> 00:34:20,937
<b>Besides, she's not calm at all.</b>

656
00:34:21,646 --> 00:34:23,356
<b>She is a wild one.</b>

657

<b>-Do you know who she is?
-Yes.</b>

681

<b>We heard she's the goddess of delivery.</b>

682

<b>You bet she is.
She's been working for 15 years</b>

<b>as a nurse in the delivery room.</b>

684

<b>She had to deliver her own baby,

<b>As long as we have her,

<b>You're just as I remember.
You haven't changed at all.</b>

<b>My gosh, people shouldn't change.</b>

688

<b>But we got new professors

00:37:38,468 --> 00:37:41,179
<b>Just one. A young doctor who seems sullen.</b>

<b>-I've never met him before.
-You mean Professor Yang Seok-hyeong.</b>

<b>Mine. I'm assisting the delivery.</b>

695

<b>Do a good job.</b>

696
00:37:55,485 --> 00:37:57,237
<b>What's anencephaly?</b>

697
00:37:58,488 --> 00:37:59,406
<b>A baby without a brain.</b>

698
00:38:02,117 --> 00:38:04,911
<b>We suspected the baby had anencephaly
during an ultrasound at 13 weeks.</b>

699
00:38:04,995 --> 00:38:07,330
<b>We're not allowed to induce abortion.</b>

700
00:38:07,414 --> 00:38:09,875
<b>And the mother wanted
to give birth anyway.</b>

701
00:38:10,417 --> 00:38:12,961
<b>She's now 32 weeks pregnant.

703

<b>I think the baby will come out
this afternoon.</b>

704
00:38:18,633 --> 00:38:23,305
<b>The baby can only live for a few hours
or several days, the most.</b>

705
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:26,516
<b>That's enough. The rest is for us
to worry about and prepare for.</b>

706
00:38:26,808 --> 00:38:29,519
<b>Professor Yang will take the patient?</b>

707
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,897
<b>Actually, he wanted to see me.</b>

708
00:38:34,399 --> 00:38:35,859
<b>Who's in my anencephaly case today?</b>

709
00:38:35,942 --> 00:38:38,361
<b>-I'm assisting you.
-I see.</b>

710
00:38:38,445 --> 00:38:40,447
<b>Min-ha, I need to talk to you then.</b>

711
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:42,866
<b>Me? Okay. Sure.</b>

712
00:38:44,826 --> 00:38:46,369
<b>You want me to cover the mouth?</b>

713
00:38:46,995 --> 00:38:48,789
<b>Don't block the nose or the airway.</b>

714
00:38:49,372 --> 00:38:52,167
<b>Just cover the mouth gently,
so we don't hear the baby cry.</b>

715
00:38:53,376 --> 00:38:55,545
<b>Eun-won can't
because she has to assist me.</b>

716
00:38:56,505 --> 00:38:58,131
<b>So, you come in
and cover the baby's mouth.</b>

717
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:01,426
<b>Do it as soon as the baby's born.</b>

718
00:39:02,344 --> 00:39:03,178
<b>Understood?</b>

719
00:39:12,312 --> 00:39:13,522
<b>The X-ray shows no problem.</b>

720
00:39:13,605 --> 00:39:15,774
<b>He also has no fever.
Maybe I called you for no reason.</b>

721
00:39:15,857 --> 00:39:17,609
<b>I even called you last night.</b>

722
00:39:17,943 --> 00:39:20,612
<b>She's just worried since
it hasn't been long since his surgery.</b>

723
00:39:21,196 --> 00:39:22,155
<b>We'll just have to deal with it.</b>

724
00:39:23,156 --> 00:39:24,866
<b>Why did Jin-yong return?
What's the matter?</b>

725
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:27,702
<b>He's fine now. I'm sorry, Professor.</b>

726
00:39:27,786 --> 00:39:29,579
<b>Jin-yong kept throwing up last night</b>

727
00:39:29,663 --> 00:39:31,915
<b>so he was brought to the ER.
But he's okay now.</b>

728
00:39:32,082 --> 00:39:34,543
<b>Then... Is there any other problem?</b>

729
00:39:35,043 --> 00:39:36,795
<b>What about his fever
and abdominal distention?</b>

730
00:39:36,878 --> 00:39:38,839
<b>His fever broke
after I gave him a fever reducer.</b>

731
00:39:38,922 --> 00:39:40,298
<b>He's better after vomiting once.</b>

732
00:39:40,382 --> 00:39:42,551
<b>He has no other problems
and we explained everything.</b>

733
00:39:42,634 --> 00:39:45,762
<b>But his mother insisted
on seeing you, so...</b>

734
00:39:45,846 --> 00:39:46,972
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

735
00:39:47,556 --> 00:39:48,974
<b>No, it's okay.</b>

736
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:54,563
<b>Dr. Bae, a patient with a fracture

<b>Sure.</b>

738
00:39:55,856 --> 00:39:57,274
<b>Let's see.</b>

739
00:39:58,733 --> 00:40:02,946
<b>Ma'am, his intestine is fine,
so you don't have to worry too much.</b>

740
00:40:03,697 --> 00:40:07,951
<b>Jin-yong, you think
you can eat something now?</b>

741
00:40:08,034 --> 00:40:10,996
<b>Oh, my. You look haggard.
Your cheeks are hollow.</b>

742
00:40:12,038 --> 00:40:14,624
<b>It hurts, doesn't it? I'm sorry.</b>

743
00:40:15,208 --> 00:40:16,710
<b>What happened?</b>

744
00:40:16,793 --> 00:40:19,004
<b>He was playing on a dining table
and suddenly fell.</b>

745
00:40:19,504 --> 00:40:21,464
<b>Since then, he hasn't been able
to move his arm.</b>

746
00:40:21,548 --> 00:40:23,884
<b>He fell on his right side.</b>

747
00:40:23,967 --> 00:40:25,844
<b>I think he broke his arm.</b>

748
00:40:26,344 --> 00:40:28,180
<b>Please do something. Please.</b>

749
00:40:29,181 --> 00:40:31,683
<b>How do you feel
when I press here and here?</b>

750
00:40:32,017 --> 00:40:33,310
<b>Do they feel the same?</b>

751
00:40:33,894 --> 00:40:35,353
<b>Is your head okay?</b>

752
00:40:36,229 --> 00:40:37,606
<b>Does it hurt here too?</b>

753
00:40:38,607 --> 00:40:40,150
<b>Take a deep breath.</b>

754
00:40:41,151 --> 00:40:42,569
<b>Does it hurt when you breathe?</b>

755
00:40:44,821 --> 00:40:46,615
<b>I think we should X-ray his chest too.</b>

756
00:40:47,782 --> 00:40:50,243
<b>Did he fall on his arm?</b>

757
00:40:50,869 --> 00:40:53,288
<b>Didn't he hit his chest hard on something?</b>

758
00:40:54,039 --> 00:40:55,665
<b>-Okay.
-I'm not sure.</b>

759
00:40:55,916 --> 00:40:59,920
<b>But I heard a really loud sound
when he fell from the table.</b>

760
00:41:00,086 --> 00:41:02,130
<b>He fell really hard on his right side.</b>

761
00:41:02,214 --> 00:41:06,801
<b>I think his arm is broken,
and there must be a chest problem too.</b>

762
00:41:06,885 --> 00:41:08,386
<b>So we should X-ray him first.</b>

763
00:41:08,887 --> 00:41:13,475
<b>But I heard...
X-rays are bad for children.</b>

764
00:41:13,558 --> 00:41:15,769
<b>Is it really necessary?</b>

765
00:41:15,852 --> 00:41:17,646
<b>It's okay
since the radiation is very little.</b>

766
00:41:17,729 --> 00:41:20,315
<b>I see... All right, then.</b>

767
00:41:20,982 --> 00:41:23,401
<b>Goodness, Doctor. Whatever you do,</b>

768
00:41:23,485 --> 00:41:25,487
<b>please hurry and stop his pain.</b>

769
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:27,197
<b>I will. Don't worry.</b>

770
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,991
<b>Let's the X-ray done.
And give him some painkiller.</b>

771
00:41:30,075 --> 00:41:31,034
<b>Yes.</b>

772
00:41:35,497 --> 00:41:38,541
<b>Professor, they say the Kasai's
operation's ready. You should go.</b>

773
00:41:38,625 --> 00:41:39,542
<b>Okay.</b>

774
00:41:42,379 --> 00:41:43,880
<b>You haven't received an enema, right?</b>

775
00:41:44,339 --> 00:41:46,258
<b>He'll get it later this evening.</b>

776
00:41:46,758 --> 00:41:49,302
<b>That's all he needs to do
before surgery, right?</b>

777
00:41:50,762 --> 00:41:52,931
<b>Why are there so many things to do
for preparation?</b>

778
00:41:53,098 --> 00:41:55,016
<b>He'll be exhausted
even before the surgery.</b>

779
00:41:56,017 --> 00:41:58,103
<b>A transplant recipient
usually has a lot to prepare.</b>

780
00:41:58,186 --> 00:41:59,688
<b>The surgery takes a long time as well.</b>

781
00:41:59,771 --> 00:42:03,525
<b>So... Did you say it'll take
about ten hours?</b>

782
00:42:04,484 --> 00:42:07,153
<b>We'll only know for sure
after the surgery begins.</b>

783
00:42:07,237 --> 00:42:10,448
<b>But you're right.
It usually takes nine to ten hours.</b>

784
00:42:12,534 --> 00:42:14,619
<b>But as for your son,</b>

785
00:42:14,703 --> 00:42:17,455
<b>if I take out the time for
anesthetizing and closing his chest,</b>

786
00:42:17,539 --> 00:42:19,457
<b>the surgery will take only
about four hours. So it's better.</b>

787
00:42:19,541 --> 00:42:22,252
<b>He won't have any side effects
after his surgery, right?</b>

788
00:42:22,919 --> 00:42:26,673
<b>I mean, he's getting a liver transplant
to get better after all.</b>

789
00:42:27,257 --> 00:42:28,258
<b>Well...</b>

790
00:42:28,633 --> 00:42:31,303
<b>It's not that
he's getting it to get better.</b>

791
00:42:31,386 --> 00:42:34,848
<b>The liver transplant is the only way
for him to live.</b>

792
00:42:34,931 --> 00:42:37,642
<b>Your son is doing a great thing.</b>

793
00:42:38,852 --> 00:42:41,813
<b>You should know that not everyone does it
for their family or parents.</b>

794
00:42:41,896 --> 00:42:44,941
<b>Not doing it is also understandable.</b>

795
00:42:45,025 --> 00:42:45,859
<b>I see...</b>

796
00:42:46,985 --> 00:42:48,987
<b>We took an x-ray because of your cough.</b>

797
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:51,031
<b>-How does it look?
-It looked fine.</b>

798
00:42:52,032 --> 00:42:53,158
<b>Then it's all good.</b>

799
00:42:53,241 --> 00:42:54,659
<b>See you tomorrow.</b>

800
00:42:54,784 --> 00:42:57,078
<b>Okay. Have a good rest today, Professor.</b>

801
00:42:57,162 --> 00:42:59,664
<b>Don't drink tonight,
and just go home and rest, okay?</b>

802
00:42:59,748 --> 00:43:01,207
<b>Yes, ma'am.</b>

803
00:43:01,291 --> 00:43:04,294
<b>Yes. He really told me
to cover the baby's mouth first.</b>

804
00:43:04,627 --> 00:43:07,589
<b>Clearly, he doesn't even
want to hear the baby crying.</b>

805
00:43:07,672 --> 00:43:10,675
<b>I'm telling you, he's a total psycho.</b>

806
00:43:13,178 --> 00:43:14,554
<b>Did he really say that?</b>

807
00:43:14,637 --> 00:43:16,097
<b>Did Dr. Yang Seok-hyeong say that?</b>

808
00:43:16,181 --> 00:43:18,725
<b>He told me that just a while ago.</b>

809
00:43:21,353 --> 00:43:23,897
<b>I didn't think he was that kind of doctor.
He has a different side.</b>

810
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:27,192
<b>What do you mean?
He does look like that type of doctor.</b>

811
00:43:27,901 --> 00:43:30,403
<b>He has no consideration
or affection for pregnant women.</b>

812
00:43:30,487 --> 00:43:32,947
<b>He's a simple, ignorant,
and selfish loner.</b>

813
00:43:33,031 --> 00:43:35,116
<b>He's exactly that kind of doctor.</b>

814
00:43:36,951 --> 00:43:39,871
<b>Dr. Chu, how long have you been
a resident?</b>

815
00:43:41,081 --> 00:43:42,165
<b>It's my second year.</b>

816
00:43:42,665 --> 00:43:43,833
<b>I see...</b>

817
00:43:45,251 --> 00:43:46,544
<b>Listen carefully.</b>

818
00:43:49,297 --> 00:43:52,801
<b><i>The patient with gastroschisis
went into labor and is in the ER now.</i></b>

819
00:43:52,884 --> 00:43:54,219
<b><i>Hurry up, Professor.</i></b>

820

<b>DELIVERY ROOM
RESTRICTIONS FOR VISITORS</b>

821
00:44:07,816 --> 00:44:09,818
<b>I think it's going too fast.</b>

822
00:44:09,901 --> 00:44:11,820
<b>The interval is too short.</b>

823

<b>We planned to induce labor next week,</b>

826
00:44:19,953 --> 00:44:21,162
<b>but she has labor pain now.</b>

827
00:44:21,246 --> 00:44:23,331
<b>Her husband's pretty shaken up.</b>

828
00:44:23,415 --> 00:44:25,917
<b>It's okay. You don't have to worry.</b>

829
00:44:27,168 --> 00:44:28,753
<b>The cervix is dilated to 3cm,</b>

830
00:44:28,837 --> 00:44:30,922

<b>I'm worried.</b>

834
00:44:55,613 --> 00:44:57,240
<b>He's mentally unstable.</b>

835
00:44:57,824 --> 00:44:59,200
<b>He refused all the visitors.</b>

836
00:44:59,909 --> 00:45:01,744
<b>He took a blood test and an X-ray, right?</b>

837
00:45:01,828 --> 00:45:03,037
<b>Yes, of course.</b>

838

<b>But since then,
he hasn't come out of the room.</b>

<b>He seemed fine

<b>You don't think he'd run away, do you?</b>

841
00:45:15,049 --> 00:45:16,426
<b>I don't think so.</b>

842
00:45:22,974 --> 00:45:24,851
<b>It's 3cm, so we still have some time.</b>

843
00:45:24,934 --> 00:45:26,728
<b>-You called the Pediatrics, right?
-Yes.</b>

844

<b>What about Pediatric Surgery?</b>

845
00:45:28,146 --> 00:45:30,857
<b>You haven't called Jeong-won yet, right?
We still have some time.</b>

<b>No, not yet.</b>

847
00:45:31,941 --> 00:45:33,985
<b>I talked with their chief doctor

<b>Dr. Ahn's surgery that started

<b>He hasn't eaten anything all day,</b>

<b>so he'll come after eating something.</b>

851
00:45:40,909 --> 00:45:42,869
<b>That's good. I'll be in my office then.</b>

852

<b>I heard it's still 3cm.</b>

<b>Yes.</b>

854

<b>Then she still has a long way to go.</b>

855

<b>Don't tell me you already called PS?</b>

<b>Of course not.

<b>Yes, sir.</b>

865
00:46:27,455 --> 00:46:30,250
<b>What do I do? I told PS they could go eat.</b>

866

<b>Okay. Please take a long breath.</b>

890
00:48:17,065 --> 00:48:19,359
<b>Good. You're doing a good job.</b>

891
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:22,737
<b>It's almost done. Just a bit more.</b>

892
00:48:23,446 --> 00:48:26,282
<b>Good. You're doing a good job, ma'am.</b>

893
00:48:26,783 --> 00:48:29,827
<b>Okay, with all your might,
push one last time.</b>

894
00:48:29,911 --> 00:48:32,163
<b>Good. One more time.</b>

895
00:48:34,332 --> 00:48:35,750
<b>One more.</b>

896
00:48:36,918 --> 00:48:37,835
<b>More.</b>

897
00:48:38,836 --> 00:48:39,754
<b>More.</b>

898
00:48:40,254 --> 00:48:43,800
<b>Hang in there. You're doing a good job.</b>

899
00:48:46,302 --> 00:48:49,263
<b>Good. The baby has come out.</b>

900
00:49:23,381 --> 00:49:24,966
<b>You did a good job.</b>

901
00:49:25,550 --> 00:49:27,176
<b>You've really done well.</b>

902
00:49:29,137 --> 00:49:30,138
<b>Doctor...</b>

903
00:49:33,015 --> 00:49:34,350
<b>I feel...</b>

904
00:49:35,351 --> 00:49:36,686
<b>so sorry for my baby.</b>

905
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:39,188
<b>My baby...</b>

906
00:49:42,525 --> 00:49:43,901
<b>Ma'am,</b>

907
00:49:44,402 --> 00:49:46,654
<b>You didn't give up on the baby
until the end.</b>

908
00:49:48,239 --> 00:49:50,199
<b>That alone is amazing.</b>

909
00:49:51,409 --> 00:49:55,037
<b>You really did your best, ma'am.</b>

910
00:50:01,169 --> 00:50:04,422
<b>You've done a great job.</b>

911
00:50:18,686 --> 00:50:21,689
<b>Dr. Chu, how long have you been
a resident?</b>

912
00:50:22,899 --> 00:50:23,983
<b>It's my second year.</b>

913
00:50:24,942 --> 00:50:26,110
<b>Listen carefully.</b>

914
00:50:27,069 --> 00:50:29,947
<b>I've been worried about that mother
for a while,</b>

915
00:50:30,031 --> 00:50:31,949
<b>so I went to see her a little while ago.</b>

916
00:50:32,992 --> 00:50:35,995
<b>I asked her if she wants to see the baby
when it's born.</b>

917
00:50:36,078 --> 00:50:39,415
<b>I told her I can show her if she wants to.</b>

918
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,752
<b>She thought it over and told me that</b>

919
00:50:44,295 --> 00:50:45,338
<b>she doesn't want to</b>

920
00:50:46,339 --> 00:50:50,134
<b>because if she sees the baby,
it might be too hard for her.</b>

921
00:50:52,136 --> 00:50:55,807
<b>She hasn't gotten an abortion until now.</b>

922
00:50:55,890 --> 00:50:57,225
<b>That alone is great.</b>

923
00:50:58,768 --> 00:51:02,146
<b>But when I was coming out of the room,</b>

924
00:51:02,814 --> 00:51:05,233
<b>I saw Dr. Yang standing outside the door.</b>

925
00:51:05,733 --> 00:51:07,819
<b>He came to ask me a favor.</b>

926
00:51:09,403 --> 00:51:11,447
<b>He said, "When the baby's born later,</b>

927
00:51:12,031 --> 00:51:15,326
<b>if it starts crying,</b>

928
00:51:17,036 --> 00:51:19,497
<b>could you play really loud music?</b>

929
00:51:20,665 --> 00:51:23,292
<b>I asked another person a different thing,</b>

930
00:51:23,376 --> 00:51:26,087
<b>but I'm asking you too just in case."</b>

931
00:51:28,422 --> 00:51:29,507
<b>Yes.</b>

932
00:51:30,591 --> 00:51:31,759
<b>Come further inside.</b>

933
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:33,261
<b>Yes.</b>

934
00:51:33,469 --> 00:51:35,847
<b><i>I understood what he meant right away.</i></b>

935
00:51:36,681 --> 00:51:39,058
<b>But it was so unlike him,</b>

936
00:51:39,141 --> 00:51:40,685
<b>so I asked him as if I didn't get it.</b>

937
00:51:40,768 --> 00:51:42,395
<b>"Why should I play loud music?"</b>

938
00:51:44,105 --> 00:51:46,732
<b>He said,
"The mother already knows about it</b>

939
00:51:46,858 --> 00:51:48,818
<b>and has prepared herself.</b>

940
00:51:49,527 --> 00:51:53,239
<b>But still, if she hears the cry</b>

941
00:51:53,823 --> 00:51:55,575
<b>when the baby is born,</b>

942
00:51:56,033 --> 00:51:58,870
<b>she'll be traumatized for life."</b>

943
00:52:05,459 --> 00:52:06,460
<b>Mom.</b>

944
00:52:08,337 --> 00:52:09,714
<b>Did you see the doctor?</b>

945
00:52:09,797 --> 00:52:11,507
<b>I told them to take good care of you.</b>

946
00:52:11,591 --> 00:52:13,384
<b>Yes, it went well.</b>

947
00:52:13,467 --> 00:52:14,886
<b>They said everything's fine.</b>

948
00:52:14,969 --> 00:52:17,138
<b>It's just that my legs feel weak.</b>

949
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,599
<b>-I need to go to the restroom.
-Sure.</b>

950
00:52:19,682 --> 00:52:22,935
<b>He said he didn't want
to make her traumatized</b>

951
00:52:23,019 --> 00:52:25,187
<b>after all she's been through.</b>

952
00:52:26,814 --> 00:52:28,774
<b>The mother is aware of everything
about the baby</b>

953
00:52:28,858 --> 00:52:30,651
<b>and has prepared herself.</b>

954
00:52:31,277 --> 00:52:35,031
<b>But he thinks
she'll be traumatized for life.</b>

955
00:52:35,698 --> 00:52:36,699
<b>Oh, my.</b>

956
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:40,536
<b>He looks quite dull,</b>

957
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:42,663
<b>so I didn't think he'd care about
small things.</b>

958
00:52:42,747 --> 00:52:44,165
<b>That was unexpected.</b>

959
00:52:44,248 --> 00:52:46,709
<b>You know, it's not easy
to be thoughtful like that.</b>

960
00:52:46,792 --> 00:52:51,130
<b>Then he should've told me
the reason first.</b>

961
00:52:51,213 --> 00:52:52,924
<b>Does he really have to say it out loud?</b>

962
00:52:53,633 --> 00:52:55,468
<b>You should've gotten it right away.</b>

963
00:52:56,969 --> 00:52:57,929
<b>Oh, no...</b>

964
00:53:02,642 --> 00:53:04,852
<b>You even eat green onion kimchi now?</b>

965
00:53:04,936 --> 00:53:06,270
<b>You didn't like it before.</b>

966
00:53:06,354 --> 00:53:07,480
<b>I suddenly like it.</b>

967
00:53:08,314 --> 00:53:11,108
<b>I crave cold bean soup noodles these days.</b>

968
00:53:11,192 --> 00:53:12,485
<b>I never liked it before.</b>

969
00:53:12,985 --> 00:53:15,529
<b>-Our taste in food changes as we grow old.
-Yes, but not gradually.</b>

970
00:53:15,613 --> 00:53:17,573
<b>It changes overnight. All of a sudden.</b>

971
00:53:17,865 --> 00:53:19,825
<b>I suddenly became allergic to cats.</b>

972
00:53:19,909 --> 00:53:21,869
<b>I was never allergic to anything.</b>

973
00:53:21,953 --> 00:53:24,705
<b>I suddenly developed presbyopia
on Christmas morning last year.</b>

974
00:53:24,789 --> 00:53:26,332
<b>My girlfriend asked me if I liked</b>

975
00:53:26,415 --> 00:53:28,668
<b>something on her phone,
but I couldn't see it at all.</b>

976
00:53:28,751 --> 00:53:29,877
<b>I just said I liked it.</b>

977
00:53:31,045 --> 00:53:33,047
<b>Two days ago, I went to the park with U-ju</b>

978
00:53:33,923 --> 00:53:35,716
<b>and took 6,000 photos of flowers.</b>

979
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:37,843
<b>I'm serious. I took 6,000 photos.</b>

980
00:53:37,927 --> 00:53:40,054
<b>Don't laugh.
I took them without realizing it.</b>

981
00:53:40,304 --> 00:53:41,722
<b>And U-ju was...</b>

982
00:53:41,806 --> 00:53:43,766
<b>They were selling bean soup there.</b>

983
00:53:43,849 --> 00:53:47,603
<b>So U-ju was eating it, and I was suddenly
immersed in those flowers.</b>

984
00:53:47,687 --> 00:53:49,772
<b>-I'll show you.
-No, thanks.</b>

985
00:53:49,855 --> 00:53:51,565
<b>-Look at them.
-I'm okay.</b>

986
00:53:51,774 --> 00:53:54,443
<b>Well, Seok-hyeong's worse.</b>

987
00:53:54,527 --> 00:53:57,113
<b>-Of course. He's the worst.
-He's the worst.</b>

988
00:53:57,405 --> 00:54:00,574
<b>He never talked with his mom,
but now he's a mama's boy.</b>

989
00:54:00,658 --> 00:54:03,202
<b>He was really brusque with his mom.</b>

990
00:54:03,285 --> 00:54:05,079
<b>He talked behind her back a lot,</b>

991
00:54:05,162 --> 00:54:07,415
<b>saying she was so spiteful and scary.</b>

992
00:54:07,581 --> 00:54:10,376
<b>You never know how people turn out.</b>

993
00:54:10,543 --> 00:54:12,461
<b>Anyone would be like that</b>

994
00:54:12,837 --> 00:54:14,296
<b>after going through all of that at once.</b>

995
00:54:15,297 --> 00:54:18,592
<b>He was close to his little sister,
but she suddenly died.</b>

996
00:54:19,427 --> 00:54:21,262
<b>And his father had an affair
with a young woman,</b>

997
00:54:21,345 --> 00:54:22,847
<b>His mom then had a stroke.</b>

998
00:54:23,347 --> 00:54:27,810
<b>Gosh... I think only Seok-hyeong
can endure all that.</b>

999
00:54:28,019 --> 00:54:28,894
<b>If it were me...</b>

1000
00:54:29,311 --> 00:54:30,980
<b>How's his mom doing these days?</b>

1001
00:54:31,063 --> 00:54:33,274
<b>I heard she'd come here today.
Didn't she go to you?</b>

1002
00:54:33,357 --> 00:54:34,900
<b>She came to see a neurologist today.</b>

1003
00:54:34,984 --> 00:54:36,944
<b>She is a lot better.
She can go out by herself now.</b>

1004
00:54:38,112 --> 00:54:41,907
<b>So he was going to see his mom
if he has time after the delivery.</b>

1005
00:54:42,408 --> 00:54:43,993
<b>I wonder if he met her.</b>

1006
00:54:45,536 --> 00:54:47,246
<b>I'm okay.</b>

1007
00:54:54,170 --> 00:54:55,838
<b>Excuse me.</b>

1008
00:54:55,921 --> 00:54:57,339
<b>I'm sorry, but...</b>

1009
00:54:57,423 --> 00:55:00,301
<b>The woman who just went in is my mother.</b>

1010
00:55:00,384 --> 00:55:02,553
<b>She has trouble moving around
after having surgery.</b>

1011
00:55:02,636 --> 00:55:04,680
<b>-I see.
-I'm sorry, but...</b>

1012
00:55:04,764 --> 00:55:07,141
<b>I'm just worried
that she might collapse in there.</b>

1013
00:55:07,224 --> 00:55:11,228
<b>If it's not too much trouble for you,
could you keep an eye on her?</b>

1014
00:55:11,312 --> 00:55:14,774
<b>If you could just watch her
once or twice if she's okay...</b>

1015
00:55:15,316 --> 00:55:16,817
<b>I'd appreciate it. I'm sorry.</b>

1016
00:55:16,901 --> 00:55:19,403
<b>No, don't be. I'll go watch her now.</b>

1017
00:55:28,329 --> 00:55:31,791
<b><i>Seok-hyeong's father
is beyond our imagination.</i></b>

1018
00:55:31,874 --> 00:55:33,209
<b><i>He doesn't deserve to be a father.</i></b>

1019
00:55:33,292 --> 00:55:35,461
<b>Even Seok-hyeong doesn't call him
his father anymore.</b>

1020
00:55:36,253 --> 00:55:38,130
<b>They didn't get a divorce yet, right?</b>

1021
00:55:38,214 --> 00:55:41,425
<b>Right. His mom's absolutely against it.</b>

1022
00:55:41,926 --> 00:55:43,803
<b>She'll never do it.</b>

1023
00:55:44,303 --> 00:55:45,888
<b>You should go in now. I know you're busy.</b>

1024
00:55:45,971 --> 00:55:47,348
<b>I will after I see you get a cab.</b>

1025
00:55:47,431 --> 00:55:48,766
<b>I know how to get a cab.</b>

1026
00:55:48,849 --> 00:55:51,560
<b>I called a cab.
I'll go back after you get in.</b>

1027
00:55:52,144 --> 00:55:54,063
<b>What about Song-hwa? Is she busy?</b>

1028
00:55:54,146 --> 00:55:55,397
<b>Why don't you call her?</b>

1029
00:55:56,565 --> 00:55:59,110
<b>Tell her to come down and get some coffee.</b>

1030
00:55:59,193 --> 00:56:00,861
<b>Mom, we're really just friends.</b>

1031
00:56:00,945 --> 00:56:03,447
<b>There's nothing going on between us,
so stop that.</b>

1032
00:56:03,531 --> 00:56:04,782
<b>I didn't say anything.</b>

1033
00:56:04,865 --> 00:56:08,828
<b>I just want to see her
since I'm at the hospital.</b>

1034
00:56:08,911 --> 00:56:10,996
<b>Why are you getting so worked up?</b>

1035
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:12,832
<b>Is there really something going on?</b>

1036
00:56:12,915 --> 00:56:14,250
<b>The cab's here. You should go.</b>

1037
00:56:20,339 --> 00:56:21,590
<b>-Bye, mom.
-Bye.</b>

1038
00:56:26,303 --> 00:56:28,722
<b><i>Seok-hyeong, come home right away.</i></b>

1039

<b>Ik-jun and Jun-wan were in a band

<b>Jun-wan plays the guitar.</b>

1160

<b>They joined a med school band,</b>

<b>but they left
because things weren't right for them.</b>

1162

<b>Then they started their own band for fun.</b>

1163
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:52,499
<b>Luckily, Seok-hyeong was good at piano,</b>

1164
01:03:52,791 --> 01:03:54,960
<b>and I think Jeong-won started

<b>She's the vocalist?</b>

<b>Yes, she is.</b>

<b>That's right. I know that.
Actually, everyone knows that.</b>

1170

<b>But Song-hwa lied to them.</b>

1171
01:04:06,179 --> 01:04:08,682
<b>-Sorry?
-She's really good at lying.</b>

1172
01:04:08,765 --> 01:04:10,767
<b>When she sets her mind

<b>she'll get it at all means.</b>

<b>He looks just like him, right?</b>

1237
01:13:18,761 --> 01:13:22,682
<b>I was surprised too,

<b>Why? Why should a guardian leave?</b>

1250

<b>What's wrong with the patient?</b>

1254
01:14:09,979 --> 01:14:12,732
<b>He was in his dad's car

<b>What kind of father would let that happen?</b>

1256
01:14:15,151 --> 01:14:16,694
<b>It can happen when you drive.</b>

1257

<b>But the father seemed totally fine.</b>

1258

1259

<b>He's covered in bruises.</b>

1260

<b>Jae-yong, lie on your stomach.</b>
