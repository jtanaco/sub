1
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:10,285
(Episode 9)

2
00:00:47,497 --> 00:00:49,795
How did you know I was here?

3
00:00:52,536 --> 00:00:54,295
What's wrong?

4
00:00:54,571 --> 00:00:56,595
Is something going on?

5
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,135
It's all right now.

6
00:00:59,242 --> 00:01:01,005
It's all right.

7
00:01:05,749 --> 00:01:07,315
What?

8
00:01:09,052 --> 00:01:10,250
Who are you?

9
00:01:10,253 --> 00:01:11,450
Who do you think you are to suddenly run in...

10
00:01:11,455 --> 00:01:12,850
and why are you hugging her out of nowhere?

11
00:01:12,856 --> 00:01:15,255
Then who are you?

12
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,390
It's Anchor Lee.

13
00:01:17,394 --> 00:01:19,025
It is him.

14
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:20,630
He's her boyfriend.

15
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:23,160
"Boyfriend"? Is that true?

16
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,795
Yes. I'm her boyfriend.

17
00:01:26,236 --> 00:01:28,795
So what were you doing with her?

18
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,505
It's a misunderstanding. I made a mistake.

19
00:01:33,777 --> 00:01:36,010
There was an accident.

20
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:37,575
"An accident"?

21
00:01:40,217 --> 00:01:43,415
I was distracted for a split second...

22
00:01:44,721 --> 00:01:46,415
and crashed into their car.

23
00:01:46,756 --> 00:01:49,555
- Gosh. - Get out.

24
00:01:49,593 --> 00:01:51,790
- Gosh. - It's a brand new car.

25
00:01:51,795 --> 00:01:54,260
Are you okay? Oh, no.

26
00:01:54,264 --> 00:01:56,530
I'm sorry. I am.

27
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:59,130
This is totally my fault.

28
00:01:59,136 --> 00:02:01,800
I'll compensate for everything as you wish.

29
00:02:01,805 --> 00:02:03,365
Hold on.

30
00:02:04,007 --> 00:02:05,665
Are you...

31
00:02:06,109 --> 00:02:08,040
Yeo Ha Jin? You are, right?

32
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:09,040
No way.

33
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:13,745
We... We were just on our way back home after watching your movie.

34
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:18,385
Really? Yes, it's me.

35
00:02:19,322 --> 00:02:21,390
I can't believe this!

36
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:24,590
- Could we take a photo? - Can I shake your hand?

37
00:02:24,594 --> 00:02:26,660
- Sure. - Thank you.

38
00:02:26,663 --> 00:02:28,230
Let's take a photo too.

39
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:29,530
Let's go somewhere that's not too dark.

40
00:02:29,533 --> 00:02:32,195
- Sure. - Let's go.

41
00:02:32,636 --> 00:02:34,965
(Anchor Lee)

42
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:43,305
You called me a lot.

43
00:02:45,015 --> 00:02:47,645
You must've been worried sick.

44
00:02:48,618 --> 00:02:50,485
Don't misunderstand.

45
00:02:51,488 --> 00:02:53,420
Anyone would've gotten worried in this situation.

46
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:54,950
It's late.

47
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:57,990
You went to the movies alone, and I couldn't reach you.

48
00:02:57,994 --> 00:03:00,630
I see.

49
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,860
Is that why you called Ha Kyung incessantly...

50
00:03:02,866 --> 00:03:06,125
and went all the way to the movie theater?

51
00:03:07,504 --> 00:03:09,695
Okay, I won't misunderstand this.

52
00:03:12,342 --> 00:03:15,935
From now on, don't go anywhere alone.

53
00:03:17,814 --> 00:03:19,675
And be wary of people.

54
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:21,675
"People"?

55
00:03:24,888 --> 00:03:26,890
They're good people.

56
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:28,750
They were kind to me.

57
00:03:28,758 --> 00:03:29,920
Just because people are kind to you...

58
00:03:29,926 --> 00:03:32,455
that doesn't mean they're good people.

59
00:03:33,563 --> 00:03:35,925
Don't trust people so easily.

60
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:39,125
Okay, I'll be careful.

61
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,170
You're not a teenage runaway.

62
00:03:44,174 --> 00:03:46,470
Why would you go out so late at night and cause trouble?

63
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:48,340
I'm sorry. I knew you'd take at least three hours...

64
00:03:48,345 --> 00:03:49,570
to come home from the gym.

65
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:51,780
I was going to watch a movie and go home.

66
00:03:51,781 --> 00:03:52,940
I didn't know this would happen.

67
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:56,615
It's getting late. Get home safely. Goodbye.

68
00:03:56,853 --> 00:03:58,480
Already?

69
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:00,750
Then what? Are you going to work out together or something?

70
00:04:00,757 --> 00:04:02,150
Let's go.

71
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:04,190
Go home safely.

72
00:04:04,194 --> 00:04:05,560
You too.

73
00:04:05,562 --> 00:04:08,260
I'll text you when I arrive home.

74
00:04:08,265 --> 00:04:10,795
I don't want you to worry again.

75
00:04:10,934 --> 00:04:13,695
Okay, please do that.

76
00:04:14,804 --> 00:04:16,365
What?

77
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,835
Goodbye.

78
00:04:32,956 --> 00:04:34,690
What are you looking at?

79
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:37,355
I'm waiting to see if any photos are getting posted.

80
00:04:37,727 --> 00:04:39,590
Those men promised me...

81
00:04:39,596 --> 00:04:41,590
not to tell anyone about the accident.

82
00:04:41,598 --> 00:04:42,590
Don't worry about that.

83
00:04:42,599 --> 00:04:44,230
I'm not talking about those photos.

84
00:04:44,234 --> 00:04:45,530
Then what?

85
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:47,765
Photos of Anchor Lee and me.

86
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,280
It would've been nice if there were photos.

87
00:05:02,285 --> 00:05:04,120
I'd like to look at them whenever I wish.

88
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,350
There weren't many people.

89
00:05:06,356 --> 00:05:07,450
It's a shame.

90
00:05:07,457 --> 00:05:09,290
You should be relieved.

91
00:05:09,292 --> 00:05:10,290
Had more people been there,

92
00:05:10,293 --> 00:05:11,960
we wouldn't have been able to keep this on the low.

93
00:05:11,961 --> 00:05:14,155
I don't even want to imagine it.

94
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:18,160
Do you know what he said to those men?

95
00:05:18,168 --> 00:05:19,995
What?

96
00:05:20,337 --> 00:05:22,570
He said he was my boyfriend.

97
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:23,570
What?

98
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:27,135
He said that himself.

99
00:05:27,477 --> 00:05:29,010
What's going on?

100
00:05:29,012 --> 00:05:31,610
What do you think? It's a romance.

101
00:05:31,614 --> 00:05:34,345
After all, he ran over there because he was worried about me.

102
00:05:34,684 --> 00:05:37,480
You're right. He seemed pretty worried.

103
00:05:37,487 --> 00:05:39,615
He made it seem like something happened to you.

104
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:43,085
Yes. This is romance, indeed.

105
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:46,685
Are there seriously no photos of us?

106
00:05:52,369 --> 00:05:54,070
It's Jeong Hoon.

107
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:57,070
I need to talk to you regarding Ha Jin.

108
00:05:57,073 --> 00:05:59,665
Please call me when she's not around.

109
00:06:09,486 --> 00:06:11,345
What are these photos?

110
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:26,700
Jeong Hoon speaking.

111
00:06:26,703 --> 00:06:29,165
These photos were sent to you?

112
00:06:29,672 --> 00:06:32,400
Yes. I had received them a while ago,

113
00:06:32,409 --> 00:06:34,405
but I only opened them today.

114
00:06:34,778 --> 00:06:36,840
I didn't check every single one of them,

115
00:06:36,846 --> 00:06:40,345
but I don't think these photos were from articles or online.

116
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:44,815
Are you saying they took them while stalking her?

117
00:06:45,021 --> 00:06:47,420
Don't take it too seriously just yet.

118
00:06:47,424 --> 00:06:50,760
Like you said, she's a celebrity.

119
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,660
A fan of her could just be obsessed over her.

120
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,695
It's highly likely.

121
00:06:54,931 --> 00:06:56,525
But nevertheless,

122
00:06:56,566 --> 00:06:59,825
I thought you should know about this.

123
00:07:00,036 --> 00:07:02,195
It's better safe than sorry.

124
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:06,470
I'll keep this a secret from her. I don't want her to feel anxious.

125
00:07:06,476 --> 00:07:08,310
If you notice anyone suspicious around you...

126
00:07:08,311 --> 00:07:11,605
or receive strange mail, let me know right away.

127
00:07:11,915 --> 00:07:14,710
I will. Let me know as well.

128
00:07:14,717 --> 00:07:16,515
All right.

129
00:07:43,313 --> 00:07:44,975
My goodness!

130
00:07:46,249 --> 00:07:47,550
Who are you?

131
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,450
Who do you think? They're security guards.

132
00:07:50,453 --> 00:07:52,045
"Security guards"?

133
00:07:53,022 --> 00:07:54,220
My security guards?

134
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:55,420
We're late. Let's go.

135
00:07:55,425 --> 00:07:57,055
This way.

136
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,920
Why do I have security guards all of a sudden?

137
00:07:59,929 --> 00:08:03,030
What's going on? Tell me.

138
00:08:03,032 --> 00:08:05,795
Hey, your older sister is asking you a question.

139
00:08:06,002 --> 00:08:08,295
I'm going to get mad.

140
00:08:08,638 --> 00:08:11,040
Tell me.

141
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,105
- Put on your seatbelt. - We're departing.

142
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:20,550
All those men will be escorting me?

143
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:22,250
Stop asking.

144
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:24,020
Why would they?

145
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,320
I've been fine alone all this time.

146
00:08:25,321 --> 00:08:26,850
Things have changed now.

147
00:08:26,856 --> 00:08:29,020
You're no longer the old you.

148
00:08:29,025 --> 00:08:30,860
Plus, all the other celebrities have security guards.

149
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,260
We were the exception.

150
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:33,885
Right, Chul?

151
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,930
She's right. Your fan base grew significantly.

152
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:39,195
We can't manage them on our own anymore.

153
00:08:40,036 --> 00:08:42,435
I don't think it's that much.

154
00:09:06,029 --> 00:09:07,190
Did you look into it?

155
00:09:07,196 --> 00:09:09,290
I visited the post office.

156
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,100
But I got nothing.

157
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,160
The post office requires you to write down your information...

158
00:09:13,169 --> 00:09:15,870
in case the mail gets sent back.

159
00:09:15,872 --> 00:09:18,540
They said this mail was put in a mailbox.

160
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:20,510
We can't identify them through this.

161
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:23,535
And this type of envelope can be seen everywhere.

162
00:09:24,914 --> 00:09:27,550
Did I receive any more mail?

163
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:30,050
No. You did receive more,

164
00:09:30,053 --> 00:09:31,480
but none of them look suspicious.

165
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:33,685
Okay, I'm heading back right now.

166
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,485
("Romantic Nurse, Director Choi")

167
00:09:37,527 --> 00:09:39,690
These scripts are all for me?

168
00:09:39,696 --> 00:09:41,330
These were handpicked.

169
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:43,130
We had twice as much.

170
00:09:43,132 --> 00:09:44,830
We rejected any with you as a supporting actress.

171
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,370
You? Supporting actress? That's absurd.

172
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:48,730
You're the lead actress in all of those.

173
00:09:48,738 --> 00:09:50,070
We took out any that centered around the lead actor...

174
00:09:50,073 --> 00:09:52,370
and only picked the ones with you in the center.

175
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:54,340
What if the drama is a flop?

176
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:56,710
Can I just be a supporting actress?

177
00:09:56,713 --> 00:09:58,380
It won't be a flop.

178
00:09:58,381 --> 00:10:00,140
You need to be in the limelight.

179
00:10:00,149 --> 00:10:02,680
Your schedule will be less hectic for the time being,

180
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:05,350
so focus on picking out your next work, okay?

181
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:08,815
Then do I only have the signing event for tomorrow?

182
00:10:09,626 --> 00:10:12,120
That was canceled.

183
00:10:12,128 --> 00:10:13,390
Why all of a sudden?

184
00:10:13,396 --> 00:10:16,495
We had issues with the venue.

185
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:19,330
That's disappointing. I love signing.

186
00:10:19,335 --> 00:10:21,330
That's ridiculous. It's just tiring.

187
00:10:21,337 --> 00:10:23,065
This is actually better for you.

188
00:10:25,241 --> 00:10:26,965
Hello?

189
00:10:27,577 --> 00:10:31,040
Not at all. We're not looking down on you.

190
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,040
Ha Jin isn't the type that becomes pompous...

191
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:35,080
just because of fame.

192
00:10:35,084 --> 00:10:37,680
There was another reason.

193
00:10:37,687 --> 00:10:40,715
Let me take this outside.

194
00:10:40,757 --> 00:10:42,485
Hello?

195
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,020
Yes.

196
00:10:44,027 --> 00:10:45,860
- What was that? - What do you mean?

197
00:10:45,862 --> 00:10:49,090
We canceled the signing event, didn't we?

198
00:10:49,098 --> 00:10:51,430
The whole security guard thing is fishy too.

199
00:10:51,434 --> 00:10:52,860
What is it? What's going on?

200
00:10:52,869 --> 00:10:56,400
Nothing. It's true that the signing event got canceled.

201
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:58,100
Don't lie to me.

202
00:10:58,107 --> 00:11:01,375
I'm not. Why can't you believe me?

203
00:11:03,813 --> 00:11:06,075
I really hate it...

204
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:09,245
when I'm the only one in the dark.

205
00:11:11,187 --> 00:11:13,385
Tell me what's going on now.

206
00:11:18,394 --> 00:11:21,225
Anchor Lee got a threatening letter.

207
00:11:21,531 --> 00:11:23,390
A threatening letter?

208
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:25,300
I think your stalker sent him the letter.

209
00:11:25,301 --> 00:11:27,195
There were some photos.

210
00:11:27,537 --> 00:11:29,330
What about the photos?

211
00:11:29,338 --> 00:11:31,865
Do you have them now? Let me see.

212
00:11:52,328 --> 00:11:54,355
(Yeo Ha Jin)

213
00:11:55,665 --> 00:11:57,225
Hello?

214
00:11:57,433 --> 00:11:59,900
You're answering your phone right away now.

215
00:11:59,902 --> 00:12:02,500
Before, I'd call you several times, but you wouldn't answer.

216
00:12:02,505 --> 00:12:04,100
You must be busy preparing for the news,

217
00:12:04,107 --> 00:12:06,200
so I'll cut to the chase.

218
00:12:06,209 --> 00:12:07,810
Hiring security guards is the best,

219
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,110
but I'm sure you'd never go for that.

220
00:12:10,113 --> 00:12:12,010
So be careful when you go home at night.

221
00:12:12,014 --> 00:12:13,780
And don't go out by yourself.

222
00:12:13,783 --> 00:12:16,015
And make sure you always lock up.

223
00:12:16,285 --> 00:12:17,520
I'll be worried,

224
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,020
so after the news, when you get home,

225
00:12:19,021 --> 00:12:21,955
please leave me a text. Okay?

226
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:25,220
Did Ha Kyung tell you?

227
00:12:25,228 --> 00:12:28,495
She told me about the stalker and I saw the photos too.

228
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:31,360
But when I thought about it,

229
00:12:31,367 --> 00:12:34,935
you're in bigger danger than I am.

230
00:12:34,971 --> 00:12:37,070
The stalker who sent you the photos...

231
00:12:37,073 --> 00:12:40,135
is angry at you, not me.

232
00:12:40,643 --> 00:12:42,840
He cut your face in the photos.

233
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:45,575
And he sent the photos to you.

234
00:12:46,048 --> 00:12:48,045
I doubt that's the case.

235
00:12:48,451 --> 00:12:51,745
The stalker wants you and is obsessed with you.

236
00:12:53,556 --> 00:12:57,515
Now that you say it like that, it does bother me a bit.

237
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:00,390
Okay. I'll be careful.

238
00:13:00,396 --> 00:13:02,795
Then, we both should be careful.

239
00:13:02,832 --> 00:13:04,730
I have my own security team.

240
00:13:04,734 --> 00:13:07,330
And I won't be attending events that could put me in danger for now.

241
00:13:07,336 --> 00:13:09,100
So the signing event was canceled.

242
00:13:09,105 --> 00:13:11,070
In other words, don't worry about me.

243
00:13:11,073 --> 00:13:12,765
I'm glad to hear that.

244
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:15,310
And...

245
00:13:15,311 --> 00:13:16,710
if something like this happens again,

246
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:19,640
tell me that in person instead of telling Ha Kyung.

247
00:13:19,649 --> 00:13:21,050
I'm not a kid.

248
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,315
I'm somewhat professional.

249
00:13:24,287 --> 00:13:27,020
Okay. I'm sorry.

250
00:13:27,023 --> 00:13:29,520
I wasn't fishing for an apology.

251
00:13:29,525 --> 00:13:31,220
Anyway, it starts today.

252
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,655
When you get home, text me.

253
00:13:33,963 --> 00:13:35,595
Will do.

254
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,655
I am...

255
00:14:14,036 --> 00:14:16,565
madly in love.

256
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,815
(Director Ji Hyun Geun)

257
00:14:39,996 --> 00:14:41,555
Hey.

258
00:14:42,398 --> 00:14:45,130
I saw Director Ji Hyun Geun in the studio earlier.

259
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:46,360
In the studio?

260
00:14:46,369 --> 00:14:48,330
My gosh, he must think he owns this place.

261
00:14:48,337 --> 00:14:50,270
He's been all over the place with a camera.

262
00:14:50,273 --> 00:14:52,135
I wanted to give him...

263
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,340
By the way, what are you up to these days?

264
00:14:57,346 --> 00:14:58,910
I'm not up to anything.

265
00:14:58,915 --> 00:15:02,545
Yes, you are. The blue envelope.

266
00:15:04,053 --> 00:15:06,350
- I see. - I was right. There's something.

267
00:15:06,355 --> 00:15:09,290
What's in it? Why is Il Kwon going around with that envelope?

268
00:15:09,292 --> 00:15:11,760
I'm sure you were the one who gave him the assignment.

269
00:15:11,761 --> 00:15:14,085
What is it? Did someone give you a tip?

270
00:15:14,297 --> 00:15:15,960
Come to my office.

271
00:15:15,965 --> 00:15:18,565
Director Ji Hyun Geun is in my office.

272
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:20,930
What is it?

273
00:15:20,937 --> 00:15:23,070
I don't know what you mean. I'll ask Il Kwon about that.

274
00:15:23,072 --> 00:15:25,465
Director Choi wants to see me in her office.

275
00:15:29,979 --> 00:15:31,510
Come on.

276
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:33,240
They always leave me out of that.

277
00:15:33,249 --> 00:15:35,180
Great. Excellent.

278
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:37,145
Can you smile more broadly?

279
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,680
Okay. Great. That's great. All right.

280
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:42,415
All right. Smile!

281
00:15:43,092 --> 00:15:45,190
This is excellent. Yes.

282
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:48,255
It's the last one. Smile.

283
00:15:49,498 --> 00:15:50,700
Great.

284
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,330
Can you smile more broadly? A bit more.

285
00:15:52,335 --> 00:15:54,000
- Great. Nice. - Hey.

286
00:15:54,003 --> 00:15:55,370
Anchor Lee, you're here.

287
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:56,630
Come in. Come on in.

288
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,600
Can we stop now?

289
00:15:58,607 --> 00:15:59,840
Yes, I got great shots.

290
00:15:59,842 --> 00:16:01,970
These photos look amazing.

291
00:16:01,978 --> 00:16:03,670
The director has such a likable face.

292
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:05,910
I begged her to let me take photos of her.

293
00:16:05,915 --> 00:16:08,750
I thought taking her photos would inspire me.

294
00:16:08,751 --> 00:16:10,380
- I see. - By the way,

295
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:12,550
are you here to get me?

296
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:14,090
Hold on.

297
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:16,885
Look at the time.

298
00:16:16,993 --> 00:16:19,820
Time flew by when I was talking to Director Choi.

299
00:16:19,829 --> 00:16:22,790
Right. I think it'd be better if you start getting ready.

300
00:16:22,798 --> 00:16:24,360
Well, it's a live broadcast.

301
00:16:24,367 --> 00:16:26,930
So you'll be more nervous than you expected.

302
00:16:26,936 --> 00:16:29,235
I think it will be a lot of fun.

303
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:33,735
I'll get going.

304
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:36,040
I'll give you the photos as my present when I develop them.

305
00:16:36,045 --> 00:16:38,440
- I'll see you then. - Sure.

306
00:16:38,447 --> 00:16:41,045
- Good luck with the interview. - Okay. Bye.

307
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:44,620
Hey.

308
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,420
I need to talk to you. It's urgent.

309
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:47,985
Come here.

310
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:02,230
Goodness. He's such a weirdo.

311
00:17:02,238 --> 00:17:05,000
Are all artists off-the-wall like him?

312
00:17:05,007 --> 00:17:07,465
What were you doing?

313
00:17:07,843 --> 00:17:10,440
I mean, he barged into my office out of the blue.

314
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:13,010
And he bragged about himself for 10 minutes.

315
00:17:13,015 --> 00:17:14,910
He talked about his inspirations and such.

316
00:17:14,917 --> 00:17:16,580
And he started taking photos.

317
00:17:16,585 --> 00:17:18,550
I thought he'd go away if I played along.

318
00:17:18,554 --> 00:17:21,090
My gosh, but that was endless. Seriously.

319
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:22,785
Gosh.

320
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:27,190
By the way, are Director Ji and Ha Jin close?

321
00:17:27,196 --> 00:17:28,960
- Why do you ask? - He sounded...

322
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:31,200
as if he knew something. He kept sussing me out.

323
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,700
You know, about your fake relationship.

324
00:17:33,702 --> 00:17:35,530
He kept sussing me out,

325
00:17:35,538 --> 00:17:37,770
so I shut it down.

326
00:17:37,773 --> 00:17:39,835
But I don't know what he's thinking.

327
00:17:40,743 --> 00:17:42,305
Hello.

328
00:17:46,615 --> 00:17:49,315
What a great studio.

329
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,485
You're here.

330
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:54,545
You have a fine studIo.

331
00:18:00,963 --> 00:18:04,055
Isn't Ha Jin beautiful?

332
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,365
Yes, she is. She's especially pretty in my eyes.

333
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,430
You must keep a close eye on her.

334
00:18:10,439 --> 00:18:12,070
As passionate as she is,

335
00:18:12,074 --> 00:18:14,610
she's not the type to go steady with just a man.

336
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:17,240
That's why there were countless love scandals.

337
00:18:17,246 --> 00:18:20,245
Not every guy can handle a girl like her.

338
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:27,985
That's why I still can't believe it.

339
00:18:28,257 --> 00:18:32,185
Are you guys taking your relationship seriously?

340
00:18:33,295 --> 00:18:36,560
I mean, the photos I saw in the articles...

341
00:18:36,565 --> 00:18:38,995
seemed a bit awkward.

342
00:18:39,068 --> 00:18:42,535
To tell you the truth, I think you're faking it.

343
00:18:43,806 --> 00:18:46,665
Well, I'm pretty sure I'm wrong.

344
00:18:47,309 --> 00:18:49,170
We'll put on the microphones.

345
00:18:49,178 --> 00:18:50,735
Okay.

346
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:55,650
I think it's too early to talk about my next project.

347
00:18:55,651 --> 00:18:59,120
Just like the title, this film is like first love to me.

348
00:18:59,121 --> 00:19:00,890
I want to get immersed in this movie for the time being.

349
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:05,160
Did you hear him? He kept bugging you to scout for the next film.

350
00:19:05,161 --> 00:19:07,560
I see. Unfortunately, we will have to...

351
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:09,560
patiently wait for your next film.

352
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,900
- Text him and say he did well. - Thank you for coming today.

353
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:13,330
- Thank you. - Okay.

354
00:19:13,335 --> 00:19:14,730
Should I?

355
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:17,030
- That was Director Ji Hyun Geun. - Can I send this during the news?

356
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,370
What if I distract him?

357
00:19:18,374 --> 00:19:21,540
No, I meant the director. Not Anchor Lee.

358
00:19:21,544 --> 00:19:25,005
I see. You want me to text the director?

359
00:19:25,447 --> 00:19:26,640
(Director Ji)

360
00:19:26,649 --> 00:19:28,215
(Director Ji Hyun Geun)

361
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:30,675
Director Ji is calling.

362
00:19:54,877 --> 00:19:56,435
You're here.

363
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,245
Anchor Lee.

364
00:20:08,991 --> 00:20:11,855
I didn't know you were joining us.

365
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:13,560
Why didn't you tell me?

366
00:20:13,562 --> 00:20:15,090
You said you needed to talk to me.

367
00:20:15,097 --> 00:20:17,925
I just assumed that you'd know.

368
00:20:18,067 --> 00:20:19,300
That's odd.

369
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:21,270
Isn't this when couples can't wait to be with each other?

370
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:25,105
Couples text and call each other all the time in the beginning.

371
00:20:25,774 --> 00:20:28,610
Anchor Lee, do you drink?

372
00:20:28,611 --> 00:20:30,310
No. I don't.

373
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:33,875
Come on. That's no fun to hang out with a man who can't drink.

374
00:20:34,516 --> 00:20:36,445
Join us.

375
00:20:40,122 --> 00:20:41,685
Sure.

376
00:20:49,431 --> 00:20:50,995
Cheers.

377
00:20:59,808 --> 00:21:02,410
I drank it on his behalf. I'm his stand-in.

378
00:21:02,411 --> 00:21:05,240
What was that? That was rude.

379
00:21:05,247 --> 00:21:07,510
He really can't drink.

380
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,210
Please be understanding about it.

381
00:21:09,218 --> 00:21:11,345
I'll drink this instead.

382
00:21:14,089 --> 00:21:16,020
You're an awfully boring person.

383
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:18,520
Yes, I'm like that.

384
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:22,760
What? No way. He's really funny.

385
00:21:22,765 --> 00:21:26,165
You'll know if you meet him a few more times.

386
00:21:26,302 --> 00:21:28,565
Okay. All right.

387
00:21:29,505 --> 00:21:31,265
Excuse me.

388
00:21:32,074 --> 00:21:34,135
Excuse me!

389
00:21:39,081 --> 00:21:41,610
Excuse me! Is anybody here?

390
00:21:41,617 --> 00:21:43,380
What were you going to do?

391
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:46,150
- Were you really going to drink it? - We need more drinks!

392
00:21:46,155 --> 00:21:47,745
No.

393
00:21:47,923 --> 00:21:50,685
I wanted to steal your move.

394
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:59,225
This isn't a move that anyone can make.

395
00:21:59,301 --> 00:22:02,395
It's really humiliating if anyone catches you doing this.

396
00:22:23,225 --> 00:22:25,760
It seems like he's quite drunk.

397
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,960
We should break it up once he comes back.

398
00:22:27,963 --> 00:22:29,430
Can you keep a watch?

399
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:31,300
What? Keep a watch?

400
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:34,125
Let me know right away if he comes. Hurry.

401
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:40,035
Hurry up. Go.

402
00:22:43,746 --> 00:22:45,745
Why do you ask me to keep a watch?

403
00:22:47,483 --> 00:22:49,675
What are you doing?

404
00:22:56,592 --> 00:22:58,655
Are you going to steal...

405
00:22:58,861 --> 00:23:00,020
No, right?

406
00:23:00,028 --> 00:23:01,790
No. What do you think of me?

407
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,925
Keep looking out. Hurry.

408
00:23:20,349 --> 00:23:21,810
He's coming.

409
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:24,945
What do we do? Hurry. Hurry up.

410
00:23:28,357 --> 00:23:31,260
He's almost here. He's near.

411
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,055
Hurry up!

412
00:23:33,061 --> 00:23:34,630
I think I might catch his eyes.

413
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:36,660
Hurry up. He's almost here.

414
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:39,295
- He's almost here. - What are you doing? Sit down.

415
00:24:07,629 --> 00:24:09,695
They didn't bring the drink yet?

416
00:24:10,299 --> 00:24:11,500
Excuse me!

417
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:15,530
You look quite drunk. Let's go home.

418
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:17,465
Yes, Director Ji.

419
00:24:21,477 --> 00:24:24,975
Ha Jin. I need to talk alone with you.

420
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:27,280
Director Ji, you're drunk. Let's talk next time.

421
00:24:27,282 --> 00:24:30,815
No, I have to talk to you now. Come on, you and I are going out.

422
00:24:33,088 --> 00:24:34,180
Let me go.

423
00:24:34,189 --> 00:24:36,920
Let me go while I'm still nice.

424
00:24:36,925 --> 00:24:38,020
That's enough.

425
00:24:38,026 --> 00:24:41,190
No. Let me go. Let go of me!

426
00:24:41,196 --> 00:24:42,825
Let go!

427
00:24:54,977 --> 00:24:57,635
Why is he so drunk?

428
00:24:58,146 --> 00:25:00,310
Anchor Lee, you really didn't have any alcohol, did you?

429
00:25:00,315 --> 00:25:01,910
He didn't.

430
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:03,850
Then please take care of her.

431
00:25:03,852 --> 00:25:05,445
Sure.

432
00:25:05,621 --> 00:25:07,220
You know where he lives, right?

433
00:25:07,222 --> 00:25:08,290
You've been there once.

434
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:10,320
Yes, the address should be saved on the GPS.

435
00:25:10,325 --> 00:25:11,460
Drive safely.

436
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,490
Okay.

437
00:25:12,494 --> 00:25:14,725
Call me when you get there.

438
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:28,410
Why did you do that before?

439
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:31,635
You looked through his stuff and got angry at him.

440
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:34,575
Do you still meet him often?

441
00:25:34,683 --> 00:25:36,810
We met every day while we filmed the movie...

442
00:25:36,818 --> 00:25:38,750
and pretty often while we did the promotion,

443
00:25:38,754 --> 00:25:41,785
but not recently. We had no reason to meet.

444
00:25:42,224 --> 00:25:44,485
Why do you suddenly ask?

445
00:25:45,027 --> 00:25:48,060
You didn't know that he likes you?

446
00:25:48,063 --> 00:25:49,755
Me?

447
00:25:50,365 --> 00:25:52,500
Come on, no way.

448
00:25:52,501 --> 00:25:54,465
Anyone could tell.

449
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:56,700
You're pretty slow in this area.

450
00:25:56,705 --> 00:26:00,005
No way. I'm very quick-witted.

451
00:26:03,245 --> 00:26:04,875
Do you think...

452
00:26:04,913 --> 00:26:08,915
it was Director Ji who sent you those pictures?

453
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:12,780
Why would someone like him do that?

454
00:26:12,788 --> 00:26:15,490
It really isn't him. There's no way.

455
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:17,415
You never know.

456
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:21,485
People like that have no reason for doing such things.

457
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:26,125
I told you before. Don't trust people that easily.

458
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:32,565
Then what about you?

459
00:26:33,875 --> 00:26:36,075
May I trust you?

460
00:26:39,548 --> 00:26:41,205
I'm not sure.

461
00:26:41,984 --> 00:26:44,115
Don't trust me too much.

462
00:26:46,955 --> 00:26:50,015
But I'm definitely not your stalker.

463
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:03,590
Thank you for the ride.

464
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:06,065
You must be tired. You should get some rest.

465
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:07,825
Okay.

466
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:11,865
It was great to have spent some time with you today.

467
00:28:12,841 --> 00:28:16,235
I'm afraid I'll ruin everything if I tell you this now,

468
00:28:16,678 --> 00:28:18,975
but I thought I should say it.

469
00:28:19,247 --> 00:28:22,315
I'll lose my chance to tell you if I hesitate any longer.

470
00:28:23,051 --> 00:28:24,745
What is it?

471
00:28:25,187 --> 00:28:29,315
I'm saying this for the first time to you, Anchor Lee.

472
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,255
To be honest,

473
00:28:35,664 --> 00:28:38,925
my head isn't normal.

474
00:28:40,168 --> 00:28:43,665
I don't remember the things that I should remember.

475
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:46,835
There are moments when I remember something I know nothing about.

476
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:51,175
That means I'm weird. I'm not all right.

477
00:28:53,014 --> 00:28:56,475
I thought I wasn't the only one who was weird.

478
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,945
I mean, you.

479
00:29:01,523 --> 00:29:04,785
You always left me with question marks...

480
00:29:05,761 --> 00:29:09,155
from the day we first met and to this day.

481
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:14,295
Why do you want me to be happy?

482
00:29:15,337 --> 00:29:18,770
Why are you so concerned and are sensitive about me?

483
00:29:18,774 --> 00:29:21,035
But you don't even like me.

484
00:29:23,411 --> 00:29:27,105
I want to know why you're doing that.

485
00:29:27,749 --> 00:29:31,045
Does it have something to do with the things I forgot?

486
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:34,550
You know something, don't you?

487
00:29:34,556 --> 00:29:37,020
Have we always known each other?

488
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,925
Have you always known me?

489
00:29:39,494 --> 00:29:42,595
Are you a part of that time...

490
00:29:42,631 --> 00:29:44,725
which I can't recall?

491
00:29:49,404 --> 00:29:51,165
Tell me.

492
00:29:56,178 --> 00:29:58,635
I don't exactly understand...

493
00:29:59,281 --> 00:30:01,305
what you mean by that,

494
00:30:01,817 --> 00:30:04,175
but we first met at...

495
00:30:04,186 --> 00:30:06,945
the waiting room of the TV station on the day of your interview.

496
00:30:07,489 --> 00:30:09,955
And I worry about you...

497
00:30:11,193 --> 00:30:14,385
because I had a friend who got into a similar accident.

498
00:30:15,363 --> 00:30:18,525
That's why I was concerned and sensitive about you.

499
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:22,435
Does that answer your question?

500
00:30:26,441 --> 00:30:29,035
I'm sorry I suddenly brought this up.

501
00:30:30,645 --> 00:30:32,180
But since when...

502
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,845
Ha Jin!

503
00:30:36,184 --> 00:30:37,610
Hello, Anchor Lee.

504
00:30:37,619 --> 00:30:38,620
Hello.

505
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,550
Why are you suddenly here? Did something happen?

506
00:30:40,555 --> 00:30:42,090
Ha Kyung told me to come.

507
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,655
She told me not to let you be alone at home.

508
00:30:44,993 --> 00:30:47,220
That's not necessary. She'll be back soon.

509
00:30:47,229 --> 00:30:48,890
She said she'll be a little late.

510
00:30:48,897 --> 00:30:51,230
Director Ji threw up in the car, so she has to clean it up.

511
00:30:51,233 --> 00:30:52,800
It'll take a while.

512
00:30:52,801 --> 00:30:54,595
Really?

513
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,540
Go inside. Hurry.

514
00:31:07,716 --> 00:31:10,245
(Episode 10)

515
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:06,400
It looks like he's the guy who took those pictures.

516
00:32:06,408 --> 00:32:07,640
Right?

517
00:32:07,642 --> 00:32:08,870
What should we do?

518
00:32:08,877 --> 00:32:10,540
Did you report it to the police?

519
00:32:10,545 --> 00:32:12,410
Yes, they'll be here soon.

520
00:32:12,414 --> 00:32:14,345
Don't worry.

521
00:32:14,916 --> 00:32:17,510
Wasn't it too dangerous to let Anchor Lee go alone?

522
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,445
Should I go after him?

523
00:32:19,487 --> 00:32:20,620
Will you be all right?

524
00:32:20,622 --> 00:32:23,490
Yes, I'm sure it'll be better than being alone.

525
00:32:23,491 --> 00:32:25,890
Don't go anywhere, lock the doors, and stay inside.

526
00:32:25,894 --> 00:32:27,260
Okay, I'll do that.

527
00:32:27,262 --> 00:32:28,390
Be careful.

528
00:32:28,396 --> 00:32:29,955
Okay.

529
00:32:47,082 --> 00:32:48,410
Who are you?

530
00:32:48,416 --> 00:32:51,245
- Who do you think you are? - Wait!

531
00:32:53,355 --> 00:32:56,385
Mr. Lee, it's me. Reporter Park Soo Chang.

532
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:58,755
I'm with Naeil Media.

533
00:32:59,527 --> 00:33:02,495
You've seen me before, right? I'm close to Il Kwon too.

534
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,200
What? It's you, Reporter Park.

535
00:33:08,203 --> 00:33:09,765
Yes.

536
00:33:09,804 --> 00:33:11,130
Give me your camera.

537
00:33:11,139 --> 00:33:13,270
Oh, yes. I was about to erase these.

538
00:33:13,274 --> 00:33:16,710
It's not that I have any feelings against you.

539
00:33:16,711 --> 00:33:20,105
I had to take Ms. Yeo's pictures, so I ended up... Darn it.

540
00:33:20,448 --> 00:33:22,250
I can erase those myself.

541
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,875
- I have my personal pictures... - Calm down.

542
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:30,950
Send me the bill.

543
00:33:30,959 --> 00:33:32,820
I'll reimburse you.

544
00:33:32,827 --> 00:33:35,130
And don't ever let me catch you again.

545
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:37,330
If you do, I don't know what I'll do to you.

546
00:33:37,332 --> 00:33:38,900
Okay. Please excuse me.

547
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:41,095
I'm sorry about that. Sorry.

548
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:42,995
See you later.

549
00:33:44,572 --> 00:33:48,505
He always followed her around, and now he's at her house.

550
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,075
What about Ha Jin?

551
00:34:47,035 --> 00:34:48,970
What happened? Did you catch him?

552
00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:52,070
Well, it was Reporter Park Soo Chang.

553
00:34:52,073 --> 00:34:53,270
You know him, right?

554
00:34:53,274 --> 00:34:56,510
The one who released the exclusive on your love scandals.

555
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:59,005
What about Anchor Lee? Is he all right?

556
00:35:00,815 --> 00:35:02,545
Yes, Anchor Lee.

557
00:35:03,551 --> 00:35:05,850
Yes, Chul just told me.

558
00:35:05,854 --> 00:35:07,745
Where are you?

559
00:35:08,823 --> 00:35:11,015
I'm still in front of your house.

560
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,725
Hello?

561
00:35:19,334 --> 00:35:21,465
Why haven't you left?

562
00:35:23,471 --> 00:35:25,140
I was about to.

563
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:27,370
I was worried about you.

564
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:30,135
What were you going to do by running after him like that?

565
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:33,540
If he really was someone evil, could you have dealt with him?

566
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:35,875
Am I not that trustworthy?

567
00:35:36,117 --> 00:35:37,780
That's not the case.

568
00:35:37,785 --> 00:35:39,820
It's dangerous, that's why.

569
00:35:39,821 --> 00:35:41,650
Don't do that from now on.

570
00:35:41,656 --> 00:35:45,015
I'm more scared of seeing you get hurt than a stalker.

571
00:35:46,427 --> 00:35:47,860
Go inside.

572
00:35:47,862 --> 00:35:50,095
You need to go in for me to go home.

573
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:52,255
Okay.

574
00:35:53,635 --> 00:35:55,265
And...

575
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:58,435
forget about what I told you just now.

576
00:35:58,773 --> 00:36:02,070
I made it sound serious, but it's not that big of a deal.

577
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:03,610
It's not like I'm awfully ill...

578
00:36:03,611 --> 00:36:06,205
or have trouble in my day-to-day life.

579
00:36:07,015 --> 00:36:10,115
You're right. It's not a big deal.

580
00:36:11,819 --> 00:36:14,420
I can say that as the one who went through this,

581
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:18,215
but you make it sound so easy just because it's not your problem.

582
00:36:18,726 --> 00:36:21,755
Of course, you should forget about things of the past.

583
00:36:22,463 --> 00:36:24,825
Memories are...

584
00:36:24,866 --> 00:36:29,025
supposed to lose color and fade away as time goes by.

585
00:36:30,305 --> 00:36:34,105
So don't feel tormented or try hard to remember the past.

586
00:36:34,375 --> 00:36:36,605
What's important is the here and now.

587
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:40,405
Thank you...

588
00:36:41,349 --> 00:36:43,045
for many things.

589
00:36:46,154 --> 00:36:50,655
And don't let what happened to your friend get to you.

590
00:36:51,259 --> 00:36:53,690
I don't know what happened,

591
00:36:53,695 --> 00:36:55,460
but it's not your fault.

592
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,855
That stalker is the one who's bad.

593
00:36:59,901 --> 00:37:01,800
Then I'll go back in.

594
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:03,500
Go home safely.

595
00:37:03,504 --> 00:37:06,165
And text me when you get home.

596
00:37:06,608 --> 00:37:08,165
Okay.

597
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:30,695
I'm home.

598
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:03,590
You're here.

599
00:38:03,598 --> 00:38:04,960
Yes.

600
00:38:04,966 --> 00:38:06,765
Let me print it out right away.

601
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:10,770
Soo Chang just called me...

602
00:38:10,772 --> 00:38:13,205
and asked me to put in a good word for him.

603
00:38:13,274 --> 00:38:15,975
I heard you took his entire memory card.

604
00:38:16,311 --> 00:38:18,980
- Are you two close? - No, not at all.

605
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:19,980
Why?

606
00:38:19,981 --> 00:38:21,940
He's a bit of a delinquent.

607
00:38:21,949 --> 00:38:25,180
He says it's exciting and thrilling to infringe on celebrities' privacy.

608
00:38:25,186 --> 00:38:27,650
He hides in women's waiting room, in restrooms,

609
00:38:27,655 --> 00:38:30,950
and he was sued many times for breaking and entering.

610
00:38:30,958 --> 00:38:33,090
It's just that everyone dropped the suit.

611
00:38:33,094 --> 00:38:36,195
And he threatened them with the pictures he took.

612
00:38:40,768 --> 00:38:42,325
Here.

613
00:38:42,537 --> 00:38:45,195
It was really tough for me to get these.

614
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:49,010
Anyway, do you suspect that those two could be...

615
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:50,975
the one who sent those pictures?

616
00:38:52,547 --> 00:38:53,940
(Personal Information: Moon Chul)

617
00:38:53,948 --> 00:38:55,750
(3 minutes on foot)

618
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:58,010
Managers often live nearby.

619
00:38:58,019 --> 00:39:00,250
It gets too hard to drive around.

620
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:03,450
Jeong Hoon, aren't you a little too sensitive?

621
00:39:03,458 --> 00:39:04,850
The pictures came just once...

622
00:39:04,859 --> 00:39:07,055
and nothing happened ever since that time.

623
00:39:07,462 --> 00:39:10,225
Nothing happened so far.

624
00:39:10,465 --> 00:39:13,025
But what if something breaks out?

625
00:39:13,301 --> 00:39:15,565
Then it'll be too late already.

626
00:39:16,504 --> 00:39:19,635
Let me know if you need me to do anything else.

627
00:39:21,042 --> 00:39:24,205
(Moon Chul, Park Soo Chang)

628
00:39:28,216 --> 00:39:31,415
Ms. Park! What's all this?

629
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:34,580
I just brought some side dishes.

630
00:39:34,589 --> 00:39:36,290
We could've come by.

631
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:37,750
You didn't have to come all the way here.

632
00:39:37,759 --> 00:39:38,760
I'll take it.

633
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,820
Why did you bring so much stuff?

634
00:39:40,828 --> 00:39:43,030
Stop starving yourself to keep your body in shape.

635
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:45,625
You need to eat well, then work it out.

636
00:39:46,067 --> 00:39:47,730
Those are just the appetizers.

637
00:39:47,735 --> 00:39:50,035
My real business is something else.

638
00:39:51,205 --> 00:39:53,505
I came to give you this.

639
00:39:53,608 --> 00:39:54,970
A script?

640
00:39:54,976 --> 00:39:56,735
("Hello, Everyone" by Hwang So Seon)

641
00:39:57,178 --> 00:39:59,505
Is this Writer Hwang's?

642
00:39:59,947 --> 00:40:01,975
Writer Hwang So Seon?

643
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,480
No way. You're right.

644
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:09,150
I want to do this. I will. I really want to.

645
00:40:09,157 --> 00:40:11,150
You don't even know what your role is.

646
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:13,520
That doesn't matter. It's Writer Hwang.

647
00:40:13,528 --> 00:40:15,190
I want to do this no matter what.

648
00:40:15,196 --> 00:40:16,590
Tell her right now.

649
00:40:16,597 --> 00:40:18,660
What if someone else takes it?

650
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:22,670
I told them you'd do it as soon as I received the script.

651
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:26,005
No way. No way! I'm so exhilarated!

652
00:40:26,274 --> 00:40:28,540
It was my wish to work with her.

653
00:40:28,543 --> 00:40:30,540
What's her role? She's the lead actress, right?

654
00:40:30,545 --> 00:40:32,580
Of course, she is.

655
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:34,910
I got goosebumps when I read it.

656
00:40:34,916 --> 00:40:37,710
Your character is a news anchor.

657
00:40:37,718 --> 00:40:38,750
"News anchor"?

658
00:40:38,753 --> 00:40:41,515
"Hello, Viewers."

659
00:40:42,089 --> 00:40:44,090
Doesn't it seem like fate?

660
00:40:44,091 --> 00:40:46,120
Even Writer Hwang thought so.

661
00:40:46,127 --> 00:40:48,120
She said you were perfect for this role.

662
00:40:48,129 --> 00:40:49,830
- Really? - Yes.

663
00:40:49,831 --> 00:40:51,990
It suits you.

664
00:40:51,999 --> 00:40:54,530
She doesn't worry about the tone of your voice...

665
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:55,770
since Anchor Lee can teach you.

666
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:56,970
The writing and directing teams...

667
00:40:56,971 --> 00:40:58,870
would like to receive advice from him.

668
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:00,605
Is that okay?

669
00:41:01,008 --> 00:41:02,210
From Anchor Lee?

670
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:04,110
She'd like to meet him right away.

671
00:41:04,111 --> 00:41:07,240
Can you ask him when he's free?

672
00:41:07,248 --> 00:41:09,110
Does Anchor Lee need to be there?

673
00:41:09,116 --> 00:41:12,945
Yes. It'll be Writer Hwang, the director, Ha Jin, and him.

674
00:41:14,956 --> 00:41:16,520
What if he can't attend?

675
00:41:16,524 --> 00:41:18,290
You know how busy he is.

676
00:41:18,292 --> 00:41:20,420
He should still do it.

677
00:41:20,428 --> 00:41:22,020
After all, his girlfriend will be taking the lead role...

678
00:41:22,029 --> 00:41:23,190
for the first time.

679
00:41:23,197 --> 00:41:25,230
The drama is also from the same broadcasting station,

680
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:26,700
and Ha Jin's in it.

681
00:41:26,701 --> 00:41:29,670
Wouldn't it be strange to ask another news anchor...

682
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:31,895
other than him for help?

683
00:41:31,939 --> 00:41:34,670
Well, I guess.

684
00:41:34,675 --> 00:41:37,940
Don't tell me you got in a fight.

685
00:41:37,945 --> 00:41:41,480
Try to get along. This is an important period of your life.

686
00:41:41,482 --> 00:41:44,080
Don't ruin your hard-earned reputation.

687
00:41:44,085 --> 00:41:46,345
Okay?

688
00:41:46,621 --> 00:41:49,185
Hey, do you have ramyeon?

689
00:41:55,029 --> 00:41:56,625
Okay.

690
00:42:04,572 --> 00:42:07,905
What's wrong? Is the script boring?

691
00:42:15,182 --> 00:42:16,775
It's very...

692
00:42:17,018 --> 00:42:18,180
"Very"?

693
00:42:18,185 --> 00:42:19,350
Interesting.

694
00:42:19,353 --> 00:42:20,480
"Interesting"?

695
00:42:20,488 --> 00:42:23,120
It's the most interesting script I've ever read.

696
00:42:23,124 --> 00:42:25,150
I must do this. If not, I'll regret it forever.

697
00:42:25,159 --> 00:42:26,920
Okay, let's do it.

698
00:42:26,928 --> 00:42:28,790
But what about Anchor Lee?

699
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:30,730
Do you think he'll help you with your tone, give advice,

700
00:42:30,731 --> 00:42:33,200
and play a cameo role?

701
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,460
No.

702
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:36,770
"I don't like to do those things."

703
00:42:36,771 --> 00:42:37,770
I bet he'll say this.

704
00:42:37,772 --> 00:42:39,470
I thought there was romance between you two.

705
00:42:39,473 --> 00:42:41,935
There is but...

706
00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:44,370
They wouldn't remove me from the drama...

707
00:42:44,378 --> 00:42:46,110
just because he refused to give advice, right?

708
00:42:46,113 --> 00:42:49,615
That's ridiculous. Being a cast is serious business.

709
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:52,050
But do try to ask him.

710
00:42:52,053 --> 00:42:55,120
It'll be better if the director and the writer like you.

711
00:42:55,122 --> 00:42:56,120
Right.

712
00:42:56,123 --> 00:42:58,020
Yes, I bet he'll do it.

713
00:42:58,025 --> 00:42:59,920
He's been nice to me lately.

714
00:42:59,927 --> 00:43:02,625
- Really? - Yes, he'll say yes.

715
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:04,395
He probably will.

716
00:43:05,232 --> 00:43:08,125
Right? What do you think?

717
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:10,965
What do you think?

718
00:43:11,272 --> 00:43:13,135
We're here.

719
00:43:14,241 --> 00:43:16,505
Oh, my.

720
00:43:16,877 --> 00:43:20,305
You've both aged quite a bit.

721
00:43:22,049 --> 00:43:24,950
Still, let me hug you.

722
00:43:24,952 --> 00:43:28,285
Do we need to do this every time I come here?

723
00:43:28,389 --> 00:43:31,215
What do you think? It's obvious.

724
00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:38,025
Happy birthday.

725
00:43:44,338 --> 00:43:47,270
Why are you so thin? Are you sick?

726
00:43:47,274 --> 00:43:49,640
Do I look slimmer?

727
00:43:49,644 --> 00:43:53,180
That's great. I'm working out a lot these days.

728
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:54,845
Move aside, now.

729
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:58,315
- Let me give you a hug. - Hello, ma'am.

730
00:44:00,021 --> 00:44:02,245
Sorry to keep you waiting.

731
00:44:03,624 --> 00:44:05,960
Let's eat.

732
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:08,055
- Thank you for the meal. - Sure.

733
00:44:08,396 --> 00:44:11,655
I heard you're seeing someone.

734
00:44:11,866 --> 00:44:14,930
Bring her home. The sooner, the better.

735
00:44:14,935 --> 00:44:17,030
It's about time you got married.

736
00:44:17,038 --> 00:44:18,930
It's still too early for that.

737
00:44:18,939 --> 00:44:21,765
How long are you going to live like that?

738
00:44:21,876 --> 00:44:25,270
That's enough, honey. Let's eat first.

739
00:44:25,279 --> 00:44:27,740
They'll have indigestion.

740
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:28,880
Eat up.

741
00:44:28,883 --> 00:44:29,980
- Okay. - Okay.

742
00:44:29,984 --> 00:44:31,610
All right. Eat up.

743
00:44:31,619 --> 00:44:33,345
Enjoy your meal.

744
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:41,855
("Hello, Everyone" by Hwang So Seon)

745
00:44:50,371 --> 00:44:53,770
Thank you for the meal, ma'am. Your cooking skills have improved.

746
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:56,670
You really love soy sauce marinated crab, don't you?

747
00:44:56,677 --> 00:44:59,335
How could you finish three bowls of that?

748
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:02,475
Is your stomach okay?

749
00:45:03,217 --> 00:45:04,915
I need to take this.

750
00:45:12,593 --> 00:45:14,155
Hello?

751
00:45:14,495 --> 00:45:16,995
Where are you? Are you okay?

752
00:45:17,898 --> 00:45:19,630
I'm fine.

753
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:22,525
Do you have any favors you want to ask of me?

754
00:45:23,204 --> 00:45:26,235
No, I don't. Why?

755
00:45:27,441 --> 00:45:31,535
Think carefully. I'm willing to do anything.

756
00:45:32,713 --> 00:45:35,205
Do you want to ask me for a favor?

757
00:45:35,449 --> 00:45:37,015
Yes.

758
00:45:37,051 --> 00:45:38,610
What is it?

759
00:45:38,619 --> 00:45:40,420
I can't tell you just yet.

760
00:45:40,421 --> 00:45:42,420
You must do it for me.

761
00:45:42,423 --> 00:45:44,120
You can't say no.

762
00:45:44,125 --> 00:45:47,260
So think carefully.

763
00:45:47,261 --> 00:45:50,630
Who knows? You may need my help in the future.

764
00:45:50,631 --> 00:45:52,495
I'll call you again later.

765
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:54,325
Okay.

766
00:46:03,944 --> 00:46:07,810
Gosh, that was short.

767
00:46:07,815 --> 00:46:10,145
I wouldn't have minded had you talked longer.

768
00:46:11,252 --> 00:46:13,420
Tell me.

769
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:15,120
How did you two meet?

770
00:46:15,122 --> 00:46:16,750
How long has it been?

771
00:46:16,757 --> 00:46:18,020
How is she?

772
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:21,885
I saw her on TV often. How is she in real life?

773
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:25,625
Slow down.

774
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:28,430
Don't avoid my question.

775
00:46:28,435 --> 00:46:30,895
Do tell me, will you?

776
00:46:31,005 --> 00:46:32,795
It's not true.

777
00:46:33,407 --> 00:46:34,940
What do you mean?

778
00:46:34,942 --> 00:46:37,375
The articles are incorrect.

779
00:46:38,145 --> 00:46:40,505
It's complicated.

780
00:46:41,015 --> 00:46:43,810
Ha Jin's movie is being shown in theaters right now,

781
00:46:43,818 --> 00:46:46,880
so we decided to wait until they took it down.

782
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:48,645
That's all.

783
00:46:48,689 --> 00:46:50,715
We're not dating.

784
00:46:52,092 --> 00:46:53,590
I see.

785
00:46:53,594 --> 00:46:56,730
I guess this is just one of those fake dating rumors...

786
00:46:56,730 --> 00:47:00,125
that you see on TV often.

787
00:47:02,303 --> 00:47:04,765
You even fooled me.

788
00:47:10,578 --> 00:47:12,010
- Good morning. - Good morning.

789
00:47:12,012 --> 00:47:13,310
You're here early.

790
00:47:13,314 --> 00:47:15,475
- Good morning. - Hello.

791
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:17,315
All right.

792
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:22,220
- Here. - What is all this?

793
00:47:22,223 --> 00:47:25,015
I usually skip breakfast.

794
00:47:25,326 --> 00:47:28,520
You need to have breakfast if you want to be healthy.

795
00:47:28,529 --> 00:47:30,095
Here.

796
00:47:33,601 --> 00:47:34,930
I have a favor to ask.

797
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:36,470
I didn't bite it yet.

798
00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:37,900
It's not much.

799
00:47:37,905 --> 00:47:39,440
Could you be the narrator...

800
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,705
for the founding anniversary special documentary?

801
00:47:42,076 --> 00:47:44,805
- Me? - You and Ha Jin.

802
00:47:44,812 --> 00:47:46,610
Why her?

803
00:47:46,614 --> 00:47:49,250
Why do you think? You're a couple.

804
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:50,850
It's a documentary about wolves' instincts...

805
00:47:50,851 --> 00:47:52,410
and their majestic love.

806
00:47:52,419 --> 00:47:55,150
It'd be great if an actual couple narrated.

807
00:47:55,155 --> 00:47:57,020
I thought you two wouldn't last that long,

808
00:47:57,024 --> 00:47:58,690
but you're still standing strong.

809
00:47:58,692 --> 00:48:02,020
You know we're faking it. Stop trying to get us together.

810
00:48:02,029 --> 00:48:04,060
My gosh.

811
00:48:04,064 --> 00:48:06,960
Can you just do it?

812
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:10,170
The company invested hundreds of thousands of dollars.

813
00:48:10,170 --> 00:48:13,100
Let's make it interesting and add some commercials to it.

814
00:48:13,107 --> 00:48:15,740
There's no harm in getting higher ratings.

815
00:48:15,743 --> 00:48:18,110
We should give you a new nickname.

816
00:48:18,112 --> 00:48:20,445
Ratings Fairy.

817
00:48:22,049 --> 00:48:24,010
You...

818
00:48:24,018 --> 00:48:27,080
No, we need to do well.

819
00:48:27,087 --> 00:48:28,620
After what you said to Chairman Oh,

820
00:48:28,622 --> 00:48:30,885
Hwarang took back all their commercials.

821
00:48:30,958 --> 00:48:32,920
I'm not saying you were wrong.

822
00:48:32,927 --> 00:48:34,920
That's just the current situation.

823
00:48:34,929 --> 00:48:37,660
Just sound them out a bit...

824
00:48:37,665 --> 00:48:41,065
and humor them a little. Simple, right?

825
00:48:41,902 --> 00:48:44,565
You do know how much respect I have for you, right?

826
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:48,300
Yes, and I'm honored.

827
00:48:48,309 --> 00:48:50,210
So shut it and have some.

828
00:48:50,210 --> 00:48:52,175
Just do me this favor, will you?

829
00:48:53,547 --> 00:48:57,245
Okay, I'll do it. I think it'll be fun.

830
00:48:57,551 --> 00:49:00,580
You don't need to make a decision right now. You can say no too.

831
00:49:00,587 --> 00:49:02,990
No, it's okay. Remember what I said?

832
00:49:02,990 --> 00:49:06,085
I'm willing to do you any favors.

833
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:09,425
So please do me a favor as well.

834
00:49:09,697 --> 00:49:13,030
I won't misunderstand you. I don't have any ulterior motives.

835
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:15,795
I just truly want to do this drama.

836
00:49:16,003 --> 00:49:17,800
After becoming an actress,

837
00:49:17,805 --> 00:49:20,470
I auditioned for Writer Hwang every single time.

838
00:49:20,474 --> 00:49:22,835
I never got in.

839
00:49:23,677 --> 00:49:26,775
This only happens once in a blue moon.

840
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,750
Fine, but I won't be a part of it.

841
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:32,510
Okay. I'll tell them so.

842
00:49:32,519 --> 00:49:34,550
They can ask for my advice through email.

843
00:49:34,555 --> 00:49:38,050
And I'll only help you with reading the news.

844
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:40,990
That's enough. I won't take much of your time.

845
00:49:40,995 --> 00:49:44,625
All right. Let me know once the meeting is scheduled.

846
00:49:44,965 --> 00:49:46,995
Thank you!

847
00:49:47,267 --> 00:49:49,165
Hold on.

848
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:55,800
That didn't mean anything.

849
00:49:55,809 --> 00:49:58,075
I hugged you because I was happy.

850
00:49:58,312 --> 00:49:59,875
Okay.

851
00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:07,345
Hello. Good day.

852
00:50:24,138 --> 00:50:26,265
- Where is it? - Here.

853
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,205
Right here.

854
00:50:28,675 --> 00:50:30,010
It's the same envelope.

855
00:50:30,010 --> 00:50:33,075
The envelope is the same color without the sender's address.

856
00:50:39,019 --> 00:50:41,745
(Don't get the wrong idea. Ha Jin loves me.)

857
00:50:57,371 --> 00:50:58,870
Seo Yeon.

858
00:50:58,872 --> 00:51:00,640
It's snowing a lot now.

859
00:51:00,641 --> 00:51:03,170
Aren't you glad that you listened to me and took an umbrella?

860
00:51:03,177 --> 00:51:04,735
Right.

861
00:51:05,412 --> 00:51:07,810
It's snowing a lot today.

862
00:51:07,815 --> 00:51:09,375
Hello?

863
00:51:09,383 --> 00:51:11,075
Don't you know me?

864
00:51:11,819 --> 00:51:15,315
We met several times with Seo Yeon.

865
00:51:15,556 --> 00:51:16,890
Who is this?

866
00:51:16,890 --> 00:51:19,555
Who is this? Why are you answering Seo Yeon's phone?

867
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:27,265
Don't get the wrong idea.

868
00:51:29,603 --> 00:51:32,495
Seo Yeon loves me.

869
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:35,835
Not you, Jeong Hoon.

870
00:51:38,846 --> 00:51:40,405
Seo Yeon.

871
00:51:45,252 --> 00:51:47,685
I don't think Jeong Hoon believes me.

872
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:50,285
- Hello? - Right.

873
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:53,085
Seo Yeon, you should talk to him.

874
00:51:54,394 --> 00:51:55,690
Hey.

875
00:51:55,696 --> 00:51:56,960
Hold on.

876
00:51:56,964 --> 00:51:58,390
Hello?

877
00:51:58,398 --> 00:52:00,030
Don't hang up the phone.

878
00:52:00,033 --> 00:52:03,125
Seo Yeon.

879
00:52:03,137 --> 00:52:04,870
- Jeong... - Tell him.

880
00:52:04,872 --> 00:52:07,970
Tell him that you love me, not him. Isn't that right?

881
00:52:07,975 --> 00:52:10,510
- Tell him. - Seo Yeon, are you all right?

882
00:52:10,511 --> 00:52:13,135
Please...

883
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:15,805
spare me.

884
00:52:16,016 --> 00:52:18,175
Hello? Seo Yeon.

885
00:52:18,519 --> 00:52:21,520
What are you talking about, Seo Yeon? Why would I kill you?

886
00:52:21,522 --> 00:52:24,455
Don't you know that I love you so much?

887
00:52:25,425 --> 00:52:28,120
We can be happy together now.

888
00:52:28,128 --> 00:52:31,190
You love me, don't you?

889
00:52:31,198 --> 00:52:33,230
Right?

890
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:34,930
Jeong Hoon!

891
00:52:34,935 --> 00:52:37,600
Seo Yeon. Are you okay?

892
00:52:37,604 --> 00:52:40,235
- It's all right. - Seo Yeon, where are you?

893
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:42,670
Answer me, Seo Yeon.

894
00:52:42,676 --> 00:52:44,040
Hey.

895
00:52:44,044 --> 00:52:46,280
I brought a gift for you.

896
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:47,540
- Seo Yeon. - Okay?

897
00:52:47,548 --> 00:52:50,775
- Are you okay, Seo Yeon? Seo Yeon! - I made this while studying.

898
00:52:57,724 --> 00:52:59,150
Seo Yeon!

899
00:52:59,159 --> 00:53:01,590
- No! - Seo Yeon.

900
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:04,055
Are you okay, Seo Yeon? Seo Yeon!

901
00:53:04,565 --> 00:53:06,430
Jeong Hoon, save me.

902
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:08,600
- Save me, Jeong Hoon! - Where are you?

903
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:09,600
Jeong Hoon!

904
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:10,600
- Seo Yeon. - Seo Yeon!

905
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:12,700
Please get yourself together, Seo Yeon!

906
00:53:12,706 --> 00:53:14,535
- Don't do that! - You scumbag.

907
00:53:14,675 --> 00:53:16,310
If you lay a finger on her,

908
00:53:16,310 --> 00:53:18,605
I'm going to kill you! Got that?

909
00:53:19,046 --> 00:53:21,910
- Jeong Hoon. - This is all your fault.

910
00:53:21,915 --> 00:53:24,710
Seo Yeon changed all because of you.

911
00:53:24,718 --> 00:53:27,920
It's all your fault,

912
00:53:27,921 --> 00:53:29,990
Lee Jeong Hoon!

913
00:53:29,990 --> 00:53:32,685
(Seo Yeon)

914
00:53:47,507 --> 00:53:49,565
Where is she?

915
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:56,410
There you go. That's it.

916
00:53:56,416 --> 00:53:59,210
It's all right. You'll be okay.

917
00:53:59,219 --> 00:54:01,085
You're okay.

918
00:54:02,623 --> 00:54:05,555
One more step. Let's take one more step.

919
00:54:07,728 --> 00:54:10,590
Don't move. Stay still.

920
00:54:10,597 --> 00:54:13,160
Please stay still, Seo Yeon!

921
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:14,800
That's it. Good girl.

922
00:54:14,801 --> 00:54:16,425
Good.

923
00:54:24,177 --> 00:54:27,040
Seo Yeon, this will be over soon.

924
00:54:27,047 --> 00:54:28,975
Don't worry.

925
00:54:29,983 --> 00:54:32,345
Seo Yeon.

926
00:54:33,654 --> 00:54:36,050
There he is. He's here.

927
00:54:36,056 --> 00:54:38,655
He's here. He came.

928
00:54:42,062 --> 00:54:44,795
(Seo Yeon)

929
00:54:48,602 --> 00:54:50,565
Wait for me there.

930
00:56:45,552 --> 00:56:47,715
Seo Yeon.

931
00:56:51,091 --> 00:56:52,655
Seo Yeon.

932
00:56:53,059 --> 00:56:54,655
Seo Yeon.

933
00:56:55,061 --> 00:56:56,890
Seo Yeon. Are you okay?

934
00:56:56,897 --> 00:56:58,590
Stay with me, Seo Yeon!

935
00:56:58,598 --> 00:57:00,155
Seo Yeon.

936
00:57:02,102 --> 00:57:04,095
Seo Yeon, stay with me.

937
00:57:06,139 --> 00:57:07,965
Stay with me.

938
00:57:09,976 --> 00:57:11,240
Hold on.

939
00:57:11,244 --> 00:57:13,905
I'm going to call the ambulance now.

940
00:57:14,881 --> 00:57:16,745
Seo Yeon, stay with me.

941
00:57:17,384 --> 00:57:19,215
Seo Yeon.

942
00:57:19,286 --> 00:57:21,620
No. Don't. No, stay with me.

943
00:57:21,621 --> 00:57:25,155
Seo Yeon, stay with me. Please stay with me!

944
00:57:26,092 --> 00:57:27,885
I'm sorry.

945
00:57:28,161 --> 00:57:29,725
Seo Yeon.

946
00:57:32,966 --> 00:57:34,525
Seo Yeon.

947
00:57:34,601 --> 00:57:37,270
No. Please don't. No, Seo Yeon.

948
00:57:37,270 --> 00:57:38,700
Seo Yeon.

949
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:41,100
Seo Yeon, open your eyes. Seo Yeon! Open your eyes.

950
00:57:41,107 --> 00:57:42,935
Open your eyes, Seo Yeon!

951
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:50,245
Lee Jeong Hoon!

952
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,925
You came sooner than I expected.

953
00:58:45,105 --> 00:58:48,235
You jerk.

954
00:58:48,308 --> 00:58:49,670
Why did it have to be Seo Yeon?

955
00:58:49,676 --> 00:58:51,870
Why did it have to be Seo Yeon? Why?

956
00:58:51,878 --> 00:58:54,610
Why? Why?

957
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:56,710
Why her?

958
00:58:56,716 --> 00:58:58,450
Why?

959
00:58:58,451 --> 00:59:00,915
Why did it have to be Seo Yeon?

960
00:59:28,381 --> 00:59:30,345
Why would you ask me that?

961
00:59:30,417 --> 00:59:32,975
What do you mean why it had to be Seo Yeon?

962
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:35,815
It was you...

963
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:37,955
who broke us up, Lee Jeong Hoon.

964
00:59:38,191 --> 00:59:40,155
- What? - You.

965
00:59:40,627 --> 00:59:42,455
It's all right, though.

966
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:45,425
No one can come between us now.

967
00:59:45,699 --> 00:59:47,295
We will be...

968
00:59:47,567 --> 00:59:50,125
together eternally.

969
01:00:01,881 --> 01:00:03,845
Put that down!

970
01:00:06,086 --> 01:00:08,685
Let go! Let me go!

971
01:00:09,856 --> 01:00:11,615
Lee Jeong Hoon!

972
01:00:11,992 --> 01:00:15,985
Let go! Let me go!

973
01:00:18,632 --> 01:00:21,565
Lee Jeong Hoon! Lee Jeong...

974
01:00:33,546 --> 01:00:35,275
Where are you going?

975
01:01:04,344 --> 01:01:06,505
(Quarantine Treatment Room 1: Moon Seong Ho)

976
01:02:17,650 --> 01:02:20,180
(Find Me in Your Memory)

977
01:02:20,186 --> 01:02:22,250
- I caused a bit of an accident. - Like what?

978
01:02:22,255 --> 01:02:23,920
Ha Jin found out.

979
01:02:23,923 --> 01:02:26,050
If it's okay with you, may I checked the footage?

980
01:02:26,059 --> 01:02:27,090
The security footage?

981
01:02:27,093 --> 01:02:29,620
Does he always run late? Your manager, I mean.

982
01:02:29,629 --> 01:02:31,160
I always told you...

983
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:32,930
that you'll also play the lead role of my next movie, Ha Jin.

984
01:02:32,932 --> 01:02:34,430
I can't do this movie.

985
01:02:34,434 --> 01:02:35,630
I'm sorry, Director Ji.

986
01:02:35,635 --> 01:02:37,830
No, I'm telling you to read it now.

987
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:39,330
To be honest, I'm nervous...

988
01:02:39,339 --> 01:02:41,600
that things will get out of our hands.

989
01:02:41,608 --> 01:02:42,840
Don't do anything you'll regret.

990
01:02:42,842 --> 01:02:43,970
We can't do this.

991
01:02:43,977 --> 01:02:46,010
- Why not? - Because we'll regret it.

992
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:47,610
Don't blame me for this.

993
01:02:47,614 --> 01:02:50,815
It's all because of you.
