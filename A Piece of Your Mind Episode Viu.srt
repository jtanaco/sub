1
00:00:30,577 --> 00:00:34,517
You are a conversation device with Ha Won's character and emotions.

2
00:00:34,517 --> 00:00:36,887
What will make this machine you?

3
00:00:36,986 --> 00:00:39,926
Four o'clock in the afternoon. Norway. Dark afternoons.

4
00:00:39,926 --> 00:00:41,496
Ji Soo used to get scared.

5
00:00:41,926 --> 00:00:44,797
Excuse me. Who are you? What are you doing in there?

6
00:00:44,797 --> 00:00:45,996
Did the sun rise already?

7
00:00:46,597 --> 00:00:48,196
What do you mean you bought a recording studio?

8
00:00:48,196 --> 00:00:50,196
It's the best place to collect voices.

9
00:00:50,196 --> 00:00:51,707
I want to run tests there on one more person.

10
00:00:51,707 --> 00:00:53,307
He must be Before Dawn.

11
00:00:54,007 --> 00:00:55,707
My life is filled with odd things these days.

12
00:00:55,707 --> 00:00:57,847
People I didn't know suddenly appear...

13
00:00:57,847 --> 00:01:00,347
Record Kim Ji Soo saying a few things.

14
00:01:00,506 --> 00:01:02,877
What is your relationship with Kim Ji Soo?

15
00:01:02,877 --> 00:01:04,076
We're kids who are like islands.

16
00:01:04,076 --> 00:01:05,087
Who are you?

17
00:01:05,087 --> 00:01:06,517
Why do you need her stupid voice?

18
00:01:06,517 --> 00:01:07,816
Her voice is enough.

19
00:01:07,816 --> 00:01:10,816
I only want a small piece of her.

20
00:01:10,926 --> 00:01:13,326
Do you understand wanting a recording of someone's voice...

21
00:01:13,326 --> 00:01:14,396
because you miss them?

22
00:01:14,396 --> 00:01:17,227
Whether you cherish a photograph or a voice recording,

23
00:01:17,227 --> 00:01:18,926
I think it's the same.

24
00:01:18,926 --> 00:01:21,036
Should I have the two of them meet?

25
00:01:21,036 --> 00:01:22,066
It's Ha Won, isn't it?

26
00:01:22,066 --> 00:01:24,337
I can't see him.

27
00:01:24,337 --> 00:01:25,337
(Previously on "A Piece of Your Mind")

28
00:01:26,506 --> 00:01:29,037
I feel so bad for that guy Ha Won.

29
00:01:29,037 --> 00:01:32,246
How do you think he endured 10 years?

30
00:01:32,246 --> 00:01:35,777
I think it would be possible if she were the center of his life.

31
00:01:36,117 --> 00:01:38,746
I'll listen to everything you want to say.

32
00:01:39,417 --> 00:01:42,656
My husband... He made a mistake.

33
00:01:42,787 --> 00:01:45,326
How many times must I tell you that it makes me miserable...

34
00:01:45,326 --> 00:01:47,387
and that it's too hard for me?

35
00:01:47,996 --> 00:01:49,557
It's your problem now.

36
00:01:51,096 --> 00:01:53,326
Won's mother, whom I miss.

37
00:01:53,966 --> 00:01:55,436
May I...

38
00:01:55,936 --> 00:01:58,037
apologize on his behalf?

39
00:01:59,067 --> 00:02:01,876
Hello? Ji Soo?

40
00:02:02,477 --> 00:02:03,876
What's wrong?

41
00:02:03,876 --> 00:02:06,106
It snowed too much.

42
00:02:08,246 --> 00:02:11,287
Hang on. Ji Soo.

43
00:02:11,787 --> 00:02:13,686
Hello? Ji Soo.

44
00:02:18,087 --> 00:02:19,557
I'm scared.

45
00:02:23,296 --> 00:02:26,326
I'll stop waiting.

46
00:02:45,687 --> 00:02:46,787
(Episode 3)

47
00:02:47,247 --> 00:02:49,016
You haven't been here in a while...

48
00:03:06,507 --> 00:03:09,076
A single leaf

49
00:03:09,076 --> 00:03:11,276
Lands on the shoulder

50
00:03:21,616 --> 00:03:24,217
If you wanted to buy the dishes, you should've bought them yourself.

51
00:03:24,257 --> 00:03:25,326
Why did you make me do it?

52
00:03:25,326 --> 00:03:27,727
Why did you drag me into your people's business...

53
00:03:28,197 --> 00:03:30,556
I can't sleep at night. It was...

54
00:03:30,556 --> 00:03:33,766
It was so hard to get over, and now... Why...

55
00:03:33,766 --> 00:03:35,467
Why are you doing this to me?

56
00:03:36,497 --> 00:03:38,937
I hear her voice every night.

57
00:03:41,576 --> 00:03:43,877
She was shaking in fear, saying she was scared.

58
00:03:44,007 --> 00:03:45,646
I couldn't do anything for her.

59
00:03:45,676 --> 00:03:48,016
I couldn't do anything but listen to her.

60
00:03:48,016 --> 00:03:49,747
You have no idea what it's like!

61
00:03:52,217 --> 00:03:53,787
Take some time off.

62
00:03:53,887 --> 00:03:55,257
Did Ha Won say to come back?

63
00:03:55,257 --> 00:03:58,526
To do what this time? What does he want to drag me into this time?

64
00:03:58,526 --> 00:04:01,497
Seo Woo, don't do this.

65
00:04:02,296 --> 00:04:04,766
I'm sorry for dragging you into this.

66
00:04:04,826 --> 00:04:06,097
But...

67
00:04:06,497 --> 00:04:09,037
please don't blame my uncle.

68
00:04:09,396 --> 00:04:12,437
If you're this upset, imagine how he feels.

69
00:04:17,076 --> 00:04:18,106
Where is he?

70
00:04:18,106 --> 00:04:19,806
How would I know?

71
00:04:20,847 --> 00:04:22,247
I don't know.

72
00:04:22,576 --> 00:04:24,016
I mean it.

73
00:04:24,887 --> 00:04:26,516
He's nowhere to be found.

74
00:05:01,387 --> 00:05:03,156
(77-30 Wokin 4-gil, Old: 47-341 Wokin-dong, Jongno-gu)

75
00:06:00,507 --> 00:06:02,247
Should I leave the box here?

76
00:06:06,646 --> 00:06:08,857
(To Moon Soon Ho)

77
00:06:09,016 --> 00:06:10,257

(From Kim Ji Soo)

79
00:06:47,726 --> 00:06:49,497
I shouldn't have left it there.

80
00:06:51,726 --> 00:06:53,726
If he sees it, he'll be heartbroken.

81
00:06:53,726 --> 00:06:57,297
(From Kim Ji Soo)

82
00:07:06,507 --> 00:07:07,846
I can feel his pain.

83
00:07:25,627 --> 00:07:29,266
(A Piece of Your Mind)

00:08:05,206 --> 00:08:07,536
(Han Seo Woo)

85
00:08:11,137 --> 00:08:12,247
What is he doing?

86
00:08:12,677 --> 00:08:14,646
He doesn't know my password.

87
00:09:05,526 --> 00:09:06,827
I'm at the studio right now.

88
00:09:07,367 --> 00:09:09,997
Kim Ji Soo's voice recording hasn't arrived yet.

89
00:09:10,637 --> 00:09:14,036
If you tell me the password, I'll download the file and leave.

90
00:09:15,207 --> 00:09:16,837
Give it up, Ha Won.

(This folder is empty.)

94
00:09:43,436 --> 00:09:46,737
I've deleted her voice recordings from the computer.

96

(Your mail has been sent.)

97
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:15,367
Yes, Mother.

98
00:10:19,867 --> 00:10:21,306
I left it all there.

99
00:10:23,607 --> 00:10:24,676
Since Ji Soo...

100
00:10:31,176 --> 00:10:32,646
liked Norway.

101
00:10:45,526 --> 00:10:46,727
What are you doing?

102
00:10:47,097 --> 00:10:48,666
I couldn't wake you because you were asleep.

103
00:10:49,536 --> 00:10:51,296
What? I wasn't sleeping.

104
00:10:51,396 --> 00:10:52,566
You were asleep.

105
00:10:54,806 --> 00:10:57,607
What are you doing? Don't touch my computer.

106
00:10:59,247 --> 00:11:00,406
Do we continue or not?

107
00:11:01,816 --> 00:11:04,176
- Continue. - No. I said no.

108
00:11:04,347 --> 00:11:06,617
I believe this is the studio's computer.

109
00:11:06,987 --> 00:11:08,217
I used it most of the time.

110
00:11:08,217 --> 00:11:09,916
I rented it for the whole day today.

111
00:11:11,757 --> 00:11:12,857
Please leave.

112
00:11:38,117 --> 00:11:40,916
He's asking whether to delete the restored voice files or not.

113
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:41,987
Delete them.

114
00:11:42,987 --> 00:11:44,056
Okay.

115
00:11:47,686 --> 00:11:49,497
It was for everyone.

116
00:11:53,467 --> 00:11:55,097
Tell Ha Won...

117
00:11:56,737 --> 00:11:57,997
that Ji Soo is dead,

118
00:11:57,997 --> 00:12:00,337
and to stop obsessing over her with her stupid voice.

119
00:12:00,536 --> 00:12:02,837
That doing that won't bring her back,

120
00:12:04,377 --> 00:12:06,477
and to stop this horrifying behavior.

121
00:12:11,117 --> 00:12:12,316
I'll tell him.

122
00:12:26,426 --> 00:12:27,526
My bag.

123
00:12:50,217 --> 00:12:51,587
This is different from what you said.

124
00:12:53,426 --> 00:12:54,487
You said you'd watch him...

125
00:12:55,656 --> 00:12:56,957
with pity from afar.

126
00:12:57,426 --> 00:12:59,727
I just want to see him from afar.

127
00:13:00,227 --> 00:13:02,036
I want to see his face from afar.

128
00:13:02,766 --> 00:13:04,896
- Why from afar? - If I'm too close,

129
00:13:04,896 --> 00:13:07,036
he'll see that I pity him.

130
00:13:09,577 --> 00:13:10,806
He'll see that look on my face.

131
00:13:16,276 --> 00:13:17,877
I'm watching him with pity.

132
00:13:25,727 --> 00:13:26,857
Goodbye.

133
00:13:28,186 --> 00:13:29,257
Ha Won.

134
00:13:32,097 --> 00:13:33,166
Good day.

135
00:13:48,007 --> 00:13:49,176
We need to talk.

136
00:13:51,786 --> 00:13:54,446
Was it Kim Ji Soo whom you said you'd do a test on?

137
00:13:59,257 --> 00:14:01,926
- I'll do it. - On someone dead...

138
00:14:01,926 --> 00:14:04,727
without her permission, not to mention her guardian's?

139
00:14:05,566 --> 00:14:06,997
- Why? - For no reason.

140
00:14:06,997 --> 00:14:08,467
I just need to do something.

141
00:14:08,967 --> 00:14:10,097
I'm doing it for me.

142
00:14:14,237 --> 00:14:16,507
- Nothing bad will happen. - It had better not.

143
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:19,176
Look at you. Do you have insomnia again?

144
00:14:20,406 --> 00:14:22,077
No. I slept...

145
00:14:23,077 --> 00:14:24,176
for a while earlier.

146
00:14:42,997 --> 00:14:46,337
I've deleted her voice recordings from the computer.

147
00:15:43,248 --> 00:15:45,388
What's the occasion? Who were you with all night?

148
00:15:45,388 --> 00:15:47,289
That's not it. I fell asleep in the studio.

149
00:15:47,949 --> 00:15:49,488
That crazy...

150
00:15:49,858 --> 00:15:52,829
Why would you sleep there? Couldn't you call?

151
00:15:52,858 --> 00:15:54,429
See you later.

152
00:16:09,378 --> 00:16:11,849
You didn't come home after saying you were so gloomy and anxious.

153
00:16:11,849 --> 00:16:13,349
Didn't you think we'd be worried?

154
00:16:13,349 --> 00:16:15,748
We were worried sick about you all night.

155
00:16:15,748 --> 00:16:17,118
Sorry.

156
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,148
- I'm hungry. - See you later.

157
00:16:20,289 --> 00:16:21,789
Have a nice day.

158
00:16:23,118 --> 00:16:24,959
Goodness, gracious.

159
00:16:35,638 --> 00:16:37,968
- Goodness. - I forgot.

160
00:16:37,968 --> 00:16:40,408
- Do it yourself. - Why are you suddenly...

161
00:16:41,069 --> 00:16:43,309
- Did you forget your charger? - Yes.

162
00:16:46,549 --> 00:16:48,208
Chang Sup, I'll do it for you.

163
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,319
Okay.

164
00:16:53,549 --> 00:16:54,618
Do you know how to do it?

165
00:16:54,618 --> 00:16:57,789
Of course, I did this for my dad every morning.

166
00:17:01,128 --> 00:17:04,858
Seo Woo, I'm going to the market. Clean up when you're done.

167
00:17:08,468 --> 00:17:09,868
I'm done. Let's go.

168
00:17:09,868 --> 00:17:12,069
Go ahead. I need to talk to her.

169
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:13,208
Okay, see you.

170
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:17,438
Talk about what? Silly.

171
00:17:17,438 --> 00:17:18,809
After I count to five.

172
00:17:19,378 --> 00:17:20,378
One...

173
00:17:20,378 --> 00:17:22,549
Just tell her first before you get caught.

174
00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:24,918
It's nothing shocking Why are you dating in secret?

175
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:26,989
Because that's what Eun Joo wanted.

176
00:17:26,989 --> 00:17:28,349
As if that's true.

177
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:31,188
Not everyone dates the same way. It's different person by person.

178
00:17:31,188 --> 00:17:33,188
Just like how everyone looks different.

179
00:17:33,188 --> 00:17:36,128
We have our own way of dating.

180
00:17:36,229 --> 00:17:37,458
Why should we follow others?

181
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:39,628
You're dating in secret, but you talk big.

182
00:17:41,569 --> 00:17:42,799
Three, four, five.

183
00:17:55,479 --> 00:17:57,878
A single leaf

184
00:17:59,148 --> 00:18:01,618
Lands on the shoulder

185
00:18:03,019 --> 00:18:04,688
Without making

186
00:18:05,289 --> 00:18:06,358
A sound

187
00:18:06,358 --> 00:18:08,229
Cosmos laid

188
00:18:09,158 --> 00:18:10,958
Its hand on me

189
00:18:13,198 --> 00:18:14,569
It was very

190
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:29,448
Eun Joo.

191
00:18:32,349 --> 00:18:34,388
If you...

192
00:18:35,019 --> 00:18:38,958
didn't stay in touch, meet, or even think of meeting...

193
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:41,188
for 10 long years,

194
00:18:41,858 --> 00:18:44,099
and were like strangers all that time,

195
00:18:46,168 --> 00:18:47,928
can you be sadder...

196
00:18:48,569 --> 00:18:52,168
than someone who spent 10 years with that person?

197
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,378
Is there someone like that?

198
00:18:55,438 --> 00:18:56,608
Yes.

199
00:18:57,608 --> 00:18:58,779
There is.

200
00:18:59,809 --> 00:19:01,349
That's rare.

201
00:19:02,019 --> 00:19:03,349
Very rare.

202
00:19:06,749 --> 00:19:08,688
Gosh, it's hot.

203
00:19:21,398 --> 00:19:22,569
Mr. Kang.

204
00:19:23,668 --> 00:19:25,138
Is the studio empty?

205
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:26,539
Yes.

206
00:19:26,539 --> 00:19:28,569
Let me use it just for 10 minutes.

207
00:19:55,938 --> 00:19:57,239
If I could apologize...

208
00:19:57,239 --> 00:19:58,368
To whom?

209
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,608
What if I could apologize to Won?

210
00:20:00,608 --> 00:20:02,708
- I can call... - It's nothing to apologize for.

211
00:20:06,948 --> 00:20:09,378
- Gosh, I'm sorry. - It's okay.

212
00:20:11,448 --> 00:20:13,349
Are you Korean?

213
00:20:13,549 --> 00:20:16,688
You didn't answer, so I didn't think you were.

214
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:18,349
That was nice.

215
00:21:19,349 --> 00:21:20,789
You didn't hear anything.

216
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:29,658
What was that?

217
00:21:29,999 --> 00:21:32,128
I think I just heard something.

218
00:21:57,059 --> 00:21:59,358
Can I upload this on my social media page?

219
00:21:59,729 --> 00:22:00,928
Sure.

220
00:22:15,239 --> 00:22:16,739
Isn't this that challenge?

221
00:22:16,739 --> 00:22:19,608
If you're tagged, you have to post seven black and white photos...

222
00:22:19,849 --> 00:22:21,378
of your daily life without a description.

223
00:22:21,608 --> 00:22:23,079
Were you tagged?

224
00:22:23,118 --> 00:22:24,249
Is that it?

225
00:22:32,529 --> 00:22:35,188
The last traces of Ji Soo's daily life.

226
00:22:52,138 --> 00:22:53,549
Where is this?

227
00:22:58,718 --> 00:22:59,989
Is it in Seoul?

228
00:23:18,099 --> 00:23:19,269
This place is...

229
00:24:28,809 --> 00:24:29,979
It's Ha Won.

230
00:24:50,128 --> 00:24:53,398
(Eunjoo Homestay)

231
00:24:56,999 --> 00:25:00,509
I hear Hyung Suk is working at AH now.

232
00:25:00,638 --> 00:25:02,039
That's good.

233
00:25:04,438 --> 00:25:05,779
All our alumni are...

234
00:25:06,549 --> 00:25:08,779
successful except for us.

235
00:25:12,118 --> 00:25:15,648
He gets to work with top experts like Moon Ha Won and Kim Hoon.

236
00:25:15,648 --> 00:25:19,029
As if. I heard it's almost impossible to even see their faces.

237
00:25:19,029 --> 00:25:21,829
It's said they have a secret lab in a forest.

238
00:25:21,829 --> 00:25:22,958
Isn't that so cool?

239
00:25:22,958 --> 00:25:25,799
I hear that's all a lie. No one knows...

240
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:27,428
what they're doing.

241
00:25:30,938 --> 00:25:32,668
I wanted to eat dried radish leaf soup.

242
00:25:32,668 --> 00:25:33,968
How refreshing.

243
00:25:36,739 --> 00:25:39,208
Where in the world is Uncle?

244
00:25:39,979 --> 00:25:41,979
What if he sitting in front of a stranger's house,

245
00:25:41,979 --> 00:25:43,678
starving for four days...

246
00:25:44,378 --> 00:25:46,218
Hey, Ha Won.

247
00:25:46,789 --> 00:25:47,789
Why weren't you answering your phone?

248
00:25:47,789 --> 00:25:50,289
Where were you all this time? I was...

249
00:25:50,718 --> 00:25:52,188
so worried.

250
00:25:52,829 --> 00:25:53,928
Seriously.

251
00:25:56,499 --> 00:25:58,858
What's this? There's nothing to eat.

252
00:26:00,069 --> 00:26:01,198
Check the freezer.

253
00:26:04,239 --> 00:26:05,468
You have only bagels.

254
00:26:07,908 --> 00:26:09,039
I'm fine.

255
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:11,208
That's all I need.

256
00:26:19,249 --> 00:26:21,249
We got the MMI-related design.

257
00:26:21,249 --> 00:26:22,559
It's not the final version.

258
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:25,858
We're cross-checking it now as per Stephan's instructions.

259
00:26:26,289 --> 00:26:28,128
Do you want some help with that?

260
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:29,198
That would be great.

261
00:26:31,658 --> 00:26:34,099
I'll send you the file. Thanks.

262
00:26:39,408 --> 00:26:40,968
Did you find Kim Ji Soo?

263
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:45,608
- No. - If you keep talking to it,

264
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:48,408
you'll find the point of reaction at some point.

265
00:26:48,749 --> 00:26:52,249
You'll want to know whether you're at that point of reaction.

266
00:26:52,589 --> 00:26:53,648
No.

267
00:26:54,948 --> 00:26:56,559
That's just a subsequent matter.

268
00:26:57,858 --> 00:26:59,358
I just want to hear anything spoken in her voice.

269
00:27:07,428 --> 00:27:08,868
Throw that away.

270
00:27:09,968 --> 00:27:11,099
You're home early.

271
00:27:11,698 --> 00:27:14,408
Why would I throw this out? It's perfectly fine.

272
00:27:14,638 --> 00:27:15,839
You're so ghetto.

273
00:27:17,608 --> 00:27:19,039
I'll just buy one and donate it to you.

274
00:27:20,648 --> 00:27:23,049
Did you remember that it's your mom's birthday today?

275
00:27:23,819 --> 00:27:25,479
- Darn it. - You brat.

276
00:27:25,678 --> 00:27:27,188
Call her now.

277
00:27:27,688 --> 00:27:29,718
How do you remember all of that?

278
00:27:30,158 --> 00:27:32,358
I just remember it all.

279
00:27:33,289 --> 00:27:35,358
I can't help that I remember.

280
00:27:35,999 --> 00:27:38,329
It's probably because you love me so much.

281
00:27:38,329 --> 00:27:41,269
Stop that. I get paid to do this.

282
00:27:41,968 --> 00:27:44,499
- It's cold. Go in. - Okay.

283
00:27:45,638 --> 00:27:48,208
Leave your blazer. I'll iron it.

284
00:27:49,108 --> 00:27:52,178
You worked so hard to get that job. Don't dress so sloppy.

285
00:27:53,009 --> 00:27:55,408
You shouldn't look so sloppy.

286
00:27:55,509 --> 00:27:56,648
You'll make your parents look bad.

287
00:27:56,648 --> 00:27:58,319
Mom.

288
00:27:58,618 --> 00:28:00,519
Happy birthday. Of course,

289
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:02,489
I remembered.

290
00:28:05,019 --> 00:28:08,158
You can't look sloppy. You can't make your parents look bad.

291

(Choi Soo Ji)

292
00:28:23,479 --> 00:28:25,208
Thanks, Eun Joo.

293
00:28:29,579 --> 00:28:30,678
Did you drink?

294
00:28:33,948 --> 00:28:35,589
Hey. Where are you going?

295
00:28:38,718 --> 00:28:40,729
Eun Joo's going to kill him.

296
00:28:47,529 --> 00:28:48,668
Why that...

297
00:29:00,448 --> 00:29:01,979
(Nonghyup Bank)

298
00:29:03,148 --> 00:29:04,178
Hey.

299
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:06,789
Take it.

300
00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:09,259
Take it already.

301
00:29:09,259 --> 00:29:11,819
I carried it like this on the bus so it wouldn't get wrinkled.

302
00:29:11,819 --> 00:29:12,858
Take it.

303
00:29:14,128 --> 00:29:17,059
Moron. After all the abuse you put up with...

304
00:29:17,858 --> 00:29:19,229
Eun Joo looked distraught...

305
00:29:19,229 --> 00:29:21,198
that you left your uniform.

306
00:29:23,769 --> 00:29:25,868
Do you know what it means when she makes dried pollack soup?

307
00:29:26,309 --> 00:29:27,839
Do you know the truth behind it?

308
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:30,408
She always makes it if Chang Sup drinks.

309
00:29:30,979 --> 00:29:32,608
Are you mad that she changed the menu?

310
00:29:33,678 --> 00:29:35,279
You're so pathetic.

311
00:29:36,819 --> 00:29:38,979
- They had a reason. - Did you know?

312
00:29:40,249 --> 00:29:42,188
Are Chang Sup and Eun Joo really...

313
00:29:42,188 --> 00:29:44,118
Let them be. Play dumb.

314
00:29:44,688 --> 00:29:45,989
It hasn't been that long.

315
00:29:47,789 --> 00:29:49,329
I feel so betrayed.

316
00:30:18,458 --> 00:30:22,589
They connected AI, big data, DNA, and medical science...

317
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:25,799
to create "network medicine".

318
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:29,739
Network medicine...

319
00:30:29,739 --> 00:30:32,599
is a program that remembers each individual's medical history...

320
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:34,309
and classifies them...

321
00:30:34,309 --> 00:30:36,138
according to psychological patterns to diagnose them.

322
00:30:37,608 --> 00:30:38,608
Kim Hoon?

323
00:30:38,938 --> 00:30:41,178
It provides complete confidentiality...

324
00:30:41,178 --> 00:30:44,148
and uses big data to evaluate...

325
00:30:44,148 --> 00:30:46,118
I wonder what he does for a living.

326
00:30:46,349 --> 00:30:47,718
This is a flowchart.

327
00:30:47,718 --> 00:30:49,458
Record Kim Ji Soo saying a few things.

328
00:30:49,489 --> 00:30:51,858
Do you understand wanting a recording of someone's voice...

329
00:30:51,918 --> 00:30:52,928
because you miss them?

330
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:55,529
Whether you cherish a photograph or a voice recording,

331
00:30:55,858 --> 00:30:57,059
I think it's the same.

332
00:30:57,059 --> 00:30:58,099
Her voice.

333
00:30:58,858 --> 00:31:00,329
Personal history.

334
00:31:00,999 --> 00:31:03,398
And Ha Won may be Moon Ha Won.

335
00:31:03,398 --> 00:31:05,739
This isn't just a simple recording.

336
00:31:06,208 --> 00:31:08,438
- Who are you? - Introduce yourself first.

337
00:31:09,168 --> 00:31:10,638
Then I'll explain the relationship.

338
00:31:11,138 --> 00:31:12,178
Where...

339
00:31:12,779 --> 00:31:13,979
are you right now?

340
00:31:15,108 --> 00:31:16,378
- Look for me. - Look for me.

341
00:32:02,829 --> 00:32:03,958
Are you going to the studio?

342
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,029
That's what this is, right?

343
00:32:06,398 --> 00:32:08,029
That's what this is, isn't it?

344
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:13,408
It was you, Ha Won, at the farm who told me to look for you.

345
00:32:13,638 --> 00:32:15,468
But Ha Won wasn't there. He wasn't,

346
00:32:15,468 --> 00:32:18,279
but I conversed with Ha Won's words and voice.

347
00:32:18,908 --> 00:32:20,408
How is that possible?

348
00:32:21,608 --> 00:32:22,948
Because you're Moon Ha Won.

349
00:32:24,718 --> 00:32:27,319
That's why you needed Ji soo's voice, isn't it?

350
00:32:32,388 --> 00:32:33,428
Taxi.

351
00:32:54,408 --> 00:32:55,448
It's me.

352
00:32:57,749 --> 00:32:59,118
How have you been?

353
00:33:02,148 --> 00:33:03,688
You know that cafe, right?

354
00:33:04,089 --> 00:33:05,458
I left a flower there.

355
00:33:05,688 --> 00:33:08,688
I am well. I will look into the cafe.

356
00:33:09,158 --> 00:33:10,698
It's just Ji Soo's voice.

357
00:33:11,628 --> 00:33:13,668
The function is a conversation service that we know.

358
00:33:14,599 --> 00:33:17,799
You converted Ji Soo's life into data...

359
00:33:18,368 --> 00:33:20,039
and overlaid her voice on top of it.

360
00:33:21,438 --> 00:33:22,569
What were you imagining?

361
00:33:22,739 --> 00:33:24,608
A conversation with the real Ji Soo.

362
00:33:32,349 --> 00:33:33,388
What?

363
00:33:33,618 --> 00:33:37,189
I thought maybe you had some surveillance equipment.

364
00:33:38,158 --> 00:33:40,559
- I don't even have heat here. - Isn't it cold?

365
00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:43,599
- It is. - But you're living here anyway?

366
00:33:44,798 --> 00:33:46,059
It's so cold.

367
00:33:48,129 --> 00:33:49,468
I should buy a stove.

368
00:33:49,638 --> 00:33:51,599
You can just have the city turn on the gas.

369
00:33:52,368 --> 00:33:53,769
They'll come right away if you call them.

370
00:33:55,468 --> 00:33:56,479
I'll do that.

371
00:34:00,849 --> 00:34:02,109
It's the safest here.

372
00:34:02,879 --> 00:34:04,048
No one knows about this place.

373
00:34:19,669 --> 00:34:21,698
Can you tell me about when you saw her last?

374
00:34:24,669 --> 00:34:28,068
She came to the studio before she went to the airport.

375
00:34:29,209 --> 00:34:30,879
She yelled at me...

376
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:33,349
that day you two didn't meet.

377
00:34:33,479 --> 00:34:34,879
She must have felt bad.

378
00:34:35,178 --> 00:34:36,948
Ji Soo would never yell.

379
00:34:36,948 --> 00:34:39,618
I don't mean she cursed or raised her voice.

380
00:34:39,948 --> 00:34:42,349
She spoke at a higher tone than usual.

381
00:34:43,258 --> 00:34:44,859
You know this is hard for me to talk about.

382
00:34:49,899 --> 00:34:51,959
I heard you were the last person to speak to her.

383
00:34:53,468 --> 00:34:55,468
- Well... - I'm scared.

384
00:35:01,309 --> 00:35:02,508
Do you want something to drink?

385
00:35:05,778 --> 00:35:07,579
All I have are water and coffee.

386
00:35:10,479 --> 00:35:12,419
How do you live on that?

387
00:35:12,948 --> 00:35:15,118
You need to eat well when things are hard.

388
00:35:15,118 --> 00:35:16,218
It's too hard otherwise.

389
00:35:20,229 --> 00:35:21,229
If...

390
00:35:23,198 --> 00:35:25,599
we had met thanks to you,

391
00:35:29,399 --> 00:35:30,968
what do you think she would've said to me?

392
00:35:42,678 --> 00:35:43,919
If...

393
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:48,189
I mean, I know it's pointless to talk about ifs, but if by chance,

394
00:35:48,388 --> 00:35:51,218
you had met because of my nosiness,

395
00:35:54,359 --> 00:35:56,658
maybe she would've told you everything eating her up inside...

396
00:35:57,028 --> 00:35:59,729
and felt the burden lifted, and not gone to Norway.

397
00:36:10,338 --> 00:36:11,778
About her dishes.

398
00:36:13,109 --> 00:36:15,249
Whether you like them,

399
00:36:15,349 --> 00:36:18,749
what you use them for, how good the food tastes out of them...

400
00:36:19,379 --> 00:36:23,059
Maybe she would've bragged about how pretty they were.

401
00:36:23,758 --> 00:36:25,559
Maybe...

402
00:36:26,158 --> 00:36:29,229
she would've asked why you chose Seo Woo of all people to buy them...

403
00:36:29,559 --> 00:36:32,028
and complimented you on having a good eye for people.

404
00:36:38,968 --> 00:36:40,638
I should use them well.

405
00:36:46,278 --> 00:36:48,609
She called me from Norway...

406
00:36:49,379 --> 00:36:51,448
and said she was glad she went.

407
00:36:53,218 --> 00:36:55,349
That being there, she wondered why she lived like that,

408
00:36:55,349 --> 00:36:57,588
and that it felt cathartic.

409
00:36:58,959 --> 00:37:00,258
She said...

410
00:37:01,158 --> 00:37:03,798
it was a path you and she used to take together.

411
00:37:07,669 --> 00:37:09,738
- Na. - Nya.

412
00:37:09,868 --> 00:37:11,899
- Neo. - Nyeo.

413
00:37:11,939 --> 00:37:13,968
- No. - Nyo.

414
00:37:13,968 --> 00:37:15,109
Noo.

415
00:37:15,468 --> 00:37:17,838
- Ga. - Gya.

416
00:37:18,039 --> 00:37:20,448
- Geo. - Gyeo.

417
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:22,749
- Go. - Gyo.

418
00:37:30,859 --> 00:37:32,888
She said it was so nice,

419
00:37:33,019 --> 00:37:34,959
and that she was so happy,

420
00:37:35,859 --> 00:37:38,999
and that she thought she could be strong now.

421
00:37:48,568 --> 00:37:50,008
Ji Soo.

422
00:37:51,278 --> 00:37:53,379
I'll just tell him that much.

423
00:38:09,129 --> 00:38:10,928
What's with the weather?

424
00:38:11,229 --> 00:38:13,769
It's dark, like it's nighttime.

425
00:38:13,769 --> 00:38:16,028
Today, it will be cloudy...

426
00:38:16,028 --> 00:38:18,698
and rain is expected.

427
00:38:23,209 --> 00:38:24,609
Ji Soo.

428
00:38:24,838 --> 00:38:28,349
Yes, I'm Kim Ji Soo. Please ask your question.

429
00:38:34,548 --> 00:38:36,088
Do you want to borrow it?

430
00:38:38,859 --> 00:38:41,059
I can change the voice if it freaks you out.

431
00:38:43,258 --> 00:38:44,499
It's okay.

432
00:38:44,499 --> 00:38:47,129
It's still in the testing stage, so it doesn't come with earphones.

433
00:38:48,068 --> 00:38:50,039
You can plug in any pair of earphones.

434
00:38:50,769 --> 00:38:53,309
The last time Ji Soo was at the studio...

435
00:38:53,368 --> 00:38:54,809
- Again... - No.

436
00:38:54,809 --> 00:38:56,508
Didn't she bring something?

437
00:38:57,178 --> 00:38:59,338
It was still wrapped in the studio.

438
00:39:05,379 --> 00:39:07,888
Oh, no. I completely forgot.

439
00:39:19,758 --> 00:39:21,669
Oh, no.

440
00:39:29,338 --> 00:39:32,439
It's a picture I took in 2012 in Misiryeong.

441
00:39:33,109 --> 00:39:35,879
I've been carrying it with me ever since.

442
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:41,088
I'm very glad I could give this to you.

443
00:39:43,588 --> 00:39:45,689
Please cherish it.

444
00:39:48,189 --> 00:39:49,528
Misiryeong.

445
00:39:53,269 --> 00:39:55,169
Year 2012.

446
00:39:58,769 --> 00:40:02,769
Ji Soo, thank you for the two gifts,

447
00:40:02,809 --> 00:40:04,738
the picture and the plant.

448
00:40:06,649 --> 00:40:08,349
I'm doing well.

449
00:40:10,948 --> 00:40:12,479
Seo Woo is strong as an ox.

450
00:40:12,479 --> 00:40:14,118
This is nothing.

451
00:40:14,249 --> 00:40:17,359
I'm being appreciated more for this and that.

452
00:40:18,258 --> 00:40:19,928
And...

453
00:40:23,059 --> 00:40:25,158
a lot of fun things happened too.

454
00:40:50,588 --> 00:40:53,758
I want to tell you only happy things,

455
00:40:53,928 --> 00:40:58,198
so I'm always looking for happy things in my life with a fine comb.

456
00:41:01,568 --> 00:41:03,769
But the happiest thing in my life right now...

457
00:41:04,868 --> 00:41:07,269
I'll tell you about that later.

458
00:41:08,539 --> 00:41:11,379
How would it have been if we had gotten...

459
00:41:11,939 --> 00:41:13,448
to know each other better?

460
00:41:14,678 --> 00:41:17,118
It may be difficult to know right now,

461
00:41:17,118 --> 00:41:18,979
but let's learn slowly with time.

462
00:41:19,048 --> 00:41:20,749
Sure. Okay.

463
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:26,059
Do you know where this is?

464
00:41:39,669 --> 00:41:41,238
It's here.

465
00:41:48,209 --> 00:41:52,649
I was standing here, and Ji Soo walked up from there.

466
00:41:56,859 --> 00:41:58,419
Where do you live?

467
00:41:58,459 --> 00:42:00,258
Why do you want to know that?

468
00:42:01,258 --> 00:42:02,959
I need to know to figure out where Ji Soo was.

469
00:42:02,959 --> 00:42:04,399
That's silly.

470
00:42:05,859 --> 00:42:07,729
Why do you want to know?

471
00:42:08,769 --> 00:42:10,039
Right?

472
00:42:10,568 --> 00:42:12,039
I just do.

473
00:42:17,109 --> 00:42:19,838
Do you see that chair under the street lamp up there?

474
00:42:20,379 --> 00:42:22,048
If you go up toward the left,

475
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:24,249
it's the first house past the corner.

476
00:42:24,249 --> 00:42:25,519
I live in the semi-basement.

477
00:42:33,218 --> 00:42:34,289
(Homestay)

478
00:43:16,499 --> 00:43:17,838
She's gone.

479
00:43:24,939 --> 00:43:25,939
Why...

480
00:43:26,678 --> 00:43:28,349
did I hide?

481
00:43:29,278 --> 00:43:31,678
Your body probably reacted because there was a reason.

482
00:43:48,868 --> 00:43:49,928
Here.

483
00:43:54,368 --> 00:43:57,278
She took it on her way home after meeting you.

484
00:43:59,209 --> 00:44:00,849
What was she wearing?

485
00:44:00,849 --> 00:44:01,948
That too?

486
00:44:01,948 --> 00:44:04,079
Yes. I want to know.

487
00:44:08,349 --> 00:44:12,218
She was wearing a dress coat and boots. Long boots.

488
00:44:13,658 --> 00:44:15,859
Ji Soo wore boots all the time.

489
00:44:20,968 --> 00:44:24,468
She was wearing tan leather gloves although it wasn't cold.

490
00:44:29,269 --> 00:44:31,379
Probably so the box wouldn't slip.

491
00:44:31,379 --> 00:44:33,439
Why do you want to know everything?

492
00:44:36,948 --> 00:44:39,218
This is how I miss her.

493
00:45:33,499 --> 00:45:34,868
Ji Soo.

494
00:45:36,439 --> 00:45:41,379
He wants to know everything about you.

495
00:45:44,419 --> 00:45:45,879
"I miss you."

496
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:48,749
"I love you. I like you."

497
00:45:50,019 --> 00:45:51,919
His one sentence incorporates them all.

498
00:45:52,658 --> 00:45:53,988
The sentence that's unique to him.

499
00:45:56,229 --> 00:45:57,329
"I want to know."

500
00:46:17,249 --> 00:46:18,349
Come here.

501
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:21,118
Next to you?

502
00:46:38,868 --> 00:46:39,939
It's coming.

503
00:46:58,388 --> 00:46:59,488
This is it.

504
00:47:03,658 --> 00:47:05,459
You're right. This is it.

505
00:47:09,269 --> 00:47:11,298
We watched this ever since we were kids.

506
00:47:50,879 --> 00:47:53,749
I don't know what it is exactly.

507
00:47:54,979 --> 00:47:57,349
I'm only telling you, Ji Soo.

508
00:48:02,118 --> 00:48:04,459
I really like looking...

509
00:48:05,289 --> 00:48:06,388
at him.

510
00:48:07,758 --> 00:48:09,959
He wants to be where you were,

511
00:48:10,829 --> 00:48:13,158
hear what you heard,

512
00:48:14,169 --> 00:48:17,138
and feel what you felt.

513
00:48:18,638 --> 00:48:20,838
I really like looking at him like this.

514
00:48:24,539 --> 00:48:27,379
I'm entranced by how he looks when he wants to know you more.

515
00:48:27,849 --> 00:48:28,979
I don't know what this is.

516
00:48:31,678 --> 00:48:32,919
It's an unrequited love.

517
00:48:41,158 --> 00:48:42,189
What was that?

518
00:48:42,959 --> 00:48:44,359
It's an unrequited love.

519
00:48:49,207 --> 00:48:50,546
It's an unrequited love.

520
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:01,256
What was that?

521
00:49:02,426 --> 00:49:03,856
It's an unrequited love.

522
00:49:14,336 --> 00:49:17,636
How could you fall for him missing me of all things?

523
00:49:18,207 --> 00:49:19,807
Seo Woo, you are so...

524
00:49:23,077 --> 00:49:24,247
Why are you so jumpy?

525
00:49:27,586 --> 00:49:28,847
Who's this?

526
00:49:33,316 --> 00:49:35,787
Oh, no. You're not looking too well, are you?

527
00:49:35,787 --> 00:49:37,457
- Is it dead? - Is the eucalyptus dead?

528
00:49:37,457 --> 00:49:38,796
- No. - What?

529
00:49:38,796 --> 00:49:41,667
- No. I mean... The euca... - That's right.

530
00:49:41,667 --> 00:49:44,997
Our poor Calyp is dying. They're finicky.

531
00:49:44,997 --> 00:49:46,497
Will it live if I water it now?

532
00:49:46,497 --> 00:49:48,867
You should've watered it right away. Save it.

533
00:49:49,037 --> 00:49:50,236
What do you keep saying?

534
00:49:50,236 --> 00:49:52,276
I mean, please save it.

535
00:49:56,477 --> 00:49:58,776
My gosh. You poor thing.

536
00:50:01,747 --> 00:50:02,847
Smell it.

537
00:50:03,486 --> 00:50:05,756
This is its scent. How nice is that?

538
00:50:08,457 --> 00:50:10,057
Can you tell whether or not it's alive by touching it?

539
00:50:10,057 --> 00:50:11,127
Of course.

540
00:50:11,127 --> 00:50:14,267
They make it so obvious when they're begging for water.

541
00:50:14,426 --> 00:50:15,667
You know the term "withering away"?

542
00:50:15,897 --> 00:50:18,836
That's what it's saying now. Imagine how painful it is.

543
00:50:19,796 --> 00:50:21,807
Oh, no. Please save it.

544
00:50:22,606 --> 00:50:25,276
When did you buy this? I never saw it before.

545
00:50:25,506 --> 00:50:27,906
It was a gift, but I completely forgot.

546
00:50:28,176 --> 00:50:29,247
What should I do?

547
00:50:30,147 --> 00:50:31,977
Okay, let's save it.

548
00:50:32,147 --> 00:50:33,776
Is it possible? Can we save it?

549
00:50:34,247 --> 00:50:37,356
That's how they are. They survive even with a tiny speck of love.

550
00:50:37,856 --> 00:50:39,957
They don't let your efforts go to waste.

551
00:50:40,316 --> 00:50:41,727
That's why I adore them.

552
00:50:42,227 --> 00:50:43,627
Let's do all we can.

553
00:51:17,256 --> 00:51:18,557
I barely touched you.

554
00:51:18,957 --> 00:51:20,667
Ji Soo asked me to save it.

555
00:51:23,526 --> 00:51:26,296
That eu... Eucal... That...

556
00:51:29,466 --> 00:51:33,336
So, you lent it to me to make me keep talking to her.

557
00:51:33,336 --> 00:51:35,776
- I brought her out. - I wasn't expecting much.

558
00:51:35,776 --> 00:51:38,617
You probably didn't expect me to chat with her everywhere I went.

559
00:51:40,577 --> 00:51:42,886
Think hard about what you said that made her come out.

560
00:51:43,086 --> 00:51:46,617
I was talking to Ji Soo, wasn't I? That's what this is, isn't it?

561
00:51:49,687 --> 00:51:52,497
Can you tell me the details of where and how...

562
00:51:52,497 --> 00:51:53,856
Ji Soo came out?

563
00:51:54,227 --> 00:51:57,167
- What you talked about... - So that's what this is.

564
00:51:58,196 --> 00:51:59,437
It isn't Ji Soo.

565
00:52:00,466 --> 00:52:03,307
It's a conversation device with Ji Soo's character and emotions.

566
00:52:03,307 --> 00:52:05,037
Why... Why did you make this?

567
00:52:05,276 --> 00:52:06,506
It has many uses.

568
00:52:07,446 --> 00:52:09,807
It can provide psychiatric therapy,

569
00:52:09,807 --> 00:52:11,077
prevent dementia,

570
00:52:11,077 --> 00:52:14,147
and you can talk to the person you want at any time for treatment.

571
00:52:14,917 --> 00:52:16,086
It's for treatment.

572
00:52:16,586 --> 00:52:18,656
Who is this one treating?

573
00:52:21,086 --> 00:52:22,827
It's a procedural test.

574
00:52:23,287 --> 00:52:24,327
And...

575
00:52:25,296 --> 00:52:28,066
it helps me at least.

576
00:52:34,066 --> 00:52:36,207
Where did she react to you?

577
00:52:38,506 --> 00:52:41,207
- In the studio. - It's an unrequited love.

578
00:52:42,577 --> 00:52:44,347
What did she say?

579
00:52:45,446 --> 00:52:46,617
I can't remember.

580
00:52:51,086 --> 00:52:52,256
Not there.

581
00:52:53,187 --> 00:52:54,227
Here.

582
00:52:59,696 --> 00:53:02,167
Do that with your hand.

583
00:53:11,236 --> 00:53:13,106
Feel your pulse there, and concentrate.

584
00:53:21,386 --> 00:53:23,617
- It's an unrequited love. - So...

585
00:53:25,287 --> 00:53:27,216
why do you want to know that?

586
00:53:31,327 --> 00:53:33,656
It's the SA node principle. The heart rate principle.

587
00:53:33,997 --> 00:53:36,127
One spot brought about everything.

588
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:39,437
One decisive puzzle piece made Ji Soo come together.

589
00:53:41,707 --> 00:53:44,276
If you keep talking to it, it'll find her on its own.

590
00:53:44,836 --> 00:53:46,437
We call it the point of reaction.

591
00:53:47,877 --> 00:53:49,477
What was that...

592
00:53:50,176 --> 00:53:53,017
If you explain what you were talking about,

593
00:53:53,546 --> 00:53:54,886
I can extrapolate.

594
00:53:56,816 --> 00:54:00,716
I was talking about this and that in the studio, and she came out.

595
00:54:00,716 --> 00:54:01,856
This and that? What?

596
00:54:02,057 --> 00:54:05,026
Just... This and that. Mostly about me and my feelings.

597
00:54:05,426 --> 00:54:06,827
I can't tell you that.

598
00:54:18,736 --> 00:54:20,377
What kind of feelings?

599
00:54:22,347 --> 00:54:25,446
There's something only Ji Soo and I talked about.

600
00:54:25,446 --> 00:54:27,687
It was a continuation of something we've been talking about.

601
00:54:28,546 --> 00:54:31,156
I said I was like this, so...

602
00:54:31,156 --> 00:54:33,486
I really like looking at him like this.

603
00:54:33,486 --> 00:54:35,386
I said I feel this and that because of this and that...

604
00:54:35,386 --> 00:54:38,557
I'm entranced by how he looks when he wants to know you more.

605
00:54:38,557 --> 00:54:40,227
- It's an unrequited love. - So she said it's that.

606
00:54:40,597 --> 00:54:43,127
You said you feel this and that...

607
00:54:43,897 --> 00:54:45,267
because of this and that...

608
00:54:45,796 --> 00:54:48,707
so she said it's... It's what?

609
00:54:49,037 --> 00:54:52,506
She said it's such-and-such. She gave me a clear diagnosis.

610
00:54:52,977 --> 00:54:54,276
She said it's such-and-such.

611
00:54:55,247 --> 00:54:56,506
Three words.

612
00:54:56,776 --> 00:54:59,617
- How was the weather? - Average.

613
00:55:00,886 --> 00:55:02,417
You really wrote that.

614
00:55:02,417 --> 00:55:03,986
Why are you writing that?

615
00:55:04,017 --> 00:55:05,417
Why do you want to know the point of reaction?

616
00:55:05,457 --> 00:55:07,287
Ji Soo came out. That's what matters.

617
00:55:11,856 --> 00:55:13,627
I wondered if it was because of me.

618
00:55:16,696 --> 00:55:17,867
Because...

619
00:55:19,966 --> 00:55:22,167
Ji Soo was the decisive element for me.

620
00:55:24,037 --> 00:55:26,006
The thunder is so loud.

621
00:55:26,176 --> 00:55:29,176
Four o'clock in the afternoon. It's daytime, but it's dark.

622
00:55:29,247 --> 00:55:31,316
Norway. Oslo.

623
00:55:31,776 --> 00:55:34,787
The forest on the way home from school. Dark afternoons.

624
00:55:35,446 --> 00:55:36,687
Do you remember?

625
00:55:39,457 --> 00:55:41,227
Ji Soo used to get scared.

626
00:55:43,386 --> 00:55:45,156
I wondered if I was...

627
00:55:46,127 --> 00:55:48,127
the reason for Ji Soo too.

628
00:55:59,377 --> 00:56:00,606
I wonder...

629
00:56:01,147 --> 00:56:03,847
if I mentioned the name Ha Won.

630
00:56:06,716 --> 00:56:09,486
Ji Soo was the thunder and lightning. Do you get it?

631
00:56:10,247 --> 00:56:12,316
There are things we knew since we were young.

632
00:56:12,886 --> 00:56:14,457
No one else knows.

633
00:56:14,486 --> 00:56:17,926
I may have been in a word you said without thinking.

634
00:56:19,856 --> 00:56:22,026
If you tell me what you spoke to her about,

635
00:56:22,026 --> 00:56:23,267
I will interpret it.

636
00:56:26,867 --> 00:56:28,437
Then...

637
00:56:29,667 --> 00:56:33,636
if it really was you that drew her out,

638
00:56:34,776 --> 00:56:36,776
if you confirm that,

639
00:56:37,977 --> 00:56:39,747
can you forget her?

640
00:56:41,486 --> 00:56:43,086
Why must I forget her?

641
00:57:12,276 --> 00:57:13,546
Ji Soo.

642
00:57:29,526 --> 00:57:31,537
Her emotions...

643
00:57:33,167 --> 00:57:34,437
and character.

644
00:57:34,437 --> 00:57:36,667
I can't see him.

645
00:57:41,776 --> 00:57:44,006
There's no way she'll come out.

646
00:57:55,026 --> 00:57:56,327
It's me.

647
00:57:59,696 --> 00:58:02,566
Knock, knock, knock, knock.

648
00:58:02,696 --> 00:58:04,796
Knock, knock.

649
00:58:04,796 --> 00:58:06,336
Seo Woo, are you alone?

650
00:58:13,176 --> 00:58:16,276
How's the eucalyptus plant? Can you save it?

651
00:58:17,877 --> 00:58:21,287
Of course. I can save it.

652
00:58:21,716 --> 00:58:23,847
That place must not have any furniture.

653
00:58:24,656 --> 00:58:26,256
How did you know?

654
00:58:26,256 --> 00:58:28,057
The sound is echoing.

655
00:58:28,057 --> 00:58:29,886
Like you're in an empty room.

656
00:58:31,256 --> 00:58:34,356
I came early, and it's empty.

657
00:58:34,966 --> 00:58:38,997
Ji Soo, you sound cheerful. It sounds different.

658
00:58:39,867 --> 00:58:41,807
I'm usually cheerful.

659
00:58:42,566 --> 00:58:44,606
I liked the studio.

660
00:58:45,336 --> 00:58:47,377
The sound is cozier there.

661
00:58:47,776 --> 00:58:50,077
It's a good place to share secrets.

662
00:58:50,077 --> 00:58:52,216
I liked your story too.

663
00:58:53,517 --> 00:58:57,117
What about me? I think I'm getting a call.

664
00:58:57,886 --> 00:58:59,986
I have a call. I can't talk anymore.

665
00:58:59,986 --> 00:59:01,526
- I... - About Misiryeong.

666
00:59:07,227 --> 00:59:09,597
Everyone makes mistakes.

667
00:59:10,597 --> 00:59:12,667
Even nature makes mistakes.

668
00:59:14,136 --> 00:59:15,867
My parents...

669
00:59:17,267 --> 00:59:20,106
died in a forest fire.

670
00:59:22,176 --> 00:59:24,977
I don't usually tell people this.

671
00:59:26,347 --> 00:59:30,287
I didn't know who to hate and resent.

672
00:59:31,457 --> 00:59:33,057
For a while,

673
00:59:33,716 --> 00:59:35,656
I was miserable because of that.

674
00:59:38,227 --> 00:59:40,156
And then for a while,

675
00:59:41,426 --> 00:59:45,037
I was miserable that I survived by myself.

676
00:59:50,667 --> 00:59:51,877
And now,

677
00:59:52,577 --> 00:59:54,577
I just live day by day.

678
00:59:57,276 --> 00:59:58,647
Today...

679
00:59:59,446 --> 01:00:02,287
It's Mom's favorite season.

680
01:00:03,886 --> 01:00:05,356
Now...

681
01:00:06,057 --> 01:00:08,586
It's the afternoon, Dad's favorite time of the day.

682
01:00:10,057 --> 01:00:12,127
I should cherish it all.

683
01:00:21,966 --> 01:00:24,167
Even nature makes mistakes.

684
01:00:25,276 --> 01:00:28,106
It's okay. It's nothing.

685
01:00:31,977 --> 01:00:34,216
Why are you suddenly bringing that up?

686
01:00:43,426 --> 01:00:45,327
Do you remember what you said?

687
01:00:45,397 --> 01:00:48,497
That you thought I had already met Ha Won.

688
01:00:48,667 --> 01:00:50,897
- Yes. - You were right.

689
01:00:51,167 --> 01:00:53,236
It was someone I knew.

690
01:00:53,236 --> 01:00:57,406
It was that person who rents the studio early in the morning.

691
01:00:57,406 --> 01:00:59,877
I thought so. And?

692
01:01:09,486 --> 01:01:11,287
Do you...

693
01:01:14,957 --> 01:01:17,957
want to try talking to Ha Won?

694
01:01:56,497 --> 01:01:58,636
(A Piece of Your Mind)

695
01:01:58,867 --> 01:02:00,767
It's all you.

696
01:02:00,767 --> 01:02:02,906
You're curious and imagine.

697
01:02:02,906 --> 01:02:05,906
This is nice. This is what an unrequited love is all about.

698
01:02:05,906 --> 01:02:07,077
Sneaking peeks.

699
01:02:07,077 --> 01:02:09,906
Why did two residents move out at the same time?

700
01:02:10,077 --> 01:02:11,647
Give her the room at the end.

701
01:02:11,647 --> 01:02:15,716
It's like the two of them were their only friend and family...

702
01:02:15,716 --> 01:02:17,046
Are you okay?

703
01:02:17,247 --> 01:02:18,986
I really wanted to see you.

704
01:02:18,986 --> 01:02:20,687
- At this hour? - All the time.

705
01:02:20,687 --> 01:02:21,687
All the time?

706
01:02:21,687 --> 01:02:23,026
Does Won know?
