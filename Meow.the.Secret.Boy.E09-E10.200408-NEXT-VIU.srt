00:00:06,447 --> 00:00:07,746
<b>(Why are you following me?)</b>

2
00:00:08,847 --> 00:00:10,046
<b>(Episode 9)</b>

3
00:00:10,647 --> 00:00:11,846
<b>Let me see.</b>

4
00:00:13,687 --> 00:00:14,716
<b>Okay.</b>

5
00:00:21,087 --> 00:00:22,087
<b>There you go.</b>

6
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,457
<b>It's yours now.</b>

7
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:28,297
<b>My lucky ring.</b>

8
00:00:33,037 --> 00:00:34,806
<b>Hong Jo.</b>

9
00:00:35,876 --> 00:00:37,737
<b>Hong Jo.</b>

10
00:00:38,637 --> 00:00:39,906
<b>Hong Jo.</b>

11
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,076
<b>I like you.</b>

12
00:00:46,417 --> 00:00:48,247
<b>Oh, really?</b>

13
00:00:48,387 --> 00:00:50,216
<b>You mean you like Hong Jo, right?</b>

14
00:00:50,756 --> 00:00:51,857
<b>You.</b>

15
00:00:55,627 --> 00:00:57,696
<b>- What?
- Hong Jo...</b>

16
00:00:58,127 --> 00:00:59,366
<b>likes you, too.</b>

17
00:01:05,807 --> 00:01:09,006
<b>I guess he talks to you.</b>

18
00:01:09,006 --> 00:01:10,506
<b>Then can you tell Hong Jo...</b>

19
00:01:10,506 --> 00:01:12,476
<b>not to splatter the sand
in his bathroom?</b>

20
00:01:13,877 --> 00:01:15,006
<b>Goodnight.</b>

21
00:01:22,756 --> 00:01:25,886
<b>What was that?
My heart almost fluttered.</b>

22
00:01:26,026 --> 00:01:27,827
<b>Gosh, I almost had a heart attack.</b>

23
00:01:39,606 --> 00:01:41,366
<b>This wasn't here before.</b>

24
00:01:42,506 --> 00:01:44,537
<b>Do you work here?</b>

25
00:01:45,207 --> 00:01:47,006
<b>Yes, I own the place.</b>

26
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:49,717
<b>Can I have some coffee at your cafe?</b>

27
00:01:50,517 --> 00:01:54,386
<b>We're closed already. I'm sorry.</b>

28
00:01:54,386 --> 00:01:56,017
<b>Then maybe next time.</b>

29
00:02:25,676 --> 00:02:28,016
<b>Hong Jo, come here.</b>

30
00:02:40,726 --> 00:02:42,296
<b>("Cats want to come inside
if you send them outside.")</b>

31
00:02:42,296 --> 00:02:43,337
<b>("And if you bring them inside,
they want to go outside.")</b>

32
00:02:43,337 --> 00:02:45,097
<b>("And sometimes,
they want to do both.")</b>

33
00:02:48,736 --> 00:02:49,736
<b>My gosh.</b>

34
00:02:54,847 --> 00:02:56,046
<b>What?</b>

35
00:02:56,647 --> 00:02:58,617
<b>Why isn't the hot water coming out?</b>

36
00:03:04,986 --> 00:03:06,726
<b>Guk Bong.</b>

37
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:09,356
<b>Are you sleeping?</b>

38
00:03:11,856 --> 00:03:13,597
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

39
00:03:14,266 --> 00:03:16,067
<b>But I think the boiler is broken.</b>

40
00:03:24,307 --> 00:03:25,576
<b>A woman?</b>

41
00:03:44,856 --> 00:03:46,796
<b>I don't think
I can wash my hair today.</b>

42
00:03:56,907 --> 00:03:58,307
<b>You're leaving already?</b>

43
00:04:04,676 --> 00:04:07,847
<b>Is someone here?</b>

44
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:09,557
<b>Who?</b>

45
00:04:10,856 --> 00:04:13,627
<b>I'm going to leave early
because I have a lot of work to do.</b>

46
00:04:13,627 --> 00:04:16,196
<b>So you can relax
and enjoy your time.</b>

47
00:04:16,796 --> 00:04:18,057
<b>Let's leave together.</b>

48
00:04:18,856 --> 00:04:20,067
<b>I also have a part-time job.</b>

49
00:04:20,097 --> 00:04:21,296
<b>- You're just going to leave?
- What?</b>

50
00:04:24,267 --> 00:04:26,166
<b>Are you worried about Hong Jo?</b>

51
00:04:27,936 --> 00:04:30,236
<b>I guess you're also a guy.</b>

52
00:04:30,876 --> 00:04:32,106
<b>What do you mean?</b>

53
00:04:32,106 --> 00:04:33,147
<b>Nothing.</b>

54
00:04:39,287 --> 00:04:40,486
<b>Wait up.</b>

55
00:04:51,926 --> 00:04:54,467
<b>A skinny woman with long hair?</b>

56
00:04:55,936 --> 00:04:58,366
<b>I thought he'd be different
from other guys.</b>

57
00:04:59,407 --> 00:05:01,907
<b>But I guess he's just the same.</b>

58
00:05:01,907 --> 00:05:04,376
<b>Guys all like
the same type of women.</b>

59
00:05:06,947 --> 00:05:09,007
<b>My gosh, what am I saying?</b>

60
00:05:11,676 --> 00:05:13,686
<b>Why do I feel so weird?</b>

61
00:05:24,827 --> 00:05:25,856
<b>(Jae Seon)</b>

62
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:27,926
<b>Let's meet tonight.</b>

63
00:05:33,467 --> 00:05:34,866
<b>Thanks.</b>

64
00:05:36,476 --> 00:05:39,207
<b>But why did you want to see me?</b>

65
00:05:41,777 --> 00:05:43,577
<b>I want to apologize.</b>

66
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:50,616
<b>I was really mean to you last time.</b>

67
00:05:51,186 --> 00:05:52,287
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

68
00:05:53,757 --> 00:05:54,856
<b>Oh, that?</b>

69
00:05:55,486 --> 00:05:57,257
<b>Doo Sik told me...</b>

70
00:05:58,757 --> 00:06:00,827
<b>that you went around
searching for the cat.</b>

71
00:06:02,126 --> 00:06:03,967
<b>I heard you even dug up a hole.</b>

72
00:06:07,907 --> 00:06:09,907
<b>I really had no idea.</b>

73
00:06:12,007 --> 00:06:13,306
<b>You're not the type of person...</b>

74
00:06:13,847 --> 00:06:16,816
<b>who'd leave the cat outside
all by himself.</b>

75
00:06:23,556 --> 00:06:24,787
<b>You'd never do that.</b>

76
00:06:27,287 --> 00:06:28,426
<b>But...</b>

77
00:06:29,087 --> 00:06:30,356
<b>you did.</b>

78
00:06:30,926 --> 00:06:32,556
<b>That's weird.</b>

79
00:06:35,397 --> 00:06:38,066
<b>I always close the door,
but he always escapes.</b>

80
00:06:38,936 --> 00:06:40,866
<b>- He escapes?
- Yes.</b>

81
00:06:41,106 --> 00:06:42,707
<b>But he never goes too far away.</b>

82
00:06:43,137 --> 00:06:45,837
<b>I think he also thinks of this place
as his turf.</b>

83
00:06:45,837 --> 00:06:47,246
<b>Isn't it okay?</b>

84
00:06:47,606 --> 00:06:49,246
<b>You can also
take care of Hong Jo sometimes.</b>

85
00:06:49,616 --> 00:06:52,217
<b>No, it's too dangerous.
You should take him home.</b>

86
00:06:52,847 --> 00:06:54,147
<b>Okay.</b>

87
00:06:55,816 --> 00:06:56,986
<b>Wait.</b>

88
00:06:58,816 --> 00:07:01,387
<b>If you suddenly approach him,
he'll get startled and run away.</b>

89
00:07:02,186 --> 00:07:04,856
<b>- I'll get him for you.
- Okay.</b>

90
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:10,066
<b>You need to be really slow.</b>

91
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:23,176
<b>Just leave him be.
He'll find his way home.</b>

92
00:07:24,316 --> 00:07:27,616
<b>No, I'll get him for you.</b>

93
00:07:27,616 --> 00:07:31,157
<b>You should go home first.
I'll get him for you.</b>

94
00:07:33,556 --> 00:07:34,726
<b>Hong Jo.</b>

95
00:07:41,267 --> 00:07:43,866
<b>Where are you hiding? Come on out.</b>

96
00:07:53,647 --> 00:07:55,376
<b>You want to play hide-and-seek?</b>

97
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:00,116
<b>Wait.</b>

98
00:08:12,496 --> 00:08:13,726
<b>I found you.</b>

99
00:08:17,496 --> 00:08:18,566
<b>Wait.</b>

100
00:08:20,507 --> 00:08:24,376
<b>I think I left some cat treats
somewhere around here.</b>

101
00:09:02,706 --> 00:09:05,576
<b>- Mr. Bang?
- I think this is mine.</b>

102
00:09:07,216 --> 00:09:08,316
<b>No, I don't think so.</b>

103
00:09:11,757 --> 00:09:12,787
<b>Yes, it's mine.</b>

104
00:09:12,787 --> 00:09:14,787
<b>It belongs to someone else.
Please give it back.</b>

105
00:09:17,357 --> 00:09:18,657
<b>Whose is it?</b>

106
00:09:20,096 --> 00:09:22,027
<b>I'm sorry,
but I'm a little busy right now.</b>

107
00:09:27,436 --> 00:09:29,037
<b>Did you happen to see a cat?</b>

108
00:09:29,336 --> 00:09:31,277
<b>He went home.</b>

109
00:09:32,676 --> 00:09:34,546
<b>But he was here just now.</b>

110
00:09:36,647 --> 00:09:38,176
<b>I'll ask Sol Ah.</b>

111
00:09:38,816 --> 00:09:39,846
<b>No, don't.</b>

112
00:09:47,027 --> 00:09:48,627
<b>It's still somewhere near.</b>

113
00:09:48,627 --> 00:09:50,727
<b>Why do you care if he's home or not?
Just leave him alone.</b>

114
00:09:50,997 --> 00:09:52,357
<b>He's not even your cat.</b>

115
00:09:54,466 --> 00:09:56,296
<b>I think of him like he's mine.</b>

116
00:09:57,666 --> 00:10:00,637
<b>I was the one who found him.</b>

117
00:10:02,306 --> 00:10:03,477
<b>Back then,</b>

118
00:10:04,477 --> 00:10:06,676
<b>he was just a little kitten.</b>

119
00:10:10,446 --> 00:10:12,846
<b>He was wrapped around
in that scarf...</b>

120
00:10:13,787 --> 00:10:15,147
<b>and abandoned out in the cold.</b>

121
00:10:16,017 --> 00:10:19,857
<b>Does he think Sol Ah was the one
who abandoned me?</b>

122
00:10:21,987 --> 00:10:24,696
<b>Who abandoned me?</b>

123
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:27,926
<b>It's all in the past.</b>

124
00:10:32,497 --> 00:10:35,336
<b>(Take him if you want.)</b>

125
00:10:39,436 --> 00:10:41,346
<b>(Sol Ah)</b>

126
00:10:46,586 --> 00:10:48,647
<b>And that's how
it ended between us.</b>

127
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:54,157
<b>I'll take that.</b>

128
00:10:55,127 --> 00:10:56,397
<b>The owner threw it away.</b>

129
00:11:01,296 --> 00:11:06,966
<b>(Why are you so silent?)</b>

130
00:11:17,247 --> 00:11:19,316
<b>(Why are you so silent?)</b>

131
00:11:19,316 --> 00:11:21,487
<b>Quit running away
and tell the truth.</b>

132
00:11:24,186 --> 00:11:25,617
<b>Why can't it be me?</b>

133
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:29,657
<b>Why can't I mean anything to you?</b>

134
00:11:32,326 --> 00:11:33,397
<b>Tell me.</b>

135
00:11:35,497 --> 00:11:37,997
<b>Please, tell me so I can understand.</b>

136
00:11:38,466 --> 00:11:39,637
<b>She abandoned you.</b>

137
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:43,277
<b>Am I...</b>

138
00:11:44,407 --> 00:11:45,436
<b>the reason?</b>

139
00:11:52,176 --> 00:11:53,247
<b>What are you looking at?</b>

140
00:11:53,647 --> 00:11:56,657
<b>Did you decide to draw
"Beodul Love" again?</b>

141
00:11:59,257 --> 00:12:01,027
<b>Don't look. It's not ready yet.</b>

142
00:12:02,127 --> 00:12:04,096
<b>What if there was
a misunderstanding?</b>

143
00:12:05,796 --> 00:12:06,826
<b>What?</b>

144
00:12:07,596 --> 00:12:08,926
<b>Would the two be happy...</b>

145
00:12:10,037 --> 00:12:11,397
<b>once their misunderstanding
gets resolved?</b>

146
00:12:14,607 --> 00:12:15,666
<b>I'm not sure.</b>

147
00:12:17,477 --> 00:12:20,046
<b>Don't you want to know
why he suddenly...</b>

148
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:23,647
<b>shut the door?</b>

149
00:12:26,517 --> 00:12:27,686
<b>I used to be curious.</b>

150
00:12:31,556 --> 00:12:32,716
<b>But not anymore.</b>

151
00:12:34,227 --> 00:12:35,527
<b>You're the one who told me...</b>

152
00:12:36,657 --> 00:12:39,227
<b>that he'll always keep me waiting.</b>

153
00:12:41,326 --> 00:12:42,867
<b>The reason doesn't matter anymore.</b>

154
00:12:44,836 --> 00:12:46,836
<b>What matters is that he kept me
waiting for 10 years.</b>

155
00:12:48,206 --> 00:12:50,806
<b>You liked him for 10 years?</b>

156
00:12:54,046 --> 00:12:57,147
<b>Hey, enough about me.
Let's talk about you.</b>

157
00:12:59,247 --> 00:13:00,287
<b>You have...</b>

158
00:13:01,446 --> 00:13:02,747
<b>a girlfriend, don't you?</b>

159
00:13:05,787 --> 00:13:06,787
<b>You don't?</b>

160
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:09,627
<b>Then you did that
when you don't even like her?</b>

161
00:13:12,027 --> 00:13:14,566
<b>You're a lot more carefree
than I thought.</b>

162
00:13:16,326 --> 00:13:18,737
<b>But then again, this is your house,</b>

163
00:13:18,737 --> 00:13:19,806
<b>so I guess you can do
whatever you want.</b>

164
00:13:19,936 --> 00:13:22,767
<b>But shouldn't you at least
give me a heads up?</b>

165
00:13:23,007 --> 00:13:24,306
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

166
00:13:25,507 --> 00:13:30,176
<b>I told you everything about me,
but you never tell me anything.</b>

167
00:13:30,846 --> 00:13:34,216
<b>I admit that I tend to be
a little chatty.</b>

168
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:35,446
<b>But...</b>

169
00:13:36,186 --> 00:13:39,926
<b>I don't just go around
telling everyone how I feel.</b>

170
00:13:42,326 --> 00:13:44,857
<b>I feel like you know
too much about me now.</b>

171
00:13:52,936 --> 00:13:54,666
<b>Are you seriously not
going to tell me anything?</b>

172
00:13:55,537 --> 00:13:57,137
<b>Then I won't let you
peek on me anymore.</b>

173
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:12,287
<b>To a cat, 10 years is
almost a lifetime.</b>

174
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:17,196
<b>Because of me,
their love could never come true.</b>

175
00:14:18,627 --> 00:14:21,227
<b>And I'm the only one who knows
about their misunderstanding.</b>

176
00:14:24,637 --> 00:14:26,196
<b>I should tell them that it was
a misunderstanding, right?</b>

177
00:14:27,936 --> 00:14:31,037
<b>I should do that for Sol Ah, right?</b>

178
00:14:36,747 --> 00:14:38,517
<b>But if I tell them the truth,</b>

179
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:41,346
<b>what will happen to me?</b>

180
00:15:06,477 --> 00:15:07,877
<b>You're not the only one
who has a private life.</b>

181
00:15:09,346 --> 00:15:11,777
<b>(Bang Guk Bong, do not enter!)</b>

182
00:15:18,887 --> 00:15:20,287
<b>I should tell her today.</b>

183
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:25,826
<b>(Bang Guk Bong, do not enter!)</b>

184
00:15:51,657 --> 00:15:54,527
<b>Hong Jo, where are you?</b>

185
00:17:18,636 --> 00:17:19,806
<b>Who...</b>

186
00:17:24,316 --> 00:17:25,677
<b>Who are you?</b>

187
00:17:30,886 --> 00:17:32,386
<b>Did you just come out of that room?</b>

188
00:17:33,656 --> 00:17:35,856
<b>Oh, you're her boyfriend?
Is that why...</b>

189
00:17:36,427 --> 00:17:38,896
<b>Is that why she put up that sign?</b>

190
00:17:42,197 --> 00:17:44,866
<b>My name is Bang Guk Bong.</b>

191
00:17:56,717 --> 00:17:57,917
<b>The owner of this house...</b>

192
00:17:59,576 --> 00:18:01,086
<b>is my mother.</b>

193
00:18:06,957 --> 00:18:09,027
<b>I should go now.
I need to take a shower.</b>

194
00:18:29,806 --> 00:18:31,677
<b>Let's eat.</b>

195
00:18:35,417 --> 00:18:36,546
<b>I need to go to the toilet.</b>

196
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:39,316
<b>My gosh, darn it.</b>

197
00:18:55,437 --> 00:18:56,606
<b>Did you sleep well?</b>

198
00:19:05,576 --> 00:19:06,687
<b>Bang Guk Bong.</b>

199
00:19:07,287 --> 00:19:08,586
<b>Is this yours?</b>

200
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:14,987
<b>Then whose is this?</b>

201
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:20,027
<b>Did you cook this for me?</b>

202
00:19:20,467 --> 00:19:22,066
<b>What's the occasion?</b>

203
00:19:23,866 --> 00:19:26,237
<b>You felt bad, didn't you?</b>

204
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:29,237
<b>Thanks a lot.</b>

205
00:19:46,826 --> 00:19:49,086
<b>The water's cold again.</b>

206
00:19:49,927 --> 00:19:51,227
<b>Bang Guk Bong.</b>

207
00:19:51,396 --> 00:19:54,667
<b>I don't have hot water.
Is it hot upstairs?</b>

208
00:19:54,667 --> 00:19:55,667
<b>What?</b>

209
00:19:55,967 --> 00:19:59,467
<b>Your hair's soft.
You must've showered.</b>

210
00:19:59,667 --> 00:20:01,836
<b>Can I use your shower?</b>

211
00:20:02,237 --> 00:20:03,677
<b>I groom...</b>

212
00:20:04,237 --> 00:20:06,947
<b>Hey, wait! Wait.</b>

213
00:20:07,846 --> 00:20:08,977
<b>Why come up here?</b>

214
00:20:08,977 --> 00:20:10,677
<b>- I need to shower too.
- No.</b>

215
00:20:10,677 --> 00:20:11,977
<b>Why? What's wrong?</b>

216
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:13,277
<b>No. Don't do this.</b>

217
00:20:13,277 --> 00:20:15,316
<b>Why? What are you doing? Get out.</b>

218
00:20:15,787 --> 00:20:18,257
<b>My gosh. What's the matter?</b>

219
00:20:25,796 --> 00:20:26,967
<b>What a stink.</b>

220
00:20:28,866 --> 00:20:31,997
<b>Is this why
you didn't want me in here?</b>

221
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:34,366
<b>You should've said so.</b>

222
00:20:42,046 --> 00:20:43,917
<b>I need to shower. Go away.</b>

223
00:20:54,126 --> 00:20:55,886
<b>My goodness.</b>

224
00:21:13,977 --> 00:21:15,247
<b>My egg yolks.</b>

225
00:21:32,056 --> 00:21:33,056
<b>Are you going to work?</b>

226
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:34,197
<b>Yes.</b>

227
00:21:34,197 --> 00:21:35,866
<b>Good, good. Get going.</b>

228
00:21:36,267 --> 00:21:38,197
<b>- My coat.
- Your coat. I'll get it.</b>

229
00:21:38,197 --> 00:21:40,906
<b>Your coat. Your coat.</b>

230
00:21:43,007 --> 00:21:44,106
<b>Your coat.</b>

231
00:21:46,007 --> 00:21:48,046
<b>You don't have to help me with it.</b>

232
00:21:48,146 --> 00:21:50,277
<b>I can manage on my own.</b>

233
00:21:51,417 --> 00:21:52,717
<b>Let's go.</b>

234
00:21:55,646 --> 00:21:56,717
<b>There.</b>

235
00:21:56,886 --> 00:21:58,856
<b>What got into you today?</b>

236
00:21:58,856 --> 00:22:02,656
<b>It's okay. I'm not angry anymore.</b>

237
00:22:13,237 --> 00:22:14,366
<b>Have a good day.</b>

238
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:16,866
<b>Okay. Bye.</b>

239
00:22:27,146 --> 00:22:28,487
<b>- My bag.
- Your bag.</b>

240
00:22:28,487 --> 00:22:29,886
<b>Your bag. Your bag.</b>

241
00:22:30,086 --> 00:22:31,257
<b>Your bag.</b>

242
00:22:31,856 --> 00:22:34,156
<b>Here you go. Anything else?</b>

243
00:22:34,156 --> 00:22:35,457
<b>- Thank you.
- Sure.</b>

244
00:22:38,927 --> 00:22:40,767
<b>- My lip gloss.
- Lip gloss!</b>

245
00:22:40,767 --> 00:22:42,767
<b>Lip gloss, lip gloss. Lip gloss.</b>

246
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:04,656
<b>It's all done. I should
say hi today.</b>

247
00:23:16,167 --> 00:23:18,396
<b>What are you doing?
Shouldn't you leave?</b>

248
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:20,366
<b>I put it on all crooked.</b>

249
00:23:21,037 --> 00:23:22,507
<b>Get out already.</b>

250
00:23:23,007 --> 00:23:24,677
<b>You look just fine.</b>

251
00:23:26,136 --> 00:23:27,777
<b>You're pretty. Really pretty.</b>

252
00:23:27,777 --> 00:23:28,876
<b>What?</b>

253
00:23:29,576 --> 00:23:30,977
<b>You'll be late.</b>

254
00:23:31,247 --> 00:23:33,177
<b>You should go. Bye.</b>

255
00:23:33,177 --> 00:23:35,017
<b>- Goodbye.
- Bye. Bye!</b>

256
00:24:03,247 --> 00:24:04,717
<b>What did I just do?</b>

257
00:24:09,586 --> 00:24:11,086
<b>She left already?</b>

258
00:24:12,656 --> 00:24:14,257
<b>I keep missing her.</b>

259
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:17,856
<b>What is your name?</b>

260
00:24:19,096 --> 00:24:20,366
<b>Hong Jo.</b>

261
00:24:20,366 --> 00:24:22,697
<b>Hong's your surname
and you're called Jo?</b>

262
00:24:23,366 --> 00:24:25,136
<b>As in Joe?</b>

263
00:24:27,267 --> 00:24:30,207
<b>Relax. I won't tell my parents.</b>

264
00:24:31,177 --> 00:24:33,876
<b>Do you have to hide it, though?</b>

265
00:24:33,977 --> 00:24:35,906
<b>Isn't that uncomfortable?</b>

266
00:24:38,376 --> 00:24:40,886
<b>I didn't mean to hide it
in the beginning.</b>

267
00:24:41,987 --> 00:24:43,386
<b>I like her...</b>

268
00:24:44,457 --> 00:24:46,257
<b>and want to be with her.</b>

269
00:24:47,656 --> 00:24:48,856
<b>I know.</b>

270
00:24:49,257 --> 00:24:51,596
<b>You're hiding it
to protect something,</b>

271
00:24:52,296 --> 00:24:55,227
<b>but if you hide too much,
you can't protect anything.</b>

272
00:25:03,366 --> 00:25:05,207
<b>I'll stop hiding.</b>

273
00:25:05,876 --> 00:25:07,277
<b>I'll leave.</b>

274
00:25:07,576 --> 00:25:08,677
<b>What?</b>

275
00:25:09,576 --> 00:25:11,316
<b>What I meant was...</b>

276
00:25:11,316 --> 00:25:12,646
<b>Sorry for intruding.</b>

277
00:25:19,116 --> 00:25:21,687
<b>Excuse me? Hey.</b>

278
00:25:25,656 --> 00:25:27,727
<b>Did I leave my phone at home again?</b>

279
00:25:27,727 --> 00:25:30,967
<b>Hello. Good morning.</b>

280
00:25:31,866 --> 00:25:33,167
<b>Who are you?</b>

281
00:25:36,737 --> 00:25:37,737
<b>Mirror.</b>

282
00:25:40,846 --> 00:25:42,106
<b>What is this?</b>

283
00:25:42,106 --> 00:25:44,576
<b>This is just insane.</b>

284
00:25:47,076 --> 00:25:48,987
<b>What distracted you this morning?</b>

285
00:25:49,386 --> 00:25:52,056
<b>I don't know. I left
my phone at home too.</b>

286
00:25:52,056 --> 00:25:53,856
<b>It was buy 1 get 1 free today.</b>

287
00:25:53,856 --> 00:25:55,626
<b>Oh? Thanks.</b>

288
00:26:20,646 --> 00:26:22,287
<b>- Hello.
- Hello.</b>

289
00:26:22,287 --> 00:26:23,886
<b>- Hello.
- Ji Eun.</b>

290
00:26:23,886 --> 00:26:25,156
<b>Let's have some tea.</b>

291
00:26:25,156 --> 00:26:26,616
<b>Oh, okay.</b>

292
00:26:29,927 --> 00:26:33,697
<b>They went out again.
They do that too often.</b>

293
00:26:42,306 --> 00:26:44,806
<b>Oh, you're here? Okay.</b>

294
00:26:47,376 --> 00:26:48,707
<b>Is that ready?</b>

295
00:26:49,247 --> 00:26:50,816
<b>Oh, yes.</b>

296
00:26:53,277 --> 00:26:54,417
<b>Here you go.</b>

297
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:17,707
<b>The tone and mood
are nice and modern.</b>

298
00:27:18,507 --> 00:27:21,306
<b>My nephew will like it. Thanks.</b>

299
00:27:21,477 --> 00:27:25,816
<b>But now my kid's homeroom
teacher's getting married.</b>

300
00:27:26,146 --> 00:27:28,517
<b>Just switch the names
on this wedding invitation.</b>

301
00:27:29,086 --> 00:27:30,556
<b>Okay.</b>

302
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:35,156
<b>Oh, yes. But that's not my...</b>

303
00:27:35,227 --> 00:27:38,556
<b>Oh. Yes, that's true.</b>

304
00:27:38,727 --> 00:27:42,126
<b>Yes, don't worry. We'll do that.</b>

305
00:27:46,136 --> 00:27:47,267
<b>Sol Ah?</b>

306
00:27:47,267 --> 00:27:48,306
<b>Yes?</b>

307
00:27:48,306 --> 00:27:52,076
<b>The CEO character on the landscaping
company's logo needs changing.</b>

308
00:27:52,076 --> 00:27:53,237
<b>Oh, okay.</b>

309
00:27:54,876 --> 00:27:56,247
<b>- This?
- Yes.</b>

310
00:27:56,247 --> 00:27:58,747
<b>He wanted it to look just like him,</b>

311
00:27:58,747 --> 00:28:01,316
<b>but now he says it's an insult
to the balding population.</b>

312
00:28:01,316 --> 00:28:04,816
<b>It needs to be fixed right now
so that he won't fly into a rage.</b>

313
00:28:07,656 --> 00:28:11,227
<b>But this project was...</b>

314
00:28:11,227 --> 00:28:14,497
<b>Ji Eun was in charge of that.</b>

315
00:28:14,497 --> 00:28:16,267
<b>She can't work on something...</b>

316
00:28:16,267 --> 00:28:18,366
<b>this minor when
she's on a huge project.</b>

317
00:28:18,566 --> 00:28:19,937
<b>Sol Ah, you do it.</b>

318
00:28:19,937 --> 00:28:22,507
<b>I'm going out for a lunch meeting
with a client.</b>

319
00:28:22,507 --> 00:28:25,007
<b>Wait. Ms. Park.</b>

320
00:28:28,977 --> 00:28:30,616
<b>Ms. Park.</b>

321
00:28:31,477 --> 00:28:33,777
<b>It was my project. Let me...</b>

322
00:28:33,777 --> 00:28:37,816
<b>It's fine. You have something
more important to work on.</b>

323
00:28:43,757 --> 00:28:46,927
<b>You always end up
with smaller tasks.</b>

324
00:28:46,927 --> 00:28:51,296
<b>What kind of connection
does Ji Eun have with Ms. Park...</b>

325
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:52,997
<b>There she comes.</b>

326
00:28:55,366 --> 00:28:56,967
<b>- Let's go.
- Let's go.</b>

327
00:29:15,527 --> 00:29:18,027
<b>I feel so bad for you.
You can't even eat lunch.</b>

328
00:29:19,656 --> 00:29:21,566
<b>It's okay. You should go eat.</b>

329
00:29:24,066 --> 00:29:25,796
<b>- Okay.
- See you.</b>

330
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:40,576
<b>How long did it take...</b>

331
00:29:42,717 --> 00:29:44,487
<b>for you to get used to
living outdoors?</b>

332
00:29:48,487 --> 00:29:50,056
<b>I'm hoping it won't take long...</b>

333
00:29:52,356 --> 00:29:54,197
<b>since I also started out
as a stray cat.</b>

334
00:29:57,537 --> 00:29:59,267
<b>I'm the one who caused
the misunderstanding,</b>

335
00:29:59,267 --> 00:30:00,366
<b>so I should help them resolve it.</b>

336
00:30:03,336 --> 00:30:05,037
<b>And I'm tired...</b>

337
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:07,546
<b>of hiding who I am.</b>

338
00:30:27,667 --> 00:30:28,727
<b>How weird.</b>

339
00:30:33,167 --> 00:30:34,406
<b>I'm hungry.</b>

340
00:30:35,707 --> 00:30:37,267
<b>But why does my heart feel so empty?</b>

341
00:30:56,586 --> 00:30:58,027
<b>Would you like some?</b>

342
00:31:19,417 --> 00:31:20,517
<b>How weird.</b>

343
00:31:22,017 --> 00:31:23,086
<b>My heart feels so empty.</b>

344
00:31:26,556 --> 00:31:27,556
<b>What?</b>

345
00:31:33,197 --> 00:31:34,366
<b>Then how would you have felt?</b>

346
00:31:35,366 --> 00:31:38,596
<b>Your heart must've felt so empty
for 10 whole years.</b>

347
00:31:41,207 --> 00:31:42,207
<b>Are you...</b>

348
00:31:43,237 --> 00:31:44,406
<b>talking to me?</b>

349
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:47,177
<b>You must've felt so lonely.</b>

350
00:31:50,447 --> 00:31:51,876
<b>It must've been so difficult.</b>

351
00:31:56,687 --> 00:31:58,356
<b>Don't cry.</b>

352
00:32:03,427 --> 00:32:05,497
<b>You're making me cry as well.</b>

353
00:32:12,796 --> 00:32:13,896
<b>There.</b>

354
00:32:13,896 --> 00:32:17,267
<b>Let's put a fedora on him
since there's not much time.</b>

355
00:32:17,267 --> 00:32:19,237
<b>(Shiny and sparkly, Sunlighting)</b>

356
00:32:19,237 --> 00:32:20,277
<b>There we go.</b>

357
00:32:40,257 --> 00:32:41,697
<b>Is that the woman with long hair?</b>

358
00:32:44,636 --> 00:32:45,767
<b>10 years...</b>

359
00:32:48,707 --> 00:32:50,836
<b>is a very long time.</b>

360
00:33:01,287 --> 00:33:02,386
<b>I'm okay.</b>

361
00:33:07,086 --> 00:33:09,927
<b>Eun Ji Eun was the woman
with long hair?</b>

362
00:33:16,195 --> 00:33:17,425
<b>Thanks.</b>

363
00:33:18,196 --> 00:33:19,196
<b>But...</b>

364
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:22,935
<b>did you come here to give me this?</b>

365
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:26,175
<b>I think I should tell you.</b>

366
00:33:29,506 --> 00:33:31,546
<b>There's something I didn't tell you.</b>

367
00:33:32,206 --> 00:33:33,415
<b>Tell me?</b>

368
00:33:34,515 --> 00:33:36,346
<b>What couldn't you tell me?</b>

369
00:33:37,715 --> 00:33:39,246
<b>What is it?</b>

370
00:33:45,786 --> 00:33:46,955
<b>I...</b>

371
00:33:49,726 --> 00:33:50,866
<b>I'm...</b>

372
00:33:55,165 --> 00:33:56,805
<b>not Bang Guk Bong.</b>

373
00:33:57,635 --> 00:33:58,765
<b>What?</b>

374
00:33:58,805 --> 00:34:00,705
<b>I'm not Bang Guk Bong.</b>

375
00:34:02,275 --> 00:34:04,906
<b>What do you mean?</b>

376
00:34:18,626 --> 00:34:20,126
<b>What was that about?</b>

377
00:34:20,226 --> 00:34:22,396
<b>He just had to say
he's dating Ji Eun.</b>

378
00:34:22,525 --> 00:34:24,726
<b>Why would he deny his existence?</b>

379
00:34:29,465 --> 00:34:31,965
<b>I thought she was a quiet cat,</b>

380
00:34:32,206 --> 00:34:33,976
<b>but she's dating my housemate.</b>

381
00:34:34,976 --> 00:34:37,245
<b>She must hate me.</b>

382
00:34:38,006 --> 00:34:41,176
<b>When did they get so close?</b>

383
00:34:41,376 --> 00:34:43,885
<b>She already thinks
I told Ms. Park...</b>

384
00:34:43,885 --> 00:34:46,086
<b>about her webtoon.</b>

385
00:34:53,626 --> 00:34:55,555
<b>This meeting isn't getting anywhere.</b>

386
00:34:56,126 --> 00:34:58,825
<b>How about a chat as an ice-breaker?</b>

387
00:34:58,825 --> 00:34:59,896
<b>Shall we discuss the weather?</b>

388
00:34:59,896 --> 00:35:00,965
<b>Ji Eun.</b>

389
00:35:01,896 --> 00:35:03,706
<b>You're seeing someone, aren't you?</b>

390
00:35:05,605 --> 00:35:07,836
<b>I hoped to discuss
fine dust particles.</b>

391
00:35:10,445 --> 00:35:12,006
<b>I'm not.</b>

392
00:35:12,006 --> 00:35:14,016
<b>Then do you have...</b>

393
00:35:14,016 --> 00:35:17,685
<b>anything you want to tell me?</b>

394
00:35:21,185 --> 00:35:22,285
<b>Well...</b>

395
00:35:23,255 --> 00:35:24,655
<b>Not really.</b>

396
00:35:25,086 --> 00:35:26,095
<b>You know,</b>

397
00:35:26,095 --> 00:35:30,296
<b>like, do you have feelings
for someone I know?</b>

398
00:35:32,995 --> 00:35:34,836
<b>Let's stop talking about...</b>

399
00:35:34,836 --> 00:35:37,106
<b>private matters when we're at work.</b>

400
00:35:41,505 --> 00:35:43,905
<b>It's getting more frigid
by the second.</b>

401
00:35:45,646 --> 00:35:47,975
<b>I need to go out to breathe.</b>

402
00:35:52,886 --> 00:35:55,386
<b>How about we be friends
away from work?</b>

403
00:35:55,386 --> 00:35:58,625
<b>Since it came up,
how about starting today?</b>

404
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:03,196
<b>Can we try to get along?</b>

405
00:36:03,196 --> 00:36:05,065
<b>We must work together on a project.</b>

406
00:36:10,035 --> 00:36:12,606
<b>You can pick the location.</b>

407
00:36:12,606 --> 00:36:14,236
<b>I'll meet you anywhere.</b>

408
00:36:14,236 --> 00:36:15,706
<b>(Sonamu)</b>

409
00:36:17,706 --> 00:36:19,745
<b>Does it have to be here?</b>

410
00:36:53,815 --> 00:36:55,116
<b>Excuse me?</b>

411
00:36:55,315 --> 00:36:57,116
<b>Can I have some ice?</b>

412
00:36:58,315 --> 00:36:59,486
<b>Wait here.</b>

413
00:37:00,155 --> 00:37:01,386
<b>Yes, of course.</b>

414
00:37:22,435 --> 00:37:24,706
<b>Jae Seon. I'm here.</b>

415
00:37:24,706 --> 00:37:27,775
<b>Hey. Hong Jo's here too, inside.</b>

416
00:37:27,875 --> 00:37:29,016
<b>Hong Jo?</b>

417
00:37:56,275 --> 00:37:57,345
<b>This...</b>

418
00:37:58,975 --> 00:38:00,016
<b>This is...</b>

419
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:09,056
<b>Why is this here?</b>

420
00:38:09,826 --> 00:38:10,826
<b>I know.</b>

421
00:38:11,556 --> 00:38:13,256
<b>What is this doing here?</b>

422
00:38:15,355 --> 00:38:16,696
<b>This is my scarf.</b>

423
00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:18,626
<b>Right?</b>

424
00:38:19,365 --> 00:38:20,696
<b>Why do you have it?</b>

425
00:38:24,336 --> 00:38:25,436
<b>I found it.</b>

426
00:38:29,405 --> 00:38:30,506
<b>After you threw it away.</b>

427
00:38:33,415 --> 00:38:35,516
<b>I never threw it away.</b>

428
00:38:35,845 --> 00:38:37,215
<b>You probably didn't know,</b>

429
00:38:39,285 --> 00:38:40,915
<b>but that kitten you threw away.</b>

430
00:38:42,985 --> 00:38:44,155
<b>It was Hong Jo.</b>

431
00:38:46,256 --> 00:38:48,355
<b>I have no idea
what you're talking about.</b>

432
00:38:48,355 --> 00:38:50,326
<b>You wrapped him up in that scarf
and abandoned him.</b>

433
00:38:51,396 --> 00:38:52,566
<b>In a garbage dump.</b>

434
00:38:54,636 --> 00:38:56,766
<b>You must be mistaken.</b>

435
00:38:57,066 --> 00:38:59,436
<b>I wrapped this scarf
around a boy.</b>

436
00:39:00,275 --> 00:39:01,306
<b>You know,</b>

437
00:39:02,405 --> 00:39:06,376
<b>the day we were supposed to meet,
he was wandering around in the cold.</b>

438
00:39:06,545 --> 00:39:08,016
<b>I'm on my way home after work.</b>

439
00:39:09,816 --> 00:39:11,086
<b>Oh, really?</b>

440
00:39:12,646 --> 00:39:14,415
<b>Okay, see you later.</b>

441
00:39:23,595 --> 00:39:25,196
<b>Even the weather is on my side.</b>

442
00:39:44,345 --> 00:39:45,386
<b>Kid.</b>

443
00:39:46,915 --> 00:39:48,115
<b>What are you doing here?</b>

444
00:39:51,485 --> 00:39:53,225
<b>I needed to get him somewhere warm,</b>

445
00:39:53,525 --> 00:39:55,996
<b>so I brought him home
so I could look for his mom.</b>

446
00:39:56,425 --> 00:39:59,095
<b>But he suddenly vanished,
and I looked everywhere for him.</b>

447
00:40:01,436 --> 00:40:02,936
<b>You wrapped the scarf...</b>

448
00:40:04,266 --> 00:40:05,336
<b>around a boy?</b>

449
00:40:07,175 --> 00:40:08,206
<b>But...</b>

450
00:40:11,446 --> 00:40:13,345
<b>Hong Jo was found with this scarf?</b>

451
00:40:18,946 --> 00:40:20,016
<b>What happened?</b>

452
00:40:24,925 --> 00:40:26,456
<b>He must've been a kind boy.</b>

453
00:40:28,496 --> 00:40:29,965
<b>He was cold too,</b>

454
00:40:31,266 --> 00:40:32,925
<b>but he covered Hong Jo with it.</b>

455
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:39,465
<b>I don't know what's going on.</b>

456
00:40:41,235 --> 00:40:42,706
<b>I think I do now.</b>

457
00:40:47,275 --> 00:40:48,915
<b>Why you were like that to me.</b>

458
00:40:49,576 --> 00:40:52,016
<b>The person you have reached
is unavailable. Please leave...</b>

459
00:40:53,915 --> 00:40:55,715
<b>(Where are you? Is something wrong?)</b>

460
00:40:59,485 --> 00:41:01,496
<b>I think I was mistaken...</b>

461
00:41:01,496 --> 00:41:02,556
<b>No.</b>

462
00:41:03,865 --> 00:41:05,196
<b>It's not because of that.</b>

463
00:41:11,806 --> 00:41:13,405
<b>It's because that's who you are,
Jae Seon.</b>

464
00:41:14,975 --> 00:41:16,076
<b>That's who you are.</b>

465
00:41:21,316 --> 00:41:22,845
<b>You always do things alone.</b>

466
00:41:23,816 --> 00:41:26,016
<b>You think alone,
and always draw conclusions alone.</b>

467
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:27,516
<b>You never ask me.</b>

468
00:41:28,485 --> 00:41:29,655
<b>That's who you are.</b>

469
00:41:31,456 --> 00:41:33,326
<b>And that's the way you treat me.</b>

470
00:41:37,095 --> 00:41:38,826
<b>You mentioned the scarf before...</b>

471
00:41:38,826 --> 00:41:40,336
<b>to test me, didn't you?</b>

472
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:42,766
<b>You should've just told me
the truth.</b>

473
00:41:42,766 --> 00:41:44,666
<b>You should've gotten mad
and asked me instead.</b>

474
00:41:45,066 --> 00:41:48,336
<b>Didn't I ask you
to please talk to me?</b>

475
00:41:49,276 --> 00:41:51,276
<b>I didn't know I was mistaken
about this either...</b>

476
00:41:51,276 --> 00:41:52,505
<b>Wasn't it an excuse?</b>

477
00:41:58,645 --> 00:42:01,156
<b>You were afraid to open up to me,</b>

478
00:42:02,115 --> 00:42:04,656
<b>and you saw an abandoned cat
in front of you.</b>

479
00:42:07,456 --> 00:42:08,995
<b>It was the perfect excuse.</b>

480
00:42:10,725 --> 00:42:12,166
<b>An excuse to push me away.</b>

481
00:42:16,865 --> 00:42:18,765
<b>An excuse to be alone until the end.</b>

482
00:42:23,745 --> 00:42:26,245
<b>You pushed away everyone near you
like that, didn't you?</b>

483
00:42:31,645 --> 00:42:32,946
<b>In case you fell in love.</b>

484
00:42:44,066 --> 00:42:45,495
<b>I'll take this.</b>

485
00:42:52,936 --> 00:42:54,836
<b>Am I late?</b>

486
00:42:55,135 --> 00:42:56,276
<b>Oh, right.</b>

487
00:42:57,875 --> 00:42:59,605
<b>We were supposed to meet.</b>

488
00:43:01,615 --> 00:43:03,745
<b>I don't feel like drinking coffee
right now.</b>

489
00:43:05,546 --> 00:43:07,015
<b>Then, next time.</b>

490
00:43:09,885 --> 00:43:10,926
<b>By any chance...</b>

491
00:43:13,186 --> 00:43:15,796
<b>How about a drink?</b>

492
00:43:32,605 --> 00:43:34,515
<b>He prefers to do things alone
so much,</b>

493
00:43:34,615 --> 00:43:36,985
<b>that there's no room left for me
to squeeze into his life.</b>

494
00:43:38,186 --> 00:43:41,485
<b>He's all alone. A total loner.</b>

495
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:46,485
<b>Wait.</b>

496
00:43:47,225 --> 00:43:48,796
<b>You drank alone again?</b>

497
00:43:59,265 --> 00:44:00,375
<b>I guess Lee Jae Seon...</b>

498
00:44:01,005 --> 00:44:03,645
<b>is someone who thinks
on his own a lot.</b>

499
00:44:03,906 --> 00:44:04,906
<b>Right?</b>

500
00:44:05,276 --> 00:44:09,515
<b>I knew it. A cat knows
another cat so well!</b>

501
00:44:10,015 --> 00:44:11,686
<b>Cheers. Cheers!</b>

502
00:44:21,595 --> 00:44:22,595
<b>Sorry.</b>

503
00:44:24,765 --> 00:44:28,395
<b>Still, aren't you glad to find out
he was mistaken?</b>

504
00:44:29,395 --> 00:44:30,465
<b>I'm not sure.</b>

505
00:44:31,406 --> 00:44:34,135
<b>Now that I know,
I feel even more dumbfounded.</b>

506
00:44:34,576 --> 00:44:36,906
<b>That he was more alone
than I thought.</b>

507
00:44:37,776 --> 00:44:40,475
<b>That I was totally mistaken
thinking there was...</b>

508
00:44:41,645 --> 00:44:43,916
<b>something between us
even when he didn't say anything.</b>

509
00:44:46,755 --> 00:44:47,786
<b>But...</b>

510
00:44:49,316 --> 00:44:50,526
<b>why are you...</b>

511
00:44:51,586 --> 00:44:53,426
<b>telling me this?</b>

512
00:44:55,625 --> 00:44:57,895
<b>Do I sound so pathetic?</b>

513
00:44:57,895 --> 00:44:58,895
<b>No.</b>

514
00:45:00,436 --> 00:45:01,536
<b>What should I say?</b>

515
00:45:02,936 --> 00:45:04,635
<b>Isn't it a secret?</b>

516
00:45:06,005 --> 00:45:08,105
<b>Don't friends share secrets?</b>

517
00:45:09,306 --> 00:45:10,345
<b>See?</b>

518
00:45:10,345 --> 00:45:12,745
<b>We're talking comfortably now.
We're friends.</b>

519
00:45:14,345 --> 00:45:15,875
<b>Friends...</b>

520
00:45:29,456 --> 00:45:30,965
<b>You can really hold your liquor.</b>

521
00:45:31,826 --> 00:45:34,735
<b>Why does it feel like
I'm the only one getting drunk?</b>

522
00:45:34,865 --> 00:45:37,536
<b>Beer just makes me feel full.</b>

523
00:45:38,135 --> 00:45:39,265
<b>Oh, really?</b>

524
00:45:41,176 --> 00:45:44,345
<b>Ma'am? Can we have some soju?</b>

525
00:45:52,786 --> 00:45:53,786
<b>Here.</b>

526
00:45:59,485 --> 00:46:02,556
<b>Now, it's your turn
to share your secret.</b>

527
00:46:04,495 --> 00:46:06,196
<b>What's your relationship
with Ms. Park?</b>

528
00:46:09,336 --> 00:46:14,235
<b>It's just that people at work
seem to be mistaken about you.</b>

529
00:46:14,936 --> 00:46:16,235
<b>I don't think that's true.</b>

530
00:46:17,845 --> 00:46:19,105
<b>I didn't use connections
to work here.</b>

531
00:46:21,076 --> 00:46:23,015
<b>I never mentioned
your webtoon either.</b>

532
00:46:23,885 --> 00:46:24,916
<b>Right?</b>

533
00:46:25,985 --> 00:46:27,156
<b>I knew it.</b>

534
00:46:27,885 --> 00:46:31,225
<b>Then what do you two talk about
all the time?</b>

535
00:46:31,786 --> 00:46:32,855
<b>What is it?</b>

536
00:46:39,995 --> 00:46:42,936
<b>Well, if it's hard to tell me...</b>

537
00:46:50,776 --> 00:46:52,145
<b>Let's talk about guys.</b>

538
00:46:53,276 --> 00:46:54,446
<b>You like someone, don't you?</b>

539
00:46:59,615 --> 00:47:00,885
<b>I'm kind of like you.</b>

540
00:47:02,985 --> 00:47:04,186
<b>It's been a long time...</b>

541
00:47:05,225 --> 00:47:06,686
<b>since I've had a crush on him.</b>

542
00:47:08,056 --> 00:47:10,296
<b>We keep getting close
then fall apart.</b>

543
00:47:12,296 --> 00:47:13,566
<b>For how long?</b>

544
00:47:15,995 --> 00:47:17,336
<b>Since high school.</b>

545
00:47:19,135 --> 00:47:20,276
<b>That long?</b>

546
00:47:23,336 --> 00:47:26,546
<b>Then you must know
everything about him.</b>

547
00:47:26,946 --> 00:47:27,946
<b>No.</b>

548
00:47:30,115 --> 00:47:32,046
<b>I didn't see him after graduating...</b>

549
00:47:32,515 --> 00:47:33,985
<b>but met him again by coincidence.</b>

550
00:47:35,956 --> 00:47:38,355
<b>I see him almost every day lately.</b>

551
00:47:40,056 --> 00:47:43,026
<b>But even when we're together,
it doesn't seem like I'm with him.</b>

552
00:47:45,225 --> 00:47:48,465
<b>I understand. He comes and goes
like the wind.</b>

553
00:47:50,135 --> 00:47:52,865
<b>So you noticed.</b>

554
00:47:54,105 --> 00:47:55,436
<b>Actually,</b>

555
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:59,605
<b>I saw you two on the bench today.</b>

556
00:48:00,475 --> 00:48:01,645
<b>On the bench?</b>

557
00:48:01,645 --> 00:48:02,816
<b>Yes.</b>

558
00:48:04,816 --> 00:48:06,086
<b>Oh, him?</b>

559
00:48:06,615 --> 00:48:09,556
<b>It's not him. That guy...</b>

560
00:48:09,615 --> 00:48:11,056
<b>I'd never met.</b>

561
00:48:11,156 --> 00:48:12,186
<b>What?</b>

562
00:48:12,826 --> 00:48:14,895
<b>Why would you do that to a stranger?</b>

563
00:48:14,895 --> 00:48:18,696
<b>He seemed hungry,
so I offered him food.</b>

564
00:48:18,725 --> 00:48:20,666
<b>You never slept over at my place?</b>

565
00:48:21,666 --> 00:48:22,995
<b>What do you mean?</b>

566
00:48:25,135 --> 00:48:26,166
<b>Never mind.</b>

567
00:48:26,836 --> 00:48:28,005
<b>Then...</b>

568
00:48:28,475 --> 00:48:32,375
<b>who is the person you like?</b>

569
00:48:45,326 --> 00:48:47,826
<b>I did all the talking again.</b>

570
00:48:49,926 --> 00:48:51,196
<b>We should go now.</b>

571
00:48:51,926 --> 00:48:53,225
<b>Let's go.</b>

572
00:48:58,735 --> 00:48:59,965
<b>Ko Doo Sik.</b>

573
00:49:09,475 --> 00:49:10,686
<b>Ko Doo Sik.</b>

574
00:49:12,145 --> 00:49:13,345
<b>I like him.</b>

575
00:49:40,446 --> 00:49:42,576
<b>You had too much to drink.</b>

576
00:49:42,576 --> 00:49:44,786
<b>I'll hail you a cab.</b>

577
00:49:45,115 --> 00:49:47,916
<b>- No, no. You can go first.
- No.</b>

578
00:49:47,916 --> 00:49:50,385
<b>- Be quiet.
- No.</b>

579
00:49:50,385 --> 00:49:51,926
<b>Trust me. I'll catch you a taxi.</b>

580
00:49:51,926 --> 00:49:54,956
<b>No. You go home first.</b>

581
00:49:55,026 --> 00:49:56,526
<b>Taxi!</b>

582
00:49:56,526 --> 00:49:58,365
<b>- You go home first.
- Taxi!</b>

583
00:49:58,365 --> 00:50:00,365
<b>- Go home.
- Don't stop here, taxi.</b>

584
00:50:00,365 --> 00:50:02,036
<b>- Don't stop.
- Stop!</b>

585
00:50:02,036 --> 00:50:04,306
<b>Stop, stop. There.</b>

586
00:50:04,306 --> 00:50:05,635
<b>- You take it.
- No.</b>

587
00:50:05,635 --> 00:50:07,336
<b>No, no. You...</b>

588
00:50:07,336 --> 00:50:08,505
<b>Get in.</b>

589
00:50:08,735 --> 00:50:11,745
<b>It's fine. I live nearby.</b>

590
00:50:11,745 --> 00:50:13,105
<b>I can walk.</b>

591
00:50:14,015 --> 00:50:17,086
<b>- Bye.
- Take care.</b>

592
00:50:17,516 --> 00:50:18,845
<b>Sol Ah.</b>

593
00:50:19,046 --> 00:50:21,415
<b>- This one.
- What are you doing?</b>

594
00:50:24,355 --> 00:50:25,925
<b>What are you doing? Tell me.</b>

595
00:50:25,925 --> 00:50:28,155
<b>- Why did it turn off?
- Sol Ah.</b>

596
00:50:28,195 --> 00:50:30,996
<b>- Take a photo.
- Sol Ah, come here.</b>

597
00:50:30,996 --> 00:50:33,226
<b>- I need to get the license plate.
- Sol Ah.</b>

598
00:50:33,736 --> 00:50:35,665
<b>- Take a photo.
- What are you doing?</b>

599
00:50:36,635 --> 00:50:37,806
<b>Take a photo.</b>

600
00:50:37,935 --> 00:50:40,576
<b>No, no. Again.</b>

601
00:50:41,635 --> 00:50:43,476
<b>Click. I did it!</b>

602
00:50:43,476 --> 00:50:46,006
<b>I got a photo. Get home safely!</b>

603
00:50:46,145 --> 00:50:48,546
<b>Driver, take her safely, please.</b>

604
00:50:48,546 --> 00:50:50,276
<b>I can't leave you.</b>

605
00:50:50,276 --> 00:50:52,445
<b>Sol Ah. Bye!</b>

606
00:50:52,445 --> 00:50:54,016
<b>- Okay.
- Bye!</b>

607
00:50:57,326 --> 00:51:00,826
<b>Okay, so now...</b>

608
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:06,395
<b>Now I have to get home.</b>

609
00:51:07,395 --> 00:51:10,836
<b>I can do this. I can do this. I can.</b>

610
00:51:14,076 --> 00:51:16,536
<b>You're doing it. You can do this.</b>

611
00:51:16,935 --> 00:51:18,276
<b>Keep going.</b>

612
00:51:20,845 --> 00:51:23,915
<b>Sol Ah, walk straight ahead. Okay!</b>

613
00:51:24,385 --> 00:51:27,355
<b>Straight ahead. March.</b>

614
00:51:30,155 --> 00:51:33,726
<b>Very nice. You're doing it.</b>

615
00:51:33,925 --> 00:51:36,296
<b>You don't look drunk at all.</b>

616
00:51:36,726 --> 00:51:38,226
<b>You're managing it.</b>

617
00:51:41,095 --> 00:51:43,195
<b>Did I forget anything?</b>

618
00:51:49,405 --> 00:51:50,806
<b>Let's see.</b>

619
00:51:51,476 --> 00:51:53,915
<b>My wallet.</b>

620
00:51:55,046 --> 00:51:56,175
<b>My phone.</b>

621
00:51:57,845 --> 00:52:00,216
<b>My phone. My phone.</b>

622
00:52:01,355 --> 00:52:03,685
<b>My phone.</b>

623
00:52:04,125 --> 00:52:07,326
<b>And... my scarf.</b>

624
00:52:09,355 --> 00:52:10,865
<b>My scarf.</b>

625
00:52:18,935 --> 00:52:20,576
<b>It's so warm.</b>

626
00:52:21,336 --> 00:52:24,246
<b>Okay. I have everything!</b>

627
00:52:33,445 --> 00:52:34,516
<b>You!</b>

628
00:52:35,316 --> 00:52:37,726
<b>Hey! Go away!</b>

629
00:53:24,365 --> 00:53:26,566
<b>That was crazy.</b>

630
00:53:26,836 --> 00:53:28,476
<b>I didn't fall down.</b>

631
00:54:01,336 --> 00:54:03,375
<b>How warm.</b>

632
00:54:28,466 --> 00:54:29,966
<b>Perhaps I can never...</b>

633
00:54:31,405 --> 00:54:33,236
<b>appear before you again.</b>

634
00:54:35,736 --> 00:54:37,445
<b>I might have to...</b>

635
00:54:38,405 --> 00:54:40,306
<b>look at you from behind.</b>

636
00:54:44,415 --> 00:54:46,145
<b>If I stay this far behind,</b>

637
00:54:47,556 --> 00:54:48,915
<b>will it be okay?</b>

638
00:54:55,455 --> 00:54:57,395
<b>It was the perfect excuse.</b>

639
00:54:57,925 --> 00:54:59,695
<b>An excuse to push me away.</b>

640
00:55:00,526 --> 00:55:02,836
<b>An excuse to be alone until the end.</b>

641
00:55:04,036 --> 00:55:06,806
<b>You pushed away everyone near you
like that, didn't you?</b>

642
00:55:07,806 --> 00:55:09,435
<b>In case you fell in love.</b>

643
00:55:29,026 --> 00:55:31,425
<b>I'm home.</b>

644
00:55:39,266 --> 00:55:40,875
<b>It's fixed.</b>

645
00:55:47,746 --> 00:55:49,216
<b>What's this?</b>

646
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:05,395
<b>What's this?</b>

647
00:56:07,395 --> 00:56:08,865
<b>Bang Guk Bong.</b>

648
00:56:09,736 --> 00:56:11,306
<b>Bang Guk Bong!</b>

649
00:56:12,836 --> 00:56:15,175
<b>Bang Guk Bong!</b>

650
00:56:37,256 --> 00:56:38,726
<b>I came to say goodbye.</b>

651
00:56:39,165 --> 00:56:41,135
<b>I might not be able to
come by often.</b>

652
00:56:41,466 --> 00:56:42,496
<b>Why not?</b>

653
00:56:44,665 --> 00:56:46,935
<b>I told a lie.</b>

654
00:56:47,266 --> 00:56:49,036
<b>Did you tell a bad lie?</b>

655
00:56:49,306 --> 00:56:51,645
<b>Were you caught
and you're going to prison?</b>

656
00:56:52,375 --> 00:56:54,375
<b>Does lying get you caught
and locked up?</b>

657
00:56:54,375 --> 00:56:56,175
<b>Not always.</b>

658
00:56:56,175 --> 00:56:58,316
<b>There are lies
that are okay to tell.</b>

659
00:56:58,945 --> 00:57:00,345
<b>There are?</b>

660
00:57:00,345 --> 00:57:02,216
<b>Don't you know about white lies?</b>

661
00:57:02,385 --> 00:57:04,425
<b>Lies you tell because
you like someone...</b>

662
00:57:04,425 --> 00:57:06,925
<b>aren't lies but good manners.</b>

663
00:57:06,925 --> 00:57:10,766
<b>My grandma said so.
It's like that between people.</b>

664
00:57:12,526 --> 00:57:14,026
<b>If I were a person,</b>

665
00:57:14,836 --> 00:57:17,536
<b>- I wouldn't have to lie.
- What?</b>

666
00:57:18,536 --> 00:57:22,006
<b>I have to lie to stay around.</b>

667
00:57:23,635 --> 00:57:25,105
<b>Because I'm me.</b>

668
00:57:30,945 --> 00:57:32,415
<b>That man is...</b>

669
00:57:45,026 --> 00:57:46,326
<b>Hello.</b>

670
00:57:46,526 --> 00:57:47,966
<b>Are you closed?</b>

671
00:57:48,665 --> 00:57:51,665
<b>Did you just come out of that house?</b>

672
00:57:52,705 --> 00:57:55,076
<b>Yes. I live in the house across.</b>

673
00:57:56,175 --> 00:57:57,405
<b>My friend lives there.</b>

674
00:57:58,375 --> 00:57:59,845
<b>Oh, a friend of yours?</b>

675
00:58:00,205 --> 00:58:02,746
<b>Yes. Who are you?</b>

676
00:58:03,415 --> 00:58:04,645
<b>I'm her stepbrother.</b>

677
00:58:06,345 --> 00:58:07,415
<b>Who?</b>

678
00:58:08,086 --> 00:58:10,615
<b>Another description would be
the landlady's son.</b>

679
00:58:12,625 --> 00:58:13,685
<b>What...</b>

680
00:58:16,355 --> 00:58:18,595
<b>Then are you...</b>

681
00:58:19,566 --> 00:58:23,635
<b>Yes. I am Bang Guk Bong.</b>

682
00:58:26,036 --> 00:58:27,675
<b>I'm glad you're friends.</b>

683
00:58:29,776 --> 00:58:31,705
<b>I'll pay for her coffee in advance.</b>

684
00:58:32,145 --> 00:58:34,105
<b>Tell her it's to celebrate
becoming a family.</b>

685
00:58:35,216 --> 00:58:37,816
<b>Are you really Bang Guk Bong?</b>

686
00:58:39,345 --> 00:58:40,415
<b>Yes.</b>

687
00:58:44,685 --> 00:58:46,586
<b>Goodbye then.</b>

688
00:59:23,955 --> 00:59:26,326
<b>I drank all this
and it's not enough.</b>

689
00:59:36,836 --> 00:59:37,945
<b>Bang Guk Bong.</b>

690
00:59:39,705 --> 00:59:40,776
<b>No.</b>

691
00:59:41,716 --> 00:59:42,746
<b>You're not...</b>

692
00:59:44,246 --> 00:59:45,645
<b>Bang Guk Bong, are you?</b>

693
00:59:51,125 --> 00:59:52,355
<b>What have you done?</b>

694
00:59:56,595 --> 00:59:58,026
<b>Why did you do it?</b>

695
01:00:01,566 --> 01:00:02,566
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

696
01:00:03,395 --> 01:00:05,635
<b>How could you lie to me?</b>

697
01:00:06,405 --> 01:00:07,506
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

698
01:00:08,435 --> 01:00:09,476
<b>I really am.</b>

699
01:00:12,175 --> 01:00:13,205
<b>You're...</b>

700
01:00:15,246 --> 01:00:17,716
<b>You're not Bang Guk Bong.</b>

701
01:00:20,286 --> 01:00:23,056
<b>How could you not be Bang Guk Bong?</b>

702
01:00:24,826 --> 01:00:26,086
<b>I wish...</b>

703
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:31,326
<b>- I were Bang Guk Bong.
- Don't lie!</b>

704
01:00:31,865 --> 01:00:33,625
<b>Then why would you do this?</b>

705
01:00:36,236 --> 01:00:38,135
<b>Who told you to change your name?</b>

706
01:00:38,135 --> 01:00:39,466
<b>(Name changed to "Bang Cruise")</b>

707
01:00:44,175 --> 01:00:45,205
<b>What?</b>

708
01:00:46,576 --> 01:00:49,115
<b>I enjoyed calling your old name.</b>

709
01:00:49,645 --> 01:00:51,415
<b>I want to keep calling you that.</b>

710
01:00:53,685 --> 01:00:54,756
<b>Hello.</b>

711
01:01:00,486 --> 01:01:02,726
<b>Long straight hair.</b>

712
01:01:05,125 --> 01:01:06,365
<b>That's my taste.</b>

713
01:01:06,895 --> 01:01:08,996
<b>It was a guy? What's going on?</b>

714
01:01:10,266 --> 01:01:11,935
<b>Is he Bang Guk Bong's friend?</b>

715
01:01:13,405 --> 01:01:15,806
<b>Or... are they dating?</b>

716
01:01:19,345 --> 01:01:21,516
<b>Do you come here often?</b>

717
01:01:21,816 --> 01:01:23,746
<b>Not often. Just sometimes.</b>

718
01:01:24,746 --> 01:01:27,115
<b>I changed the light bulb.</b>

719
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:30,885
<b>I fixed the boiler too.
The water's hot now.</b>

720
01:01:32,526 --> 01:01:34,796
<b>Why would you do all that?</b>

721
01:01:35,595 --> 01:01:36,695
<b>I feel bad now.</b>

722
01:01:36,695 --> 01:01:38,766
<b>You don't have to feel
so uncomfortable.</b>

723
01:01:39,865 --> 01:01:41,836
<b>I'll stay with my girlfriend.</b>

724
01:01:42,165 --> 01:01:44,135
<b>I was just about to leave.</b>

725
01:01:45,836 --> 01:01:47,536
<b>You have a girlfriend.</b>

726
01:01:47,905 --> 01:01:50,705
<b>Then he's just friends
with Bang Guk Bong?</b>

727
01:01:52,546 --> 01:01:54,046
<b>You're way too pleased.</b>

728
01:01:55,145 --> 01:01:56,145
<b>I am?</b>

729
01:01:58,016 --> 01:02:00,586
<b>Tell the guy that
he doesn't have to leave.</b>

730
01:02:01,086 --> 01:02:02,115
<b>What?</b>

731
01:02:03,185 --> 01:02:05,125
<b>Who's leaving?</b>

732
01:02:05,455 --> 01:02:06,885
<b>The guy you live with.</b>

733
01:02:08,256 --> 01:02:09,695
<b>He talked about leaving.</b>

734
01:02:10,595 --> 01:02:12,496
<b>You said you wouldn't leave.</b>

735
01:02:13,595 --> 01:02:16,236
<b>- What?
- You got a new global name,</b>

736
01:02:16,635 --> 01:02:18,635
<b>so you'll move abroad now?</b>

737
01:02:23,036 --> 01:02:24,306
<b>"Bang Cruise"?</b>

738
01:02:26,375 --> 01:02:27,476
<b>Hey.</b>

739
01:02:27,476 --> 01:02:31,645
<b>Do you even know that's
Tom Cruise's surname, not his name?</b>

740
01:02:32,115 --> 01:02:33,115
<b>I...</b>

741
01:02:41,296 --> 01:02:43,826
<b>- Someone's here.
- You are...</b>

742
01:02:46,026 --> 01:02:48,836
<b>Bang Guk Bong, whatever they say.</b>

743
01:02:50,365 --> 01:02:51,405
<b>I am?</b>

744
01:02:55,776 --> 01:02:56,875
<b>Can't you...</b>

745
01:02:59,175 --> 01:03:00,246
<b>just go on...</b>

746
01:03:01,276 --> 01:03:02,845
<b>being Bang Guk Bong?</b>

747
01:03:05,645 --> 01:03:07,915
<b>Can I do that?</b>

748
01:03:09,256 --> 01:03:10,855
<b>Can you...</b>

749
01:03:13,556 --> 01:03:14,655
<b>not leave?</b>

750
01:03:49,026 --> 01:03:50,125
<b>You.</b>

751
01:03:52,526 --> 01:03:53,625
<b>Who are you?</b>

752
01:04:19,385 --> 01:04:22,395
<b>(Welcome)</b>

753
01:04:22,395 --> 01:04:23,756
<b>He's just like a cat.</b>

754
01:04:23,756 --> 01:04:25,796
<b>He disappears and then appears.</b>

755
01:04:25,796 --> 01:04:28,536
<b>- Didn't you find it weird?
- He gets me.</b>

756
01:04:28,536 --> 01:04:30,296
<b>What are you really?</b>

757
01:04:30,595 --> 01:04:32,705
<b>I would stay with Sol Ah.</b>

758
01:04:32,705 --> 01:04:34,105
<b>Are you that close already?</b>

759
01:04:34,105 --> 01:04:35,236
<b>How do you know this?</b>

760
01:04:35,236 --> 01:04:37,006
<b>The first person I remember.</b>

761
01:04:37,135 --> 01:04:40,076
<b>Will you disappear suddenly
like a cat too?</b>

762
01:04:40,076 --> 01:04:41,216
<b>Why is it Sol Ah?</b>

763
01:04:41,675 --> 01:04:43,145
<b>I know only one thing.</b>

764
01:04:43,776 --> 01:04:46,216
<b>Sol Ah makes me human.</b>
