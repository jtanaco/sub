00:30:04,368 --> 00:30:05,739
<b>Network medicine...</b>

319
00:30:05,739 --> 00:30:08,599
<b>is a program that remembers each individual's medical history...</b>

320
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:10,309
<b>and classifies them...</b>

321
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:12,138
<b>according to psychological patterns to diagnose them.</b>

322
00:30:13,608 --> 00:30:14,608
<b>Kim Hoon?</b>

323
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:17,178
<b>It provides complete confidentiality...</b>

324
00:30:17,178 --> 00:30:20,148
<b>and uses big data to evaluate...</b>

325
00:30:20,148 --> 00:30:22,118
<b>I wonder what he does for a living.</b>

326
00:30:22,349 --> 00:30:23,718
<b>This is a flowchart.</b>

327
00:30:23,718 --> 00:30:25,458
<b>Record Kim Ji Soo saying a few things.</b>

328
00:30:25,489 --> 00:30:27,858
<b>Do you understand wanting a recording of someone's voice...</b>

329
00:30:27,918 --> 00:30:28,928
<b>because you miss them?</b>

330
00:30:28,928 --> 00:30:31,529
<b>Whether you cherish a photograph or a voice recording,</b>

331
00:30:31,858 --> 00:30:33,059
<b>I think it's the same.</b>

332
00:30:33,059 --> 00:30:34,099
<b>Her voice.</b>

333
00:30:34,858 --> 00:30:36,329
<b>Personal history.</b>

334
00:30:36,999 --> 00:30:39,398
<b>And Ha Won may be Moon Ha Won.</b>

335
00:30:39,398 --> 00:30:41,739
<b>This isn't just a simple recording.</b>

336
00:30:42,208 --> 00:30:44,438
<b>- Who are you? - Introduce yourself first.</b>

337
00:30:45,168 --> 00:30:46,638
<b>Then I'll explain the relationship.</b>

338
00:30:47,138 --> 00:30:48,178
<b>Where...</b>

339
00:30:48,779 --> 00:30:49,979
<b>are you right now?</b>

340
00:30:51,108 --> 00:30:52,378
<b>- Look for me. - Look for me.</b>

341
00:31:38,829 --> 00:31:39,958
<b>Are you going to the studio?</b>

342
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,029
<b>That's what this is, right?</b>

343
00:31:42,398 --> 00:31:44,029
<b>That's what this is, isn't it?</b>

344
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:49,408
<b>It was you, Ha Won, at the farm who told me to look for you.</b>

345
00:31:49,638 --> 00:31:51,468
<b>But Ha Won wasn't there. He wasn't,</b>

346
00:31:51,468 --> 00:31:54,279
<b>but I conversed with Ha Won's words and voice.</b>

347
00:31:54,908 --> 00:31:56,408
<b>How is that possible?</b>

348
00:31:57,608 --> 00:31:58,948
<b>Because you're Moon Ha Won.</b>

349
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:03,319
<b>That's why you needed Ji soo's voice, isn't it?</b>

350
00:32:08,388 --> 00:32:09,428
<b>Taxi.</b>

351
00:32:30,408 --> 00:32:31,448
<b>It's me.</b>

352
00:32:33,749 --> 00:32:35,118
<b>How have you been?</b>

353
00:32:38,148 --> 00:32:39,688
<b>You know that cafe, right?</b>

354
00:32:40,089 --> 00:32:41,458
<b>I left a flower there.</b>

355
00:32:41,688 --> 00:32:44,688
<b>I am well. I will look into the cafe.</b>

356
00:32:45,158 --> 00:32:46,698
<b>It's just Ji Soo's voice.</b>

357
00:32:47,628 --> 00:32:49,668
<b>The function is a conversation service that we know.</b>

358
00:32:50,599 --> 00:32:53,799
<b>You converted Ji Soo's life into data...</b>

359
00:32:54,368 --> 00:32:56,039
<b>and overlaid her voice on top of it.</b>

360
00:32:57,438 --> 00:32:58,569
<b>What were you imagining?</b>

361
00:32:58,739 --> 00:33:00,608
<b>A conversation with the real Ji Soo.</b>

362
00:33:08,349 --> 00:33:09,388
<b>What?</b>

363
00:33:09,618 --> 00:33:13,189
<b>I thought maybe you had some surveillance equipment.</b>

364
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:16,559
<b>- I don't even have heat here. - Isn't it cold?</b>

365
00:33:17,559 --> 00:33:19,599
<b>- It is. - But you're living here anyway?</b>

366
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:22,059
<b>It's so cold.</b>

367
00:33:24,129 --> 00:33:25,468
<b>I should buy a stove.</b>

368
00:33:25,638 --> 00:33:27,599
<b>You can just have the city turn on the gas.</b>

369
00:33:28,368 --> 00:33:29,769
<b>They'll come right away if you call them.</b>

370
00:33:31,468 --> 00:33:32,479
<b>I'll do that.</b>

371
00:33:36,849 --> 00:33:38,109
<b>It's the safest here.</b>

372
00:33:38,879 --> 00:33:40,048
<b>No one knows about this place.</b>

373
00:33:55,669 --> 00:33:57,698
<b>Can you tell me about when you saw her last?</b>

374
00:34:00,669 --> 00:34:04,068
<b>She came to the studio before she went to the airport.</b>

375
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:06,879
<b>She yelled at me...</b>

376
00:34:06,879 --> 00:34:09,349
<b>that day you two didn't meet.</b>

377
00:34:09,479 --> 00:34:10,879
<b>She must have felt bad.</b>

378
00:34:11,178 --> 00:34:12,948
<b>Ji Soo would never yell.</b>

379
00:34:12,948 --> 00:34:15,618
<b>I don't mean she cursed or raised her voice.</b>

380
00:34:15,948 --> 00:34:18,349
<b>She spoke at a higher tone than usual.</b>

381
00:34:19,258 --> 00:34:20,859
<b>You know this is hard for me to talk about.</b>

382
00:34:25,899 --> 00:34:27,959
<b>I heard you were the last person to speak to her.</b>

383
00:34:29,468 --> 00:34:31,468
<b>- Well... - I'm scared.</b>

384
00:34:37,309 --> 00:34:38,508
<b>Do you want something to drink?</b>

385
00:34:41,778 --> 00:34:43,579
<b>All I have are water and coffee.</b>

386
00:34:46,479 --> 00:34:48,419
<b>How do you live on that?</b>

387
00:34:48,948 --> 00:34:51,118
<b>You need to eat well when things are hard.</b>

388
00:34:51,118 --> 00:34:52,218
<b>It's too hard otherwise.</b>

389
00:34:56,229 --> 00:34:57,229
<b>If...</b>

390
00:34:59,198 --> 00:35:01,599
<b>we had met thanks to you,</b>

391
00:35:05,399 --> 00:35:06,968
<b>what do you think she would've said to me?</b>

392
00:35:18,678 --> 00:35:19,919
<b>If...</b>

393
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:24,189
<b>I mean, I know it's pointless to talk about ifs, but if by chance,</b>

394
00:35:24,388 --> 00:35:27,218
<b>you had met because of my nosiness,</b>

395
00:35:30,359 --> 00:35:32,658
<b>maybe she would've told you everything eating her up inside...</b>

396
00:35:33,028 --> 00:35:35,729
<b>and felt the burden lifted, and not gone to Norway.</b>

397
00:35:46,338 --> 00:35:47,778
<b>About her dishes.</b>

398
00:35:49,109 --> 00:35:51,249
<b>Whether you like them,</b>

399
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:54,749
<b>what you use them for, how good the food tastes out of them...</b>

400
00:35:55,379 --> 00:35:59,059
<b>Maybe she would've bragged about how pretty they were.</b>

401
00:35:59,758 --> 00:36:01,559
<b>Maybe...</b>

402
00:36:02,158 --> 00:36:05,229
<b>she would've asked why you chose Seo Woo of all people to buy them...</b>

403
00:36:05,559 --> 00:36:08,028
<b>and complimented you on having a good eye for people.</b>

404
00:36:14,968 --> 00:36:16,638
<b>I should use them well.</b>

405
00:36:22,278 --> 00:36:24,609
<b>She called me from Norway...</b>

406
00:36:25,379 --> 00:36:27,448
<b>and said she was glad she went.</b>

407
00:36:29,218 --> 00:36:31,349
<b>That being there, she wondered why she lived like that,</b>

408
00:36:31,349 --> 00:36:33,588
<b>and that it felt cathartic.</b>

409
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:36,258
<b>She said...</b>

410
00:36:37,158 --> 00:36:39,798
<b>it was a path you and she used to take together.</b>

411
00:36:43,669 --> 00:36:45,738
<b>- Na. - Nya.</b>

412
00:36:45,868 --> 00:36:47,899
<b>- Neo. - Nyeo.</b>

413
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:49,968
<b>- No. - Nyo.</b>

414
00:36:49,968 --> 00:36:51,109
<b>Noo.</b>

415
00:36:51,468 --> 00:36:53,838
<b>- Ga. - Gya.</b>

416
00:36:54,039 --> 00:36:56,448
<b>- Geo. - Gyeo.</b>

417
00:36:56,579 --> 00:36:58,749
<b>- Go. - Gyo.</b>

418
00:37:06,859 --> 00:37:08,888
<b>She said it was so nice,</b>

419
00:37:09,019 --> 00:37:10,959
<b>and that she was so happy,</b>

420
00:37:11,859 --> 00:37:14,999
<b>and that she thought she could be strong now.</b>

421
00:37:24,568 --> 00:37:26,008
<b>Ji Soo.</b>

422
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:29,379
<b>I'll just tell him that much.</b>

423
00:37:45,129 --> 00:37:46,928
<b>What's with the weather?</b>

424
00:37:47,229 --> 00:37:49,769
<b>It's dark, like it's nighttime.</b>

425
00:37:49,769 --> 00:37:52,028
<b>Today, it will be cloudy...</b>

426
00:37:52,028 --> 00:37:54,698
<b>and rain is expected.</b>

427
00:37:59,209 --> 00:38:00,609
<b>Ji Soo.</b>

428
00:38:00,838 --> 00:38:04,349
<b>Yes, I'm Kim Ji Soo. Please ask your question.</b>

429
00:38:10,548 --> 00:38:12,088
<b>Do you want to borrow it?</b>

430
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:17,059
<b>I can change the voice if it freaks you out.</b>

431
00:38:19,258 --> 00:38:20,499
<b>It's okay.</b>

432
00:38:20,499 --> 00:38:23,129
<b>It's still in the testing stage, so it doesn't come with earphones.</b>

433
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:26,039
<b>You can plug in any pair of earphones.</b>

434
00:38:26,769 --> 00:38:29,309
<b>The last time Ji Soo was at the studio...</b>

435
00:38:29,368 --> 00:38:30,809
<b>- Again... - No.</b>

436
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:32,508
<b>Didn't she bring something?</b>

437
00:38:33,178 --> 00:38:35,338
<b>It was still wrapped in the studio.</b>

438
00:38:41,379 --> 00:38:43,888
<b>Oh, no. I completely forgot.</b>

439
00:38:55,758 --> 00:38:57,669
<b>Oh, no.</b>

440
00:39:05,338 --> 00:39:08,439
<b>It's a picture I took in 2012 in Misiryeong.</b>

441
00:39:09,109 --> 00:39:11,879
<b>I've been carrying it with me ever since.</b>

442
00:39:12,749 --> 00:39:17,088
<b>I'm very glad I could give this to you.</b>

443
00:39:19,588 --> 00:39:21,689
<b>Please cherish it.</b>

444
00:39:24,189 --> 00:39:25,528
<b>Misiryeong.</b>

445
00:39:29,269 --> 00:39:31,169
<b>Year 2012.</b>

446
00:39:34,769 --> 00:39:38,769
<b>Ji Soo, thank you for the two gifts,</b>

447
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:40,738
<b>the picture and the plant.</b>

448
00:39:42,649 --> 00:39:44,349
<b>I'm doing well.</b>

449
00:39:46,948 --> 00:39:48,479
<b>Seo Woo is strong as an ox.</b>

450
00:39:48,479 --> 00:39:50,118
<b>This is nothing.</b>

451
00:39:50,249 --> 00:39:53,359
<b>I'm being appreciated more for this and that.</b>

452
00:39:54,258 --> 00:39:55,928
<b>And...</b>

453
00:39:59,059 --> 00:40:01,158
<b>a lot of fun things happened too.</b>

454
00:40:26,588 --> 00:40:29,758
<b>I want to tell you only happy things,</b>

455
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:34,198
<b>so I'm always looking for happy things in my life with a fine comb.</b>

456
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:39,769
<b>But the happiest thing in my life right now...</b>

457
00:40:40,868 --> 00:40:43,269
<b>I'll tell you about that later.</b>

458
00:40:44,539 --> 00:40:47,379
<b>How would it have been if we had gotten...</b>

459
00:40:47,939 --> 00:40:49,448
<b>to know each other better?</b>

460
00:40:50,678 --> 00:40:53,118
<b>It may be difficult to know right now,</b>

461
00:40:53,118 --> 00:40:54,979
<b>but let's learn slowly with time.</b>

462
00:40:55,048 --> 00:40:56,749
<b>Sure. Okay.</b>

463
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:02,059
<b>Do you know where this is?</b>

464
00:41:15,669 --> 00:41:17,238
<b>It's here.</b>

465
00:41:24,209 --> 00:41:28,649
<b>I was standing here, and Ji Soo walked up from there.</b>

466
00:41:32,859 --> 00:41:34,419
<b>Where do you live?</b>

467
00:41:34,459 --> 00:41:36,258
<b>Why do you want to know that?</b>

468
00:41:37,258 --> 00:41:38,959
<b>I need to know to figure out where Ji Soo was.</b>

469
00:41:38,959 --> 00:41:40,399
<b>That's silly.</b>

470
00:41:41,859 --> 00:41:43,729
<b>Why do you want to know?</b>

471
00:41:44,769 --> 00:41:46,039
<b>Right?</b>

472
00:41:46,568 --> 00:41:48,039
<b>I just do.</b>

473
00:41:53,109 --> 00:41:55,838
<b>Do you see that chair under the street lamp up there?</b>

474
00:41:56,379 --> 00:41:58,048
<b>If you go up toward the left,</b>

475
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:00,249
<b>it's the first house past the corner.</b>

476
00:42:00,249 --> 00:42:01,519
<b>I live in the semi-basement.</b>

477
00:42:09,218 --> 00:42:10,289
<b>(Homestay)</b>

478
00:42:52,499 --> 00:42:53,838
<b>She's gone.</b>

479
00:43:00,939 --> 00:43:01,939
<b>Why...</b>

480
00:43:02,678 --> 00:43:04,349
<b>did I hide?</b>

481
00:43:05,278 --> 00:43:07,678
<b>Your body probably reacted because there was a reason.</b>

482
00:43:24,868 --> 00:43:25,928
<b>Here.</b>

483
00:43:30,368 --> 00:43:33,278
<b>She took it on her way home after meeting you.</b>

484
00:43:35,209 --> 00:43:36,849
<b>What was she wearing?</b>

485
00:43:36,849 --> 00:43:37,948
<b>That too?</b>

486
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:40,079
<b>Yes. I want to know.</b>

487
00:43:44,349 --> 00:43:48,218
<b>She was wearing a dress coat and boots. Long boots.</b>

488
00:43:49,658 --> 00:43:51,859
<b>Ji Soo wore boots all the time.</b>

489
00:43:56,968 --> 00:44:00,468
<b>She was wearing tan leather gloves although it wasn't cold.</b>

490
00:44:05,269 --> 00:44:07,379
<b>Probably so the box wouldn't slip.</b>

491
00:44:07,379 --> 00:44:09,439
<b>Why do you want to know everything?</b>

492
00:44:12,948 --> 00:44:15,218
<b>This is how I miss her.</b>

493
00:45:09,499 --> 00:45:10,868
<b>Ji Soo.</b>

494
00:45:12,439 --> 00:45:17,379
<b>He wants to know everything about you.</b>

495
00:45:20,419 --> 00:45:21,879
<b>"I miss you."</b>

496
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:24,749
<b>"I love you. I like you."</b>

497
00:45:26,019 --> 00:45:27,919
<b>His one sentence incorporates them all.</b>

498
00:45:28,658 --> 00:45:29,988
<b>The sentence that's unique to him.</b>

499
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:33,329
<b>"I want to know."</b>

500
00:45:53,249 --> 00:45:54,349
<b>Come here.</b>

501
00:45:56,079 --> 00:45:57,118
<b>Next to you?</b>

502
00:46:14,868 --> 00:46:15,939
<b>It's coming.</b>

503
00:46:34,388 --> 00:46:35,488
<b>This is it.</b>

504
00:46:39,658 --> 00:46:41,459
<b>You're right. This is it.</b>

505
00:46:45,269 --> 00:46:47,298
<b>We watched this ever since we were kids.</b>

506
00:47:26,879 --> 00:47:29,749
<b>I don't know what it is exactly.</b>

507
00:47:30,979 --> 00:47:33,349
<b>I'm only telling you, Ji Soo.</b>

508
00:47:38,118 --> 00:47:40,459
<b>I really like looking...</b>

509
00:47:41,289 --> 00:47:42,388
<b>at him.</b>

510
00:47:43,758 --> 00:47:45,959
<b>He wants to be where you were,</b>

511
00:47:46,829 --> 00:47:49,158
<b>hear what you heard,</b>

512
00:47:50,169 --> 00:47:53,138
<b>and feel what you felt.</b>

513
00:47:54,638 --> 00:47:56,838
<b>I really like looking at him like this.</b>

514
00:48:00,539 --> 00:48:03,379
<b>I'm entranced by how he looks when he wants to know you more.</b>

515
00:48:03,849 --> 00:48:04,979
<b>I don't know what this is.</b>

516
00:48:07,678 --> 00:48:08,919
<b>It's an unrequited love.</b>

517
00:48:17,158 --> 00:48:18,189
<b>What was that?</b>

518
00:48:18,959 --> 00:48:20,359
<b>It's an unrequited love.</b>

519
00:48:25,207 --> 00:48:26,546
<b>It's an unrequited love.</b>

520
00:48:36,187 --> 00:48:37,256
<b>What was that?</b>

521
00:48:38,426 --> 00:48:39,856
<b>It's an unrequited love.</b>

522
00:48:50,336 --> 00:48:53,636
<b>How could you fall for him missing me of all things?</b>

523
00:48:54,207 --> 00:48:55,807
<b>Seo Woo, you are so...</b>

524
00:48:59,077 --> 00:49:00,247
<b>Why are you so jumpy?</b>

525
00:49:03,586 --> 00:49:04,847
<b>Who's this?</b>

526
00:49:09,316 --> 00:49:11,787
<b>Oh, no. You're not looking too well, are you?</b>

527
00:49:11,787 --> 00:49:13,457
<b>- Is it dead? - Is the eucalyptus dead?</b>

528
00:49:13,457 --> 00:49:14,796
<b>- No. - What?</b>

529
00:49:14,796 --> 00:49:17,667
<b>- No. I mean... The euca... - That's right.</b>

530
00:49:17,667 --> 00:49:20,997
<b>Our poor Calyp is dying. They're finicky.</b>

531
00:49:20,997 --> 00:49:22,497
<b>Will it live if I water it now?</b>

532
00:49:22,497 --> 00:49:24,867
<b>You should've watered it right away. Save it.</b>

533
00:49:25,037 --> 00:49:26,236
<b>What do you keep saying?</b>

534
00:49:26,236 --> 00:49:28,276
<b>I mean, please save it.</b>

535
00:49:32,477 --> 00:49:34,776
<b>My gosh. You poor thing.</b>

536
00:49:37,747 --> 00:49:38,847
<b>Smell it.</b>

537
00:49:39,486 --> 00:49:41,756
<b>This is its scent. How nice is that?</b>

538
00:49:44,457 --> 00:49:46,057
<b>Can you tell whether or not it's alive by touching it?</b>

539
00:49:46,057 --> 00:49:47,127
<b>Of course.</b>

540
00:49:47,127 --> 00:49:50,267
<b>They make it so obvious when they're begging for water.</b>

541
00:49:50,426 --> 00:49:51,667
<b>You know the term "withering away"?</b>

542
00:49:51,897 --> 00:49:54,836
<b>That's what it's saying now. Imagine how painful it is.</b>

543
00:49:55,796 --> 00:49:57,807
<b>Oh, no. Please save it.</b>

544
00:49:58,606 --> 00:50:01,276
<b>When did you buy this? I never saw it before.</b>

545
00:50:01,506 --> 00:50:03,906
<b>It was a gift, but I completely forgot.</b>

546
00:50:04,176 --> 00:50:05,247
<b>What should I do?</b>

547
00:50:06,147 --> 00:50:07,977
<b>Okay, let's save it.</b>

548
00:50:08,147 --> 00:50:09,776
<b>Is it possible? Can we save it?</b>

549
00:50:10,247 --> 00:50:13,356
<b>That's how they are. They survive even with a tiny speck of love.</b>

550
00:50:13,856 --> 00:50:15,957
<b>They don't let your efforts go to waste.</b>

551
00:50:16,316 --> 00:50:17,727
<b>That's why I adore them.</b>

552
00:50:18,227 --> 00:50:19,627
<b>Let's do all we can.</b>

553
00:50:53,256 --> 00:50:54,557
<b>I barely touched you.</b>

554
00:50:54,957 --> 00:50:56,667
<b>Ji Soo asked me to save it.</b>

555
00:50:59,526 --> 00:51:02,296
<b>That eu... Eucal... That...</b>

556
00:51:05,466 --> 00:51:09,336
<b>So, you lent it to me to make me keep talking to her.</b>

557
00:51:09,336 --> 00:51:11,776
<b>- I brought her out. - I wasn't expecting much.</b>

558
00:51:11,776 --> 00:51:14,617
<b>You probably didn't expect me to chat with her everywhere I went.</b>

559
00:51:16,577 --> 00:51:18,886
<b>Think hard about what you said that made her come out.</b>

560
00:51:19,086 --> 00:51:22,617
<b>I was talking to Ji Soo, wasn't I? That's what this is, isn't it?</b>

561
00:51:25,687 --> 00:51:28,497
<b>Can you tell me the details of where and how...</b>

562
00:51:28,497 --> 00:51:29,856
<b>Ji Soo came out?</b>

563
00:51:30,227 --> 00:51:33,167
<b>- What you talked about... - So that's what this is.</b>

564
00:51:34,196 --> 00:51:35,437
<b>It isn't Ji Soo.</b>

565
00:51:36,466 --> 00:51:39,307
<b>It's a conversation device with Ji Soo's character and emotions.</b>

566
00:51:39,307 --> 00:51:41,037
<b>Why... Why did you make this?</b>

567
00:51:41,276 --> 00:51:42,506
<b>It has many uses.</b>

568
00:51:43,446 --> 00:51:45,807
<b>It can provide psychiatric therapy,</b>

569
00:51:45,807 --> 00:51:47,077
<b>prevent dementia,</b>

570
00:51:47,077 --> 00:51:50,147
<b>and you can talk to the person you want at any time for treatment.</b>

571
00:51:50,917 --> 00:51:52,086
<b>It's for treatment.</b>

572
00:51:52,586 --> 00:51:54,656
<b>Who is this one treating?</b>

573
00:51:57,086 --> 00:51:58,827
<b>It's a procedural test.</b>

574
00:51:59,287 --> 00:52:00,327
<b>And...</b>

575
00:52:01,296 --> 00:52:04,066
<b>it helps me at least.</b>

576
00:52:10,066 --> 00:52:12,207
<b>Where did she react to you?</b>

577
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:17,207
<b>- In the studio. - It's an unrequited love.</b>

578
00:52:18,577 --> 00:52:20,347
<b>What did she say?</b>

579
00:52:21,446 --> 00:52:22,617
<b>I can't remember.</b>

580
00:52:27,086 --> 00:52:28,256
<b>Not there.</b>

581
00:52:29,187 --> 00:52:30,227
<b>Here.</b>

582
00:52:35,696 --> 00:52:38,167
<b>Do that with your hand.</b>

583
00:52:47,236 --> 00:52:49,106
<b>Feel your pulse there, and concentrate.</b>

584
00:52:57,386 --> 00:52:59,617
<b>- It's an unrequited love. - So...</b>

585
00:53:01,287 --> 00:53:03,216
<b>why do you want to know that?</b>

586
00:53:07,327 --> 00:53:09,656
<b>It's the SA node principle. The heart rate principle.</b>

587
00:53:09,997 --> 00:53:12,127
<b>One spot brought about everything.</b>

588
00:53:12,127 --> 00:53:15,437
<b>One decisive puzzle piece made Ji Soo come together.</b>

589
00:53:17,707 --> 00:53:20,276
<b>If you keep talking to it, it'll find her on its own.</b>

590
00:53:20,836 --> 00:53:22,437
<b>We call it the point of reaction.</b>

591
00:53:23,877 --> 00:53:25,477
<b>What was that...</b>

592
00:53:26,176 --> 00:53:29,017
<b>If you explain what you were talking about,</b>

593
00:53:29,546 --> 00:53:30,886
<b>I can extrapolate.</b>

594
00:53:32,816 --> 00:53:36,716
<b>I was talking about this and that in the studio, and she came out.</b>

595
00:53:36,716 --> 00:53:37,856
<b>This and that? What?</b>

596
00:53:38,057 --> 00:53:41,026
<b>Just... This and that. Mostly about me and my feelings.</b>

597
00:53:41,426 --> 00:53:42,827
<b>I can't tell you that.</b>

598
00:53:54,736 --> 00:53:56,377
<b>What kind of feelings?</b>

599
00:53:58,347 --> 00:54:01,446
<b>There's something only Ji Soo and I talked about.</b>

600
00:54:01,446 --> 00:54:03,687
<b>It was a continuation of something we've been talking about.</b>

601
00:54:04,546 --> 00:54:07,156
<b>I said I was like this, so...</b>

602
00:54:07,156 --> 00:54:09,486
<b>I really like looking at him like this.</b>

603
00:54:09,486 --> 00:54:11,386
<b>I said I feel this and that because of this and that...</b>

604
00:54:11,386 --> 00:54:14,557
<b>I'm entranced by how he looks when he wants to know you more.</b>

605
00:54:14,557 --> 00:54:16,227
<b>- It's an unrequited love. - So she said it's that.</b>

606
00:54:16,597 --> 00:54:19,127
<b>You said you feel this and that...</b>

607
00:54:19,897 --> 00:54:21,267
<b>because of this and that...</b>

608
00:54:21,796 --> 00:54:24,707
<b>so she said it's... It's what?</b>

609
00:54:25,037 --> 00:54:28,506
<b>She said it's such-and-such. She gave me a clear diagnosis.</b>

610
00:54:28,977 --> 00:54:30,276
<b>She said it's such-and-such.</b>

611
00:54:31,247 --> 00:54:32,506
<b>Three words.</b>

612
00:54:32,776 --> 00:54:35,617
<b>- How was the weather? - Average.</b>

613
00:54:36,886 --> 00:54:38,417
<b>You really wrote that.</b>

614
00:54:38,417 --> 00:54:39,986
<b>Why are you writing that?</b>

615
00:54:40,017 --> 00:54:41,417
<b>Why do you want to know the point of reaction?</b>

616
00:54:41,457 --> 00:54:43,287
<b>Ji Soo came out. That's what matters.</b>

617
00:54:47,856 --> 00:54:49,627
<b>I wondered if it was because of me.</b>

618
00:54:52,696 --> 00:54:53,867
<b>Because...</b>

619
00:54:55,966 --> 00:54:58,167
<b>Ji Soo was the decisive element for me.</b>

620
00:55:00,037 --> 00:55:02,006
<b>The thunder is so loud.</b>

621
00:55:02,176 --> 00:55:05,176
<b>Four o'clock in the afternoon. It's daytime, but it's dark.</b>

622
00:55:05,247 --> 00:55:07,316
<b>Norway. Oslo.</b>

623
00:55:07,776 --> 00:55:10,787
<b>The forest on the way home from school. Dark afternoons.</b>

624
00:55:11,446 --> 00:55:12,687
<b>Do you remember?</b>

625
00:55:15,457 --> 00:55:17,227
<b>Ji Soo used to get scared.</b>

626
00:55:19,386 --> 00:55:21,156
<b>I wondered if I was...</b>

627
00:55:22,127 --> 00:55:24,127
<b>the reason for Ji Soo too.</b>

628
00:55:35,377 --> 00:55:36,606
<b>I wonder...</b>

629
00:55:37,147 --> 00:55:39,847
<b>if I mentioned the name Ha Won.</b>

630
00:55:42,716 --> 00:55:45,486
<b>Ji Soo was the thunder and lightning. Do you get it?</b>

631
00:55:46,247 --> 00:55:48,316
<b>There are things we knew since we were young.</b>

632
00:55:48,886 --> 00:55:50,457
<b>No one else knows.</b>

633
00:55:50,486 --> 00:55:53,926
<b>I may have been in a word you said without thinking.</b>

634
00:55:55,856 --> 00:55:58,026
<b>If you tell me what you spoke to her about,</b>

635
00:55:58,026 --> 00:55:59,267
<b>I will interpret it.</b>

636
00:56:02,867 --> 00:56:04,437
<b>Then...</b>

637
00:56:05,667 --> 00:56:09,636
<b>if it really was you that drew her out,</b>

638
00:56:10,776 --> 00:56:12,776
<b>if you confirm that,</b>

639
00:56:13,977 --> 00:56:15,747
<b>can you forget her?</b>

640
00:56:17,486 --> 00:56:19,086
<b>Why must I forget her?</b>

641
00:56:48,276 --> 00:56:49,546
<b>Ji Soo.</b>

642
00:57:05,526 --> 00:57:07,537
<b>Her emotions...</b>

643
00:57:09,167 --> 00:57:10,437
<b>and character.</b>

644
00:57:10,437 --> 00:57:12,667
<b>I can't see him.</b>

645
00:57:17,776 --> 00:57:20,006
<b>There's no way she'll come out.</b>

646
00:57:31,026 --> 00:57:32,327
<b>It's me.</b>

647
00:57:35,696 --> 00:57:38,566
<b>Knock, knock, knock, knock.</b>

648
00:57:38,696 --> 00:57:40,796
<b>Knock, knock.</b>

649
00:57:40,796 --> 00:57:42,336
<b>Seo Woo, are you alone?</b>

650
00:57:49,176 --> 00:57:52,276
<b>How's the eucalyptus plant? Can you save it?</b>

651
00:57:53,877 --> 00:57:57,287
<b>Of course. I can save it.</b>

652
00:57:57,716 --> 00:57:59,847
<b>That place must not have any furniture.</b>

653
00:58:00,656 --> 00:58:02,256
<b>How did you know?</b>

654
00:58:02,256 --> 00:58:04,057
<b>The sound is echoing.</b>

655
00:58:04,057 --> 00:58:05,886
<b>Like you're in an empty room.</b>

656
00:58:07,256 --> 00:58:10,356
<b>I came early, and it's empty.</b>

657
00:58:10,966 --> 00:58:14,997
<b>Ji Soo, you sound cheerful. It sounds different.</b>

658
00:58:15,867 --> 00:58:17,807
<b>I'm usually cheerful.</b>

659
00:58:18,566 --> 00:58:20,606
<b>I liked the studio.</b>

660
00:58:21,336 --> 00:58:23,377
<b>The sound is cozier there.</b>

661
00:58:23,776 --> 00:58:26,077
<b>It's a good place to share secrets.</b>

662
00:58:26,077 --> 00:58:28,216
<b>I liked your story too.</b>

663
00:58:29,517 --> 00:58:33,117
<b>What about me? I think I'm getting a call.</b>

664
00:58:33,886 --> 00:58:35,986
<b>I have a call. I can't talk anymore.</b>

665
00:58:35,986 --> 00:58:37,526
<b>- I... - About Misiryeong.</b>

666
00:58:43,227 --> 00:58:45,597
<b>Everyone makes mistakes.</b>

667
00:58:46,597 --> 00:58:48,667
<b>Even nature makes mistakes.</b>

668
00:58:50,136 --> 00:58:51,867
<b>My parents...</b>

669
00:58:53,267 --> 00:58:56,106
<b>died in a forest fire.</b>

670
00:58:58,176 --> 00:59:00,977
<b>I don't usually tell people this.</b>

671
00:59:02,347 --> 00:59:06,287
<b>I didn't know who to hate and resent.</b>

672
00:59:07,457 --> 00:59:09,057
<b>For a while,</b>

673
00:59:09,716 --> 00:59:11,656
<b>I was miserable because of that.</b>

674
00:59:14,227 --> 00:59:16,156
<b>And then for a while,</b>

675
00:59:17,426 --> 00:59:21,037
<b>I was miserable that I survived by myself.</b>

676
00:59:26,667 --> 00:59:27,877
<b>And now,</b>

677
00:59:28,577 --> 00:59:30,577
<b>I just live day by day.</b>

678
00:59:33,276 --> 00:59:34,647
<b>Today...</b>

679
00:59:35,446 --> 00:59:38,287
<b>It's Mom's favorite season.</b>

680
00:59:39,886 --> 00:59:41,356
<b>Now...</b>

681
00:59:42,057 --> 00:59:44,586
<b>It's the afternoon, Dad's favorite time of the day.</b>

682
00:59:46,057 --> 00:59:48,127
<b>I should cherish it all.</b>

683
00:59:57,966 --> 01:00:00,167
<b>Even nature makes mistakes.</b>

684
01:00:01,276 --> 01:00:04,106
<b>It's okay. It's nothing.</b>

685
01:00:07,977 --> 01:00:10,216
<b>Why are you suddenly bringing that up?</b>

686
01:00:19,426 --> 01:00:21,327
<b>Do you remember what you said?</b>

687
01:00:21,397 --> 01:00:24,497
<b>That you thought I had already met Ha Won.</b>

688
01:00:24,667 --> 01:00:26,897
<b>- Yes. - You were right.</b>

689
01:00:27,167 --> 01:00:29,236
<b>It was someone I knew.</b>

690
01:00:29,236 --> 01:00:33,406
<b>It was that person who rents the studio early in the morning.</b>

691
01:00:33,406 --> 01:00:35,877
<b>I thought so. And?</b>

692
01:00:45,486 --> 01:00:47,287
<b>Do you...</b>

693
01:00:50,957 --> 01:00:53,957
<b>want to try talking to Ha Won?</b>

694
01:01:32,497 --> 01:01:34,636
<b>(A Piece of Your Mind)</b>

695
01:01:34,867 --> 01:01:36,767
<b>It's all you.</b>

696
01:01:36,767 --> 01:01:38,906
<b>You're curious and imagine.</b>

697
01:01:38,906 --> 01:01:41,906
<b>This is nice. This is what an unrequited love is all about.</b>

698
01:01:41,906 --> 01:01:43,077
<b>Sneaking peeks.</b>

699
01:01:43,077 --> 01:01:45,906
<b>Why did two residents move out at the same time?</b>

700
01:01:46,077 --> 01:01:47,647
<b>Give her the room at the end.</b>

701
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:51,716
<b>It's like the two of them were their only friend and family...</b>

702
01:01:51,716 --> 01:01:53,046
<b>Are you okay?</b>

703
01:01:53,247 --> 01:01:54,986
<b>I really wanted to see you.</b>

704
01:01:54,986 --> 01:01:56,687
<b>- At this hour? - All the time.</b>

705
01:01:56,687 --> 01:01:57,687
<b>All the time?</b>

706
01:01:57,687 --> 01:01:59,026
<b>Does Won know?</b>
