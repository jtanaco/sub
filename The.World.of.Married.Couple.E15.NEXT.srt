{b}although it was only for a short moment.

00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:35,930
{b}I feel sorry for him.

162
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:44,540
{b}I won't let...

163
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,840
{b}Jenny become like Joon Young.

164
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,410
{b}I'm not like that woman.

165
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:55,950
{b}I don't want to act crazy and hit rock bottom.

166
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:57,920
{b}I know I can overcome this.

167
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,090
{b}I'll make sure to overcome it even if just for Jenny.

168
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:06,760
{b}I'll get through it...

169
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:09,760
{b}with you.

170
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,030
{b}Da Kyung.

171
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,110
{b}But give me some time.

172
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:28,080
{b}- I need time.
- Okay.

173
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:30,850
{b}Take as much as you need.

174
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:34,420
{b}Take your time.

175
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:36,990
{b}I'll wait.

176
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,990
{b}Also, I'll try my best too.

177
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:48,600
{b}Eat your breakfast.

178
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:06,650
{b}Thank you.

179
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,330
{b}The soup is delicious.

180
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:22,930
{b}Good.

181
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:25,770
{b}Enjoy it.

182
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,890
{b}I'm going to check up on Jenny.

183
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,290
{b}Okay.

184
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:02,070
{b}Come here.

185
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,450
{b}Jenny.

186
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:15,690
{b}I'll see you after work.

187
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,590
{b}I'll see you.

188
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:24,230
{b}Okay.

189
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:25,360
{b}I don't want to meet him.

190
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:45,640
{b}Stay in your room.

191
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,320
{b}Where's Joon Young?

192
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:56,920
{b}Tell me what you need to say. I'll make sure to let him know.

193
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:59,660
{b}I'm here to apologize. I want to do it face to face.

194
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:01,830
{b}He doesn't want to see you.

195
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:05,500
{b}Joon Young.

196
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,260
{b}Joon Young!

197
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:09,830
{b}What are you doing? I said he doesn't want to see you.

198
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:11,640
{b}Joon Young!

199
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,940
{b}Just leave!

200
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,670
{b}He doesn't want to meet you. He doesn't even want to talk to you.

201
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:15,910
{b}He's scared of you right now.

202
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:23,050
{b}I'm sorry.

203
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,750
{b}I'm sorry I hit you.

204
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:28,820
{b}I apologize.

205
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:31,090
{b}Can we please talk?

206
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,160
{b}I didn't hit you out of hatred.

207
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,430
{b}- I was just really angry...
- Leave.

208
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,700
{b}Let's at least clear the air between us.

209
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,300
{b}Don't you want to do that?

210
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,200
{b}If you don't leave, I'm going to call the cops.

211
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:07,160
{b}You should go now. Stop bothering him.

212
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:16,670
{b}It's over now! Just go!

213
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:40,090
{b}- Was everything part of your plan?
- What?

214
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:44,190
{b}- What are you talking about?
- Why did you tell Da Kyung?

215
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,630
{b}You said we should keep it a secret! You said that yourself!

216
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:49,970
{b}Do you still have feelings for me?

217
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:51,640
{b}I did what you asked.

218
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,470
{b}I gave up everything and backed down.

219
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:57,940
{b}All I asked of you was to make sure Joon Young didn't get hurt.

220
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,940
{b}You promised to raise him well.

221
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,510
{b}You said you'll make him happy.

222
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,020
{b}But how dare you hit my son in front of her and her family?

223
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,120
{b}So what?

224
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,460
{b}Did you tell her to get back at me?

225
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,730
{b}Do you really want to take this even further?

226
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:18,700
{b}Are you scared she might leave you?

227
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:24,270
{b}Da Kyung is nothing like you.

228
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:27,000
{b}She's willing to forgive me for the mistake I made.

229
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,040
{b}Too bad, right? You must be disappointed.

230
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,310
{b}Do you really think...

231
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:36,350
{b}she'll be able to forgive you?

232
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,780
{b}Do you really think...

233
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:43,850
{b}she'll be any different?

234
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,290
{b}Don't even think for a second that Joon Young likes you.

235
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:52,260
{b}He's just being like that because he's angry at me.

236
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,370
{b}I'm never going to give him up.

237
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,040
{b}This is your last warning.

238
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:09,910
{b}Give up on Joon Young and end the fight here and now.

239
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:12,750
{b}Otherwise, I won't stay still.

240
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:15,450
{b}I swear I will put an end to you.

241
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:17,550
{b}I will completely destroy your life.

242
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,060
{b}No, you just destroyed your own life.

243
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,630
{b}You tried to get back at me with that one-night mistake,

244
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:25,730
{b}but you only got humiliated.

245
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,530
{b}Do you still not know your place?

246
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,470
{b}What can you do to me?

247
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:30,970
{b}What are you going to do?

248
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:36,470
{b}I will never let an insane woman like you raise Joon Young.

249
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,110
{b}I'm going to take him back as soon as possible.

250
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,740
{b}So keep that in mind.

251
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,050
{b}What if Dad comes back?

252
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:18,950
{b}What if he tries to take me away?

253
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:23,750
{b}Don't worry. Your dad will never be able to bother you again.

254
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,190
{b}I told you I'll protect you.

255
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,440
{b}Can I help you?

256
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:19,010
{b}Tell Chairman Yeo...

257
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:23,750
{b}that I'd like to meet him.

258
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,670
{b}How long are you going to keep a tail on me?

259
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:32,340
{b}Or did you put a tail Tae Oh?

260
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:35,580
{b}I'm sure I made myself clear that I'll do anything...

261
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,610
{b}to make sure my daughter is happy.

262
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:43,680
{b}I guess that means you finally admit that your daughter is unhappy.

263
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:49,060
{b}What did you say to my daughter last night?

264
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:52,560
{b}You mean you want to know what happened...

265
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:56,730
{b}between me and Tae Oh.

266
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:02,570
{b}I knew a long time ago that you didn't trust Tae Oh.

267
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,240
{b}So I'm sure you can already guess what happened.

268
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:13,680
{b}What was...

269
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:18,350
{b}Da Kyung's dream?

270
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:26,830
{b}My daughter...

271
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:32,600
{b}liked to travel ever since she was young.

272
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:34,970
{b}So I took her to many different places.

273
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,710
{b}She especially enjoyed going to art galleries.

274
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:46,410
{b}Come to think of it, it was nice then.

275
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:51,520
{b}She had said she wanted to gain more experience and develop...

276
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:53,850
{b}a better eye for art,

277
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:57,820
{b}and then operate an art gallery.

278
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,360
{b}You are...

279
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:03,860
{b}more than capable of making that come true if she wanted.

280
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:06,970
{b}Naturally.

281
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,370
{b}She could've lived up to her potential and lived freely.

282
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:16,940
{b}She was held back unexpectedly by Tae Oh.

283
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:25,050
{b}Your precious daughter is wasting her youth...

284
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,150
{b}because of a man.

285
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:30,460
{b}Isn't that tragic?

286
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:36,030
{b}Seeing her struggling with her second-wife complex...

287
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:38,670
{b}makes me pity her...

288
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:41,370
{b}as a fellow woman.

289
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:49,910
{b}That's why I came here today, knowing I'm not welcome.

290
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,810
{b}Since you'd do anything...

291
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:59,520
{b}for your daughter.

292
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,290
{b}Da Kyung, it's Mom.

293
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,760
{b}- Are you okay?
- Yes.

294
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,760
{b}Of course, I'm okay. Everything's fine.

295
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,300
{b}Why did you call?

296
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:48,100
{b}I think Ji Sun Woo really did leave.

297
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:51,870
{b}The real estate agent said her house is up for sale.

298
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,770
{b}She packed up her things and left with her kid,

299
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,440
{b}so you don't have to worry anymore.

300
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,300
{b}Are we doing the right thing?

301
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,580
{b}Where are you moving to?

302
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:43,660
{b}Return them to the kids.

303
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:53,100
{b}Tell them I'm sorry...

304
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,940
{b}for me.

305
00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:00,540
{b}I'm sorry to you too.

306
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:09,180
{b}Sorry for asking you to do this.

307
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,780
{b}Joon Young.

308
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,960
{b}It was because I liked you.

309
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:19,990
{b}Because I was worried.

310
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,700
{b}It was because I wished you'd stop.

311
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,270
{b}I wasn't being holier-than-thou.

312
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,070
{b}So...

313
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,310
{b}I'm sorry if I offended you.

314
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:35,580
{b}I'm sorry too.

315
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:43,280
{b}Thanks.

316
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:14,380
{b}Shall we go?

317
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:16,620
{b}Okay.

318
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,600
{b}It's empty.

319
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:14,640
{b}- Hello.
- Hello, sir.

320
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,410
{b}Many of Dr. Ji's patients left,

321
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:18,950
{b}so it's a bit empty.

322
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:22,320
{b}Did Dr. Ji say when she's coming back?

323
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:24,650
{b}No.

324
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:28,550
{b}Dr. Sul says she thinks she left.

325
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:30,920
{b}She left? Completely?

326
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,060
{\c&H80FFFF&\b1}(Tae Oh){\c}

327
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,630
{b}What happened between you guys?

328
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:36,160
{b}Sun Woo said she and Joon Young left.

329
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,560
{b}Is that true?

330
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,300
{\c&H80FFFF&\b1}(Sun Woo said she and Joon Young left. Is that true?){\c}

331
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:47,970
{b}I'm sure you thought hard about it before making your decision.

332
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:50,910
{b}I just...

333
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:55,950
{b}want you to be happy.

334
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:59,520
{b}I wanted to tell you that.

335
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:12,470
{b}Your message has been saved.

336
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:27,580
{b}It's strong and sturdy.

337
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,550
{b}It was maintained nicely too. Come in.

338
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:36,120
{b}The owner left very suddenly,

339
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:39,530
{b}so the furniture is still here.

340
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:41,630
{b}Take a slow look around.

341
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:44,400
{b}Okay.

342
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,080
{b}Are you with the real estate agency?

343
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,190
{b}Is someone looking at the house?

344
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:16,620
{b}Yes. She's looking upstairs.

345
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:20,830
{b}When do you think our house will sell?

346
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:24,360
{b}I can't say. The market has been slow lately.

347
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:28,170
{b}It's not like we can drop the price that much. I'm worried.

348
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:30,570
{b}I'm sure there will be a buyer soon.

349
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:34,140
{b}Every house has an owner meant for it.

350
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,940
{b}Da Kyung?

351
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,620
{b}What brings you here?

352
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,550
{b}Do you know each other?

353
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:50,660
{b}Do you mind if we chat? You can go ahead.

354
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:52,290
{b}Sure.

355
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:57,900
{b}Think it over and give me a call.

356
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,970
{b}Sun Woo gave me a key and asked me to pack up her things.

357
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,610
{b}I didn't expect to see you here.

358
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,350
{b}I just wanted to confirm that she really did leave.

359
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,780
{b}That isn't all...

360
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,190
{b}that you want to confirm.

361
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:24,360
{b}Aren't you anxious because you're not sure if it's really over...

362
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,030
{b}between them?

363
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:31,760
{b}I understand. I'd be the same way.

364
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:36,000
{b}I'll let you get to work.

365
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:38,640
{b}Tae Oh won't...

366
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,970
{b}get over Sun Woo so easily.

367
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:49,280
{b}Sun Woo ran away like she did because she knows this.

368
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,950
{b}On what grounds are you making such claims?

369
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:57,120
{b}Did Sun Woo tell you to say this to me?

370
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,660
{b}I guess she did.

371
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:05,730
{b}I thought so.

372
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:08,670
{b}Je Hyuk said this to me.

373
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:12,940
{b}Even when a man has a woman beside him,

374
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:15,610
{b}he won't be able to get over his previous love.

375
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,580
{b}He thinks Tae Oh is like that.

376
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:21,950
{b}You know Sun Woo went into hiding once, right?

377
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,280
{b}Tae Oh came to see me then.

378
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:27,490
{b}He asked me if I could check on her well-being for him.

379
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,660
{b}His eyes looked so desperate.

380
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:35,590
{b}Why do you think Tae Oh acted that way?

381
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:42,200
{b}I know very well how torturous it is to live...

382
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:46,570
{b}while doubting your husband.

383
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:52,240
{b}That's why I wanted to tell you as another woman...

384
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:54,810
{b}and as someone with experience.

385
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:03,360
{b}If you don't believe me, you can come to my house.

386
00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:05,190
{b}I'll show you some security footage.

387
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:09,760
{b}She forwarded me her login for the security company.

388
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,930
{b}You'll be able to see how often Tae Oh came...

389
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:18,870
{b}and how many times he wandered around the empty house.

390
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:40,790
{b}- Thank you.
- Thank you.

391
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:35,410
{b}Let's consider this a trip.

392
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:41,250
{b}Let's not think about anything for a while and just relax.

393
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:44,460
{b}I feel strange.

394
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:50,600
{b}It's because the place is unfamiliar.

395
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:52,300
{b}You'll get used to it soon.

396
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,770
{b}Don't worry about anything and just have positive thoughts.

397
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:59,710
{b}Just choose where you want to go and what you want to do.

398
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:01,170
{b}I'll do everything for you.

399
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,250
{b}We can even go back if you want to.

400
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:30,700
{b}I wrapped up all the urgent projects at work.

401
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,670
{b}Should we go on a trip?

402
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:35,210
{b}Where to?

403
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:37,740
{b}You shouldn't overwork yourself,

404
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:40,050
{b}so how about somewhere warm to recuperate?

405
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:42,180
{b}Maybe Bali or Hawaii?

406
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,180
{b}How's Hawaii?

407
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:47,190
{b}Okay.

408
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:50,960
{b}I can go anytime, so you should pick the dates that work for you.

409
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,260
{b}Great.

410
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:45,280
{b}I'm sorry.

411
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:48,580
{b}Can I...

412
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:51,920
{b}sleepover tonight?

413
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:01,660
{b}Another time.

414
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:10,140
{b}I'm sorry. I went too far.

415
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:13,610
{b}I'm so bad at reading the mood.

416
00:45:15,070 --> 00:45:16,140
{b}Gosh.

417
00:45:20,410 --> 00:45:21,650
{b}I didn't upset you, did I?

418
00:46:22,610 --> 00:46:25,240
{b}- I'm home.
- Hey.

419
00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:30,380
{b}Where's Jenny?

420
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,050
{b}She's asleep.

421
00:46:39,790 --> 00:46:41,130
{b}Nothing happened, right?

422
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,060
{b}No.

423
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:49,170
{b}I'm going to make some ramyeon. Do you want to eat with me?

424
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:51,000
{b}I'm okay.

425
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:52,700
{b}Okay, then.

426
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,340
{b}Thank you.

427
00:48:31,570 --> 00:48:33,510
{b}Do you really not care where we go?

428
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,940
{b}Every school is the same.

429
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:41,380
{b}Your hospital is more important.

430
00:48:44,350 --> 00:48:46,450
{b}Should we look for a place in Seoul while we're at it?

431
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:50,090
{b}We should think about your university too.

432
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,230
{b}You should meet someone else too.

433
00:48:56,090 --> 00:48:57,600
{b}You should date someone nice.

434
00:48:58,430 --> 00:48:59,670
{b}I'm okay with it.

435
00:49:05,070 --> 00:49:07,370
{b}Why did you dislike Dr. Kim Yoon Ki?

436
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:08,840
{b}Because you were too good for him.

437
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,740
{b}- What?
- I mean it.

438
00:49:12,510 --> 00:49:13,610
{b}He's not good enough for you.

439

{b}I'm sorry.

445
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:56,560
{b}I left without saying goodbye.

446

{b}I know I shouldn't feel this way.

{b}He's a lot calmer.

451
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:16,070
{b}We even laughed together.

452
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:21,880
{b}The kids told me they understand and that you don't need to be sorry.

{b}Can't you just stay?

463
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,930
{b}Can you tell me once you decide...

00:51:09,730 --> 00:51:10,860

{b}I'll convince Tae Oh...

00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:51,300
{b}because of Joon Young.

474
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:58,490
{b}You know very well that Joon Young was just an excuse.

475
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:01,280
{b}That's why you came all the way here.

476
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:05,950
{b}It was just a one-night mistake.

477
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:10,570
{b}And I'm going to believe that.

478
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:16,740
{b}If you don't want to get humiliated, just promise me...

479
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:18,700
{b}that you'll never show up before us again.

480
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:21,240
{b}If you don't,

481
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:25,200
{b}I'll just sue you for having committed adultery.

482
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:28,510
{b}I have nothing more to fear. You think I won't be able to do it?

483
00:54:36,990 --> 00:54:39,450
{b}What is it that you want to protect?

484
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:42,300
{b}Tae Oh?

485
00:54:43,090 --> 00:54:46,760
{b}Your family? Or your pride?

486
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,740
{b}Will your anxiety subside...

487
00:54:53,010 --> 00:54:54,970
{b}if I promise not to show up?

488
00:54:55,030 --> 00:54:57,110
{b}That's none of your business.

489
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:00,970
{b}You're right. It's your right to choose.

490
00:55:03,450 --> 00:55:05,410
{b}And that's none of my business.

491
00:55:09,050 --> 00:55:11,390
{b}But before you choose, there's something you need to know.

492
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:18,890
{b}What are you doing?

493
00:55:19,490 --> 00:55:20,660
{b}I'm going to show you...

494
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:24,340
{b}Tae Oh's true nature.

495
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:36,470
{b}This used to be my favorite song.

496
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:39,490
{b}And because of that, Tae Oh liked it, too.

497
00:55:40,910 --> 00:55:44,450
{b}This isn't just our favorite song. There's a special meaning to it.

498
00:55:46,930 --> 00:55:48,550
{b}He proposed to me...

499
00:55:51,030 --> 00:55:52,800
{b}with this song playing in the background.

500
00:55:58,110 --> 00:55:59,700
{b}"Let's get married, Sun Woo."

501
00:56:00,530 --> 00:56:05,010
{b}"I promise I'll make you and our baby happy."

502
00:56:06,110 --> 00:56:08,620
{b}"I'm not doing this because you're pregnant."

503
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:13,450
{b}"It's because I love you, Sun Woo."

504
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:19,050
{b}"I want to share my life with you."

505
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:20,660
{b}"Let's live together."

506
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:29,990
{b}Did he say something similar to you?

507
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:35,930
{b}Did he tell you you're his one and only love?

508
00:56:39,870 --> 00:56:41,840
{b}Did he whisper words of love?

509
00:56:42,970 --> 00:56:44,340
{b}Don't lie to me.

510
00:56:49,050 --> 00:56:50,720
{b}You have no proof.

511
00:56:58,470 --> 00:57:02,200
{b}Follow me. I'll prove to you that I'm not lying.

512
00:57:03,430 --> 00:57:04,660
{b}Where are you taking me?

513
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:10,300
{b}To my house.

514
00:57:48,550 --> 00:57:49,970
{b}What about that?

515
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:52,990
{b}I was shocked when I first saw the resemblance.

516
00:57:54,890 --> 00:57:56,090
{b}Don't you get it?

517
00:57:57,050 --> 00:57:58,160
{b}Look carefully.

518
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:03,050
{b}I saw everything in your bedroom when I went to your place.

519
00:58:05,370 --> 00:58:07,200
{b}We had the same perfume.

520
00:58:09,090 --> 00:58:11,110
{b}The same kind of underwear.

521
00:58:12,910 --> 00:58:14,740
{b}And even wore the same type of wedding dress.

522
00:58:16,510 --> 00:58:18,740
{b}They were all the same, and it completely creeped me out.

523
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:21,820
{b}Did Tae Oh pick them out for you?

524
00:58:23,450 --> 00:58:24,550
{b}Or...

525
00:58:25,450 --> 00:58:26,950
{b}did you pick them yourself?

526
00:58:31,450 --> 00:58:34,550
{b}You went through my stuff and bought the same things.

527
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:38,090
{b}How much worse can you get?

528
00:58:38,090 --> 00:58:39,390
{b}Don't you think you're being immature?

529
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:09,090
{b}I don't have irrefutable evidence that you want.

530
00:59:14,030 --> 00:59:15,090
{b}However,

531
00:59:16,590 --> 00:59:17,740
{b}I don't lie.

532
00:59:22,970 --> 00:59:25,050
{b}I don't know whether or not Tae Oh is conscious of it,

533
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:28,280
{b}but you...

534
00:59:30,450 --> 00:59:31,950
{b}are a lot like me.

535
00:59:34,050 --> 00:59:35,260
{b}What do you think?

536
00:59:47,870 --> 00:59:49,090
{b}Many people dress like that.

537
00:59:49,370 --> 00:59:50,910
{b}Don't try to force it.

538
00:59:50,910 --> 00:59:52,370
{b}He's meticulous and detail-oriented, right?

539
00:59:53,110 --> 00:59:55,070
{b}Everything must go according to plan.

540
00:59:56,370 --> 00:59:57,680
{b}You probably thought...

541
00:59:58,110 --> 01:00:00,680
{b}he was free-spirited, and that drew you to him.

542
01:00:01,820 --> 01:00:04,640
{b}He probably fell for you,

543
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:07,280
{b}who looked up to him and provided for him.

544
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:11,720
{b}You and I are the type that he's instinctively drawn to.

545
01:00:18,390 --> 01:00:22,070
{b}Are you trying to insist that he's still into you?

546
01:00:24,510 --> 01:00:27,430
{b}Why am I listening to your delusions?

547
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:30,800
{b}What if a woman like that appears again?

548
01:00:33,950 --> 01:00:37,340
{b}You're right. It's a common look.

549
01:00:39,910 --> 01:00:42,760
{b}There are plenty of women like us.

550
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:48,300
{b}Sadly, Tae Oh is a free spirit.

551
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:53,760
{b}He is drawn to the woman who takes good care of him,

552
01:00:54,570 --> 01:00:57,030
{b}but once he feels like he is being stifled,

553
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:59,610
{b}he'll look for a place to breathe.

554
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:02,240
{b}Just as he fell for you...

555
01:01:03,430 --> 01:01:04,700
{b}while he was with me.

556
01:01:09,550 --> 01:01:10,840
{b}I'm sure by the time...

557

{b}Jenny is Joon Young's age.

558
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:20,720
{b}Can you guarantee that won't happen?

559
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:14,950
{b}That's how useless it is.

560
01:02:16,620 --> 01:02:19,510
{b}That's all that supposedly great love amounts to.

561
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:25,590
{b}What is marriage?

562
01:02:28,430 --> 01:02:29,990
{b}You're blinded briefly...

563
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:34,030
{b}by the misconception that it's fate and get married.

564
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:36,890
{b}Is it worth giving your all as collateral...

565
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:42,110
{b}just because you lived together for a few years?

566
01:02:47,450 --> 01:02:49,280
{b}Knowing you'll be miserable.

567
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:55,990
{b}I still don't get it.

568
01:03:00,550 --> 01:03:01,950
{b}One thing is for sure.

569
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:07,470
{b}You can't raise a child with a man you know will hurt you.

01:09:29,820 --> 01:09:31,250
{b}Did something happen?

630
01:09:33,490 --> 01:09:36,050
{b}I think your father's really angry at me.

631
01:09:38,660 --> 01:09:39,660
{b}No.

632
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:42,030
{b}Let's talk in person at home.

633
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,590
{b}Call me back when you get this.

634
01:10:07,820 --> 01:10:08,960
{b}What are you doing?

635
01:10:11,250 --> 01:10:12,380
{b}I said, what are you doing?

636
01:10:13,580 --> 01:10:15,250
{b}We settled all the documents.

637
01:10:20,930 --> 01:10:22,200
{b}Take this and get lost.

638
01:10:22,590 --> 01:10:24,500
{b}I don't want to talk to you anymore.

639
01:10:25,630 --> 01:10:27,430
{b}Bring this car to the location.

640
01:10:27,710 --> 01:10:28,780
{b}Yes, sir.

641
01:10:29,780 --> 01:10:30,970
{b}Why the car...

642
01:10:31,910 --> 01:10:34,170
{b}"Documents"? What documents?

643
01:10:34,170 --> 01:10:35,280
{b}Divorce documents!

644
01:10:35,950 --> 01:10:37,340
{b}Giving up your rights to Jenny's custody.

645
01:10:38,580 --> 01:10:40,380
{b}Also, the title I gave you at the company.

646
01:10:41,050 --> 01:10:43,960
{b}It's over. Don't you get it?

647
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:47,490
{b}Father, why are you suddenly acting like this?

648
01:10:47,790 --> 01:10:49,290
{b}There must be a misunderstanding.

649
01:10:49,290 --> 01:10:50,530
{b}I'm not your father!

650
01:10:50,530 --> 01:10:51,790
{b}- Father.
- Jerk.

651
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:57,430
{b}The only thing I wanted from you...

652
01:10:58,300 --> 01:10:59,540
{b}was to make...

653
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:02,410
{b}my daughter happy.

654
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:05,110
{b}Had you done your job properly,

655
01:11:06,210 --> 01:11:09,140
{b}I would have cherished you...

656
01:11:09,510 --> 01:11:12,180
{b}like a real son and as a friend.

657
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:15,680
{b}When a father raises their daughter preciously,

658
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:18,420
{b}that's what they dream of.

659
01:11:20,420 --> 01:11:21,790
{b}But unfortunately,

660
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:25,790
{b}this is as far as it'll go. It's just as I had predicted.

661
01:11:29,070 --> 01:11:30,260
{b}Let's end things here.

662
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:32,610
{b}Don't you ever...

663
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:34,970
{b}show up in front of us again.

664
01:11:37,210 --> 01:11:38,610
{b}I'll speak to Da Kyung.

665
01:11:38,610 --> 01:11:40,380
{b}Where is she right now? Where's Da Kyung?

666
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:53,380
{b}Jenny.

667
01:12:03,570 --> 01:12:04,610
{b}Honey.

668
01:12:05,260 --> 01:12:06,330
{b}Da Kyung.

669
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,580
{b}Don't bother with him and get in the car.

670
01:12:11,170 --> 01:12:12,610
{b}I'll take care of it.

671
01:12:13,610 --> 01:12:15,250
{b}You should wait in the car.

672
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:19,950
{b}I thought you said you'd forgive me.

673
01:12:21,050 --> 01:12:22,320
{b}We decided to work on it together.

674
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:24,120
{b}Why would you suddenly do this?

675
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:26,460
{b}That's when you made just one mistake.

676
01:12:28,390 --> 01:12:30,860
{b}But that wasn't the case.

677
01:12:32,390 --> 01:12:35,130
{b}I won't be fooled again. It's over.

678
01:12:38,210 --> 01:12:39,760
{b}There's no need to listen to everything your father says.

679
01:12:40,370 --> 01:12:42,130
{b}Let's take care of our problem on our own.

680
01:12:42,130 --> 01:12:43,740
{b}Dad knew everything!

681
01:12:45,210 --> 01:12:47,920
{b}He was preparing for everything because he was worried about me.

682
01:12:49,510 --> 01:12:52,510
{b}I feel sorry for Jenny who has you as her dad,

683
01:12:53,950 --> 01:12:55,380
{b}but it's a hundred times better not to have you around.

684
01:12:56,620 --> 01:12:57,960
{b}Don't you ever think about seeing her again.

685
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:02,660
{b}You're all I have.

686
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:09,540
{b}I love you, Da Kyung. Please.

687
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:12,300
{b}The song you used to propose to me...

688
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:17,880
{b}was used on that woman too.

689
01:13:19,670 --> 01:13:22,120
{b}The perfume you bought for me was the one she used too,

690
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:23,820
{b}as well as my underwear, wedding dress, and everything else.

691
01:13:28,290 --> 01:13:29,620
{b}Who am I to you?

692
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:35,550
{b}What was I to you?

693
01:13:36,750 --> 01:13:38,290
{b}What are you talking about?

694
01:13:38,460 --> 01:13:40,760
{b}The delusional one wasn't that woman.

695
01:13:44,070 --> 01:13:45,170
{b}It was me.

696
01:13:47,740 --> 01:13:49,800
{b}I found out everything.

697
01:13:50,830 --> 01:13:52,210
{b}To you,

698
01:13:54,970 --> 01:13:57,420
{b}I was just a substitute for Ji Sun Woo.

699
01:14:02,250 --> 01:14:03,580
{b}Go to that woman.

700
01:14:17,170 --> 01:14:19,070
{b}Da Kyung. Wait.

701
01:14:19,430 --> 01:14:21,430
{b}Jenny! Jenny, wait!

702
01:14:22,830 --> 01:14:25,000
{b}Da Kyung, let me talk to Jenny for a minute.

703
01:14:25,170 --> 01:14:27,340
{b}Da Kyung! Let me talk to Jenny!

704
01:16:20,010 --> 01:16:21,080
{b}Get out!

705
01:16:22,420 --> 01:16:23,580
{b}I said, get out!

{b}It's all your fault.

707
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:32,030
{b}I lost everything because of you!

708
01:16:32,490 --> 01:16:35,860
{b}Did you plan everything to ruin me?

709
01:16:39,370 --> 01:16:42,770
{b}What did you say to Da Kyung?

710
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:08,530
{b}The house, money,

711
01:17:10,930 --> 01:17:12,130

712

{b}Did you settle everything with him?

{b}You're a monster.

724
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:37,600
{b}I never should've met you.

725
01:20:38,710 --> 01:20:40,570
{b}You ruined my life.

726

{b}You should've just killed me.

{b}That would've been better for both of us.

{b}Will you please get to your senses?

729
01:20:51,990 --> 01:20:53,820
{b}Think of all the things you've done...

{b}before trying to blame others.

{b}Do you still not get it?

733

{b}Joon Young knows everything.

734
01:21:05,270 --> 01:21:06,330
{b}Knows what?

735
01:21:06,870 --> 01:21:08,400
{b}He knows why I hit you.

01:21:09,100 --> 01:21:10,740
{b}Joon Young knows everything.

737
01:21:13,610 --> 01:21:16,710
{b}Joon Young hates you. No, he loathes you.

738
01:21:18,280 --> 01:21:20,680
{b}He knows how monstrous you are.

739
01:21:21,750 --> 01:21:24,150
{b}He can never be happy with you.

740
01:21:31,890 --> 01:21:33,930
{b}You might be able to abandon me, but not Joon Young!

741
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:37,100
{b}I'm going to meet him...

742
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:40,130
{b}and tell him exactly what you did to me today.

743
01:21:41,330 --> 01:21:44,000
{b}I'll tell him how you completely destroyed my life.

744
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,510
{b}He deserves to know that, doesn't he?

745
01:23:51,330 --> 01:23:54,370
{b}My goodness, did you receive a private lesson?

- You played so nicely today.

{b}It's nice to be outside.

749

{b}I heard the land where the film set was going to be built...

750
01:24:06,250 --> 01:24:07,650
{b}is going to be sold at a very low price.

751
01:24:08,250 --> 01:24:11,520
{b}I guess Chairman Yeo and his family aren't planning to come back.

{b}My husband also thinks the same way.

753
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:20,290
{b}But it looks like Dr. Ji is back.

754
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:23,230
{b}Mr. Lee was forced to get a divorce and got kicked out.

755
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:25,830
{b}Chairman Yeo and his family left Gosan.

756
01:24:26,070 --> 01:24:28,330
{b}And now, Ji Sun Woo comes back like she had it all planned.

757
01:24:28,740 --> 01:24:29,900
{b}Doesn't it seem like...

758
01:24:30,940 --> 01:24:33,370
{b}something happened between them?

759
01:24:33,370 --> 01:24:37,340
{b}There are rumors saying Dr. Ji was the one who got them divorced.

760
01:24:38,110 --> 01:24:40,450
{b}Every married couple has a story we don't know about.

{b}Don't get yourselves in trouble...

{b}for talking about other people's families. Be careful.

763

{b}By the way, what's the director's plan?

764
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:52,260
{b}The chairperson seems pretty stern about it.

765
01:24:53,060 --> 01:24:55,530
{b}And my husband also thinks it's hard to find someone like her.

766

01:26:14,740 --> 01:26:16,640
{b}and thinks you should hurry up and come back to work.

785
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:21,580
{b}He's very nervous that you might end up...

786
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:23,220
{b}working at another hospital.

787
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:26,350
{b}Do you think it's a good idea?

788
01:26:26,750 --> 01:26:28,150
{b}I feel too ashamed to come back here.

789
01:26:28,150 --> 01:26:30,120
{b}Don't worry and start working here again.

790
01:26:31,590 --> 01:26:33,590
{b}We left your office empty all along.

791
01:26:34,190 --> 01:26:36,700
{b}Stop making the director feel so anxious.

792
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:39,870
{b}Thank you.

793
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:47,670
{b}By the way, about Tae Oh...

794
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:51,740
{b}I don't think he left for good.

795
01:26:52,150 --> 01:26:53,550
{b}Remember Woo Ho Sang?

796
01:26:53,950 --> 01:26:55,450
{b}My high school friend you met last time.

797
01:26:56,450 --> 01:26:58,350
{b}He told me he saw Tae Oh pretty recently.

798
01:27:00,490 --> 01:27:02,520
{b}- Where?
- In Gosan.

799
01:27:03,490 --> 01:27:05,390
{b}He looked all haggard...

800
01:27:05,730 --> 01:27:08,260
{b}and was fighting a street bar owner for not having paid properly.

801
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:13,030
{b}My friend felt bad for him, so he offered to pay instead.

802
01:27:13,830 --> 01:27:15,970
{b}But once he looked back, he was already gone.

803
01:27:18,740 --> 01:27:19,910
{b}When was that?

804
01:27:21,810 --> 01:27:24,140
{b}About a week ago.

805
01:27:27,110 --> 01:27:30,020
{b}Why don't you look for him?

806
01:27:31,150 --> 01:27:34,590
{b}I'm worried he might get himself in trouble.

807
01:27:36,660 --> 01:27:37,760
{b}Why should I?

808
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:39,460
{b}He's probably thinking clearer now.

809
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:46,430
{b}When are you coming home?

810
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:52,470
{b}Okay.

811
01:28:54,230 --> 01:28:57,200
{b}Joon Young. I'm home.

812
01:29:41,850 --> 01:29:42,880
{b}Joon Young?

813
01:29:44,050 --> 01:29:45,080
{b}Joon Young.

814
01:29:56,760 --> 01:29:58,400
{\c&H80FFFF&\b1}(Son){\c}

815
01:30:44,980 --> 01:30:47,550
{b}I'm taking Joon Young.

816

{\c&HC0C0C0&\b0}(A World of Married Couple){\b\c}

817
01:31:30,190 --> 01:31:32,730
{b}I'm glad Joon Young hung in there so well.

818
01:31:33,130 --> 01:31:35,230
{b}I think it's really over now.

819
01:31:35,460 --> 01:31:36,830
{b}Let's do it before it's too late.

820
01:31:37,260 --> 01:31:39,570
{b}It's so easy. Why did we push it off?

821
01:31:39,770 --> 01:31:41,130
{b}Are you still mad...

822
01:31:41,130 --> 01:31:42,840
{b}because I said no once?

823
01:31:43,070 --> 01:31:44,500
{b}You don't have to say anything.

824
01:31:44,500 --> 01:31:47,110
{b}Let's just stay like this for a little while.

825
01:31:47,610 --> 01:31:50,480
{b}Have you heard from Tae Oh?

826
01:31:50,780 --> 01:31:53,210
{b}I'm sure he won't show up again.

827
01:31:53,380 --> 01:31:55,950
{b}You were always the only one for me.

828
01:31:56,550 --> 01:31:57,820
{b}Let's start over.

829
01:31:58,220 --> 01:31:59,890
{b}What use is that now?

830
01:32:00,190 --> 01:32:01,920
{b}You ruined everything, Dad.

831
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:03,220
{b}The truth is,

832
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:06,960
{b}Je Hyuk said he thought he saw Tae Oh recently.

833
01:32:07,160 --> 01:32:08,190
{b}Sun Woo.

834
01:32:09,160 --> 01:32:10,560
{b}Will you come see me?
