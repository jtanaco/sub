00:13:57,603 --> 00:13:58,812
<b>the press keeps this a secret.</b>

159
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:01,315
<b>We won't be able to stop the press.</b>

160
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,067
<b>It's better to come up with a solution.</b>

161
00:14:08,947 --> 00:14:10,073
<b>Does that mean</b>

162
00:14:11,033 --> 00:14:12,367
<b>Hye-won is my only option?</b>

163
00:14:13,368 --> 00:14:15,412
<b>You need to be level-headed, sir.</b>

164
00:14:16,038 --> 00:14:17,873
<b>You know how ambitious she is.</b>

165
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:20,209
<b>She won't do things your way.</b>

166
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:25,047
<b>She was a great competitor for Chan-ho.</b>

167
00:14:25,714 --> 00:14:27,841
<b>But she's not good enough to lead Issume.</b>

168
00:14:30,177 --> 00:14:32,429
<b>This may upset you,
but I need to tell you the truth.</b>

169
00:14:33,013 --> 00:14:35,098
<b>You need to listen to me right now.</b>

170
00:14:35,182 --> 00:14:37,017
<b>Think of the company.</b>

171
00:14:39,603 --> 00:14:42,231
<b>Jun-ho is still too young.</b>

172
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:44,149
<b>That's what I'm here for.</b>

173
00:14:44,858 --> 00:14:45,984
<b>Use me, sir.</b>

174
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:50,239
<b>I'll make sure he becomes good enough
for the position.</b>

175
00:15:12,302 --> 00:15:16,306
<b>Chan-ho isn't evil at heart.</b>

176
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,516
<b>Right.</b>

177
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:20,519
<b>I guess we can do what you suggested

178
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:24,022
<b>-But take good care of Chan-ho for me.
-Okay, sir.</b>

179
00:15:49,172 --> 00:15:50,883
<b>Can we talk for a moment?</b>

180
00:15:51,133 --> 00:15:53,719
<b>My gosh, this is like
a National Assembly hearing.</b>

181
00:15:53,802 --> 00:15:55,721
<b>"I don't remember. I don't know."</b>

182
00:15:56,346 --> 00:15:58,765
<b>Lucky we were able to arrest him

183

<b>You're dealing with Issume.
He's the CEO of Issume.</b>

184

<b>You need to think about the future.</b>

185
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,858
<b>Well, I'm sure you already know this.</b>

186
00:16:09,067 --> 00:16:11,528
<b>But please be careful not to leak this
to the press.</b>

187
00:16:12,654 --> 00:16:16,033
<b>The superintendent already told us</b>

189

<b>You guys are so close.</b>

194
00:16:40,307 --> 00:16:43,185
<b>I called for a team meeting.

00:16:57,407 --> 00:16:59,910
<b>-The Ha Jun-ho?

<b><i>Why did you call me at this hour?</i></b>

200

<b>You knew, didn't you?</b>

201
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:14,758
<b>About Jeong-hwa and Jun-ho.</b>

202
00:17:16,593 --> 00:17:17,970
<b>What?</b>

203
00:17:25,435 --> 00:17:27,270
<b>I don't have any proof yet.</b>

204

<b>-No way.
-You're the one</b>

206

207

<b>So I want you to find out.</b>

208
00:17:44,913 --> 00:17:46,039
<b>Do you</b>

209
00:17:46,873 --> 00:17:47,833

210
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:51,420
<b>She looks at him differently.</b>

211
00:17:53,588 --> 00:17:55,674
<b>She's different when she's around him.</b>

212
00:17:57,426 --> 00:17:58,969
<b>So I want you to find out.</b>

213
00:18:05,392 --> 00:18:07,978
<b>You know what you're saying, right?</b>

214
00:18:08,061 --> 00:18:10,397
<b>You just stated his motive
for murdering Seo Jeong-hwa.</b>

215
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,525
<b>The cops should never find out.</b>

216
00:18:15,569 --> 00:18:19,239
<b>They took Seo Jeong-hwa's cell phone
from the scene as evidence.</b>

217
00:18:19,781 --> 00:18:21,158
<b>Once they look at the call logs,</b>

218
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:23,660
<b>they'll find out about Ha Jun-ho.</b>

219
00:18:23,744 --> 00:18:25,829
<b>They were extremely secretive
about their relationship.</b>

220
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:31,543
<b>She probably had another cell phone.</b>

221
00:18:32,836 --> 00:18:35,088
<b>It'll only be a matter of time
before they find out.</b>

222
00:18:36,256 --> 00:18:37,299
<b>We will</b>

223
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:39,468
<b>just have to check.</b>

224
00:18:40,802 --> 00:18:43,346
<b>Ha Chan-ho was always obsessed

225
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:44,806
<b>You of all people should know that.</b>

226
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,352
<b>We should be careful.</b>

227
00:18:56,151 --> 00:18:57,611
<b>Seo Jeong-hwa is dead.</b>

228
00:19:01,239 --> 00:19:02,866
<b>She's dead, okay?</b>

229
00:19:04,868 --> 00:19:06,661

<b>Let's not forget that.</b>

233

<b>SEO JEONG-HWA, VICTIM, DEAD</b>

234

<b>HA CHAN-HO, ARRESTED AT THE SCENE</b>

235
00:19:36,817 --> 00:19:38,527
<b>Gosh, what a complete mess.</b>

236
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:40,862
<b>I'm not even surprised by this.</b>

237
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:42,447
<b>What do you mean?</b>

238
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:45,992
<b>This isn't the first time
Ha Chan-ho got obsessed with Seo Jeong-hwa</b>

239
00:19:46,535 --> 00:19:47,869
<b>and caused trouble.</b>

240
00:19:49,037 --> 00:19:51,998
<b>How did you get photos
of the crime scene so quickly?</b>

241
00:19:52,082 --> 00:19:53,917
<b>I took them myself.</b>

242
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,377
<b>What?</b>

243
00:19:55,877 --> 00:19:58,171
<b>It's very dogmatic and illegal.</b>

244
00:19:58,755 --> 00:20:00,257
<b>But let's keep going.</b>

245
00:20:00,674 --> 00:20:04,553
<b>We all know that it's better for us
to have those photos anyway.</b>

246
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,973
<b>Victim, Seo Jeong-hwa.</b>

247
00:20:08,515 --> 00:20:09,766
<b>She was Ha Chan-ho's mistress.</b>

248
00:20:10,267 --> 00:20:12,394
<b>And they've been
living together for months.</b>

249
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:15,021
<b>The accident occurred
at the White Hotel suite.</b>

250
00:20:15,105 --> 00:20:19,151
<b>As you can see, Seo Jeong-hwa
hit her head on the glass table.</b>

251
00:20:19,234 --> 00:20:20,235
<b>We'll have to wait</b>

252
00:20:20,318 --> 00:20:23,155
<b>for the autopsy and forensics
to know the accurate cause of death.</b>

253
00:20:23,238 --> 00:20:26,741
<b>But for now, it looks she died
due to a severe skull fracture.</b>

254
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:28,910
<b>Did you notice any other scars or bruises?</b>

255
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,830
<b>We can only refer to the photos
to find out.</b>

256
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:34,457
<b>She's covered in blood,
so I can't even tell.</b>

257
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:37,836
<b>Ha Chan-ho got arrested
at the crime scene.</b>

258
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,005
<b>He was completely drunk.</b>

259
00:20:40,088 --> 00:20:43,175
<b>So he keeps saying
he can't remember anything.</b>

260
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:44,718
<b>What about the bloodstains?</b>

261
00:20:44,801 --> 00:20:46,970
<b>She was apparently like that
when he woke up,</b>

262
00:20:47,053 --> 00:20:50,223
<b>so he was shocked
and tried to see if she was okay.</b>

263
00:20:50,807 --> 00:20:51,808
<b>That's how he got them.</b>

264
00:20:52,434 --> 00:20:54,060
<b>How drunk do you need to be</b>

265
00:20:54,144 --> 00:20:57,105
<b>to not be able to notice anything
even when the glass table got shattered?</b>

266
00:20:58,899 --> 00:21:01,693
<b>Let's say we believe
that Ha Chan-ho is innocent.</b>

267
00:21:01,776 --> 00:21:03,403
<b>But how are we going to prove that?</b>

268
00:21:03,904 --> 00:21:07,157
<b>We need to prove that she either collapsed
on her own or was killed by someone else.</b>

269
00:21:08,408 --> 00:21:09,868
<b>What about the hotel CCTVs?</b>

270
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:12,954
<b>There are no CCTVs
at the White Hotel suite</b>

271
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:16,082
<b>because they care about
protecting their VIPs' privacy.</b>

272
00:21:17,292 --> 00:21:20,545
<b>It's better for Ha Chan-ho
to say it happened by accident</b>

273
00:21:21,087 --> 00:21:22,923
<b>because he was too drunk.</b>

274
00:21:23,006 --> 00:21:26,509
<b>If it was accidental, he'll only
get locked up for six months to a year.</b>

275
00:21:27,093 --> 00:21:29,012
<b>He has no motive to murder her,</b>

276
00:21:29,095 --> 00:21:31,473
<b>so I guess we could say he got drunk
and made a mistake.</b>

277
00:21:32,307 --> 00:21:35,685
<b>He's Ha Chan-ho, so he could
just get sentenced to probation.</b>

278
00:21:36,478 --> 00:21:37,729
<b>That's not a bad idea.</b>

279
00:21:38,313 --> 00:21:42,567
<b>We'll consider Mr. Yoon's idea
if we fail to prove that he's innocent.</b>

280
00:21:43,276 --> 00:21:46,404
<b>It's extremely crucial
that we keep this confidential.</b>

281
00:21:47,322 --> 00:21:49,908
<b>Once this leaks,
rumors will start spreading.</b>

282
00:21:49,991 --> 00:21:51,952
<b>Later on, the truth won't even matter.</b>

283
00:21:52,535 --> 00:21:54,913
<b>Yes, it's the best kind of topic

-Yes, it's a mess.</b>

<b>Aren't you in charge of Issume?</b>

309
00:23:24,002 --> 00:23:27,756
<b>This time, Mr. Song asked Mr. Yoon
to take care of the issue.</b>

310
00:23:29,299 --> 00:23:31,343
<b>I bet he's very upset right now.</b>

311
00:23:32,302 --> 00:23:34,763
<b>He cared so much about Ha Chan-ho.</b>

312
00:23:35,305 --> 00:23:37,015
<b>Now is the best time to attack.</b>

<b>If Ha Chan-ho loses power,
so will Mr. Song.</b>

314
00:23:40,727 --> 00:23:42,979
<b>We need to use this opportunity

315

<b>Do you have a plan?</b>

316
00:23:49,402 --> 00:23:51,946
<b>How about using Ha Hye-won?</b>

317
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:56,659
<b>Should I call her right away?</b>

318
00:23:56,743 --> 00:23:58,745
<b>No, not yet.</b>

319
00:23:58,828 --> 00:24:01,289
<b>Let's see how Mr. Song reacts to this.</b>

320
00:24:01,498 --> 00:24:04,334
<b>If we do anything rash,
it might backfire on us.</b>

<b>I disagree.</b>

<b>I don't care what you think.

<b>Don't cause a mess of things and stay put.</b>

324
00:24:19,808 --> 00:24:21,393
<b>Should we get started?</b>

325
00:24:21,476 --> 00:24:23,812
<b>My gosh, we really don't click.</b>

326
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:26,940
<b>-Pardon?
-Just stay put</b>

327
00:24:27,023 --> 00:24:28,650
<b>if you don't want things to backfire!</b>

328
00:24:32,904 --> 00:24:34,364

<b>How did you find her so quickly?</b>

335
00:24:56,719 --> 00:24:57,846
<b>I had a GPS device installed</b>

336

<b>on her cell phone.</b>

337
00:25:01,683 --> 00:25:03,226
<b>I bought her that cell phone.</b>

338
00:25:06,646 --> 00:25:07,981
<b>What happened after you met her?</b>

339
00:25:11,693 --> 00:25:13,319
<b>She told me</b>

340
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:16,281
<b>that she can no longer live with me.</b>

341
00:25:17,031 --> 00:25:18,908
<b>I fought with her and apologized.</b>

00:25:18,992 --> 00:25:21,870
<b>I even begged her.

<b>I found her like that upon waking up,

<b>About half a bottle of hard liquor.

<b>I wasn't that drunk.</b>

352

<b>The police did a drug test, right?</b>

<b>No, I'm trying to approach this

<b>So what, then? Do you believe Ha Chan-ho?</b>

409
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:04,485

<b>-Do you know what this means?
-Ha Chan-ho's motive.</b>

607
00:43:02,309 --> 00:43:04,936
<b>Up until now,
we could've argued manslaughter</b>

608
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:07,230
<b>because there wasn't
any other clear motive,</b>

609
00:43:07,314 --> 00:43:08,607
<b>but this changes everything!</b>

610
00:43:10,317 --> 00:43:11,818
<b>Who will see this as accidental?</b>

611
00:43:11,902 --> 00:43:13,737
<b>This points to murder!</b>

612
00:43:15,614 --> 00:43:17,282
<b>Why would Ha Jun-ho...</b>

613
00:43:18,492 --> 00:43:20,702
<b>I mean, this anonymous man
other than Ha Jun-ho.</b>

614
00:43:21,203 --> 00:43:23,121
<b>Why would an anonymous man
reveal this now?</b>

615
00:43:25,707 --> 00:43:29,753
<b>It's probably someone
who wants Ha Chan-ho behind bars.</b>

616
00:43:30,962 --> 00:43:32,172
<b>And who would that be?</b>

617
00:43:33,173 --> 00:43:34,049
<b>That's a long list.</b>

618

<b>HA JUN-HO, ISSUME</b>

625
00:44:12,879 --> 00:44:14,005
<b>You...</b>

00:44:15,173 --> 00:44:16,049
<b>must.</b>

<b>You don't really have a choice.</b>

629

<b>You know a man who can help? Who is he?</b>

630

<b>I'm Kevin Jung, the branch manager

<b>We need foreign investors

633
00:44:57,799 --> 00:45:02,387
<b>In that sense,
AP EON will be most influential.</b>

634
00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:06,975
<b>Issume is floundering
due to Ha Chan-ho's antics,</b>

635

636
00:45:11,062 --> 00:45:13,982
<b>Mr. Jung here will support

637
00:45:16,735 --> 00:45:17,819
<b>I thank you in advance.</b>

638
00:45:33,627 --> 00:45:35,170
<b>I can't believe you called me.</b>

639
00:45:36,046 --> 00:45:37,505
<b>I was surprised at first.</b>

640
00:45:37,923 --> 00:45:40,091
<b>Mr. Song suggested it. Take care, then.</b>

641

<b>How's Ms. Jung doing?</b>

642
00:45:44,554 --> 00:45:45,972
<b>I haven't seen her in a while.</b>

643
00:45:46,765 --> 00:45:48,683
<b>She's busy with Ha Chan-ho's case, right?</b>

644
00:45:54,356 --> 00:45:55,857
<b>Rather than asking me,</b>

645
00:45:56,191 --> 00:45:58,401
<b>ask her directly if you're that curious.</b>

646
00:46:01,571 --> 00:46:02,697
<b>I wonder why</b>

647
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:04,950
<b>I'm so bothered by you.</b>

648
00:46:08,995 --> 00:46:10,580
<b>Because I like her.</b>

649
00:46:12,165 --> 00:46:13,875
<b>She's the woman I like.</b>

650
00:46:16,544 --> 00:46:18,255
<b>Is that what you wanted to hear?</b>

651
00:46:33,937 --> 00:46:37,023
<b>Ha Chan-ho didn't do any drugs.
He was wasted though.</b>

652

<b>-But zolpidem was found in his system.
-Zolpidem?</b>

<b>A MEDICATION USED TO TREAT INSOMNIA</b>

654

<b>-That's for insomnia.
-Right.</b>

<b>One of the detectives

<b>But Eun-yeong,</b>

<b>anyone can tell that Ha Chan-ho did it.</b>

659
00:46:56,167 --> 00:46:58,962
<b>-Ju-ho--
-Why are you going this far for him?</b>

660
00:46:59,045 --> 00:47:00,297
<b>Because you're a lawyer?</b>

661
00:47:01,006 --> 00:47:03,258
<b>-Forget about that--
-She died.</b>

662
00:47:04,467 --> 00:47:06,761
<b>Seo Jeong-hwa died.</b>

663
00:47:11,808 --> 00:47:13,476
<b>This may be my fault.</b>

664
00:47:13,810 --> 00:47:15,228
<b><i>Then stay with Ha Chan-ho.</i></b>

665

<b>It's the only way</b>

<b>This case</b>

668

<b>started with me.</b>

669

<b>Every evidence points to Ha Chan-ho.</b>

670

<b>It's just too easy.</b>

<b>"To the people of Korea"?</b>

<b>for attempted murder.</b>

<b>He's threatening to release it

<b>SHE CHANGED HER NAME TO JUNG GEUM-JA</b>

680

<b>He has no evidence against you.</b>

<b>His only evidence</b>

682
00:48:12,243 --> 00:48:13,745
<b>is his own memory.</b>

698
00:49:10,135 --> 00:49:12,303
<b>The responsibility is too grave</b>

<b>This is only happening

759
00:55:38,397 --> 00:55:40,399
<b>I told you to set personal feelings aside.</b>

760
00:55:41,025 --> 00:55:42,693
<b>You never believed Ha Chan-ho, did you?</b>

761
00:55:42,777 --> 00:55:45,655
<b>You're the one who's being clouded

<b>Seo Jeong-hwa returned to Ha Chan-ho

<b>Aren't I right?</b>

764
00:55:49,992 --> 00:55:52,286
<b>That guilt is making you hope
that Ha Chan-ho didn't do it.</b>

765
00:55:52,370 --> 00:55:54,455
<b>You're obsessed over a tiny possibility.</b>

766
00:55:57,875 --> 00:56:01,128
<b>Don't you think that's the reason
why you can't see things clearly?</b>

767
00:56:01,212 --> 00:56:03,297
<b>I'm honestly worried about you.</b>

<b>It's because I like you.</b>

771
00:56:10,972 --> 00:56:12,473
<b>Because I have feelings for you.</b>

772
00:56:30,950 --> 00:56:32,368
<b>Did you meet with Ju-ho?</b>

773
00:56:33,494 --> 00:56:34,787
<b>Is that why?</b>

774
00:56:36,497 --> 00:56:38,124
<b>You pity my old self?</b>

775
00:56:38,499 --> 00:56:40,751
<b>That's pity, not affection.</b>

776
00:56:41,210 --> 00:56:42,378
<b>And I don't need any of that.</b>

777
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:48,676

<b>You'll push me away again.</b>

788

<b>You'll run away from me</b>

789

792
