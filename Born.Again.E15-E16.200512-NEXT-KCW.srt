(Jang Hye Mi. Walk my dog, Manson.)

7
00:01:23,891 --> 00:01:24,775
Sit.

8
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,368
Good boy.

9
00:02:06,852 --> 00:02:08,393
Go inside.

10
00:02:51,555 --> 00:02:53,538
Manson is a ferocious dog.

11
00:02:53,563 --> 00:02:55,603
How did you make it behave so well?

12
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:59,944
Dogs have good intuition
so they know whom to fight.

13
00:03:00,954 --> 00:03:02,728
They feel the energy wave...

14
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,949
and use their sense of smell.

15
00:03:05,711 --> 00:03:07,173
After that, a ferocious dog will...

16
00:03:08,173 --> 00:03:10,955
- choose its owner.
- You like this tea, don't you?

("Wuthering Heights"
by Emily BrontĂ«)

18
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:19,564
Revenge.

19
00:03:20,259 --> 00:03:23,768
Upon his return,
Heathcliff destroyed everything...

20
00:03:24,446 --> 00:03:26,538
and led everyone to destruction.

21
00:03:29,446 --> 00:03:32,176
Destroying is a way
of possessing love.

22
00:03:34,501 --> 00:03:37,615
Watching the woman he loves die
because of himself...

23
00:03:38,673 --> 00:03:40,919
what would've Heathcliff felt like?

24
00:03:42,045 --> 00:03:43,306
I don't know.

25
00:03:44,187 --> 00:03:45,695
Wouldn't he have cried?

26
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:50,895
What would it feel like to kill
someone you love?

27
00:03:53,376 --> 00:03:56,552
Well, I wouldn't know that.

28
00:03:58,079 --> 00:03:59,525
Do you think it would be sad?

29
00:04:04,342 --> 00:04:06,844
What do you think you'd feel
if it were you?

30
00:04:06,953 --> 00:04:08,376
If it were for me,

31
00:04:10,564 --> 00:04:13,275
I wouldn't kill someone by being
caught in someone's trap.

32
00:04:15,132 --> 00:04:16,821
I could kill the one...

33
00:04:18,102 --> 00:04:19,555
who trapped me.

34
00:04:23,511 --> 00:04:26,598
Do you think the one who is
trapped...

35
00:04:27,259 --> 00:04:30,040
can realize that he is trapped?

36
00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:33,338
He could set a trap too...

37
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:37,446
and make it more painful.

38
00:04:37,492 --> 00:04:40,979
What if the game does not come
to where the trap is?

39
00:04:44,023 --> 00:04:45,493
He could lure it.

40
00:04:46,267 --> 00:04:49,821
He could arouse the instinct
of the game madly.

41
00:04:55,994 --> 00:04:57,259
I wonder what choice...

42
00:04:58,016 --> 00:05:00,298
the game would make.

43
00:05:01,431 --> 00:05:02,821
Would it be driven like a beast...

44
00:05:02,867 --> 00:05:05,993
to where the hunter wants it?

45
00:05:06,371 --> 00:05:08,469
Or would it be able...

46
00:05:09,126 --> 00:05:11,267
to deny its instinct like
a human being?

47
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:17,985
I guess you're interested
in things of this nature.

48
00:05:20,008 --> 00:05:22,008
I like writing about those games.

49
00:05:22,805 --> 00:05:26,446
Humans are the most human
when they are brutal.

50
00:05:51,475 --> 00:05:53,718
Help me!

51
00:06:01,292 --> 00:06:03,493
Before the case took place,

52
00:06:03,493 --> 00:06:05,844
a sign that says "off-limits" was
definitely here.

53
00:06:06,134 --> 00:06:10,001
But on the day Chun Jong Woo fell
in the water, the sign wasn't there.

54
00:06:10,398 --> 00:06:12,503
The distance from the villa
for the party...

55
00:06:12,503 --> 00:06:15,239
to the lake is 300 m away.

56
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:18,476
The lake is connected
to the mountains.

57
00:06:18,476 --> 00:06:19,431
What about the CCTV?

58
00:06:19,456 --> 00:06:23,381
There are no cameras near
the lake and the villa.

59
00:06:23,436 --> 00:06:25,383
They are set up...

60
00:06:25,383 --> 00:06:28,052
at a barley rice restaurant along
the walkway,

61
00:06:28,052 --> 00:06:30,655
at another restaurant that resembles
a mountain cabin,

62
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:33,424
and at a convenience store.

63
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:36,127
But the incident took place here,

64
00:06:36,127 --> 00:06:38,296
so why would you want to know
about the CCTV and the walkway?

65
00:06:38,296 --> 00:06:41,432
The culprit would've planned it out.
They always do.

66
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,336
He would've thought about a week,
three days, and the day before it.

67
00:06:45,336 --> 00:06:47,004
Even the few hours before
on the day of the incident.

68
00:06:47,454 --> 00:06:49,941
He would've visited the site
beforehand and plotted a scenario.

69
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:52,321
Check the CCTV in the walkway,

70
00:06:52,323 --> 00:06:53,743
and hand everything over
to the video analysis room...

71
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:54,812
No.

72
00:06:55,805 --> 00:06:57,102
To my assistant.

73
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,784
There aren't many CCTV
in a rural area like this.

74
00:07:00,063 --> 00:07:01,753
I'll see to that, sir.

75
00:07:04,989 --> 00:07:08,092
But even if it were
attempted murder,

76
00:07:08,092 --> 00:07:09,761
it's not like someone's reported it.

77
00:07:09,761 --> 00:07:12,196
And it has to do
with Chief Prosecutor Chun's family.

78
00:07:12,196 --> 00:07:14,732
If he finds out you've cracked
this open like this,

79
00:07:14,757 --> 00:07:17,516
he won't leave you alone.

80
00:07:18,485 --> 00:07:21,767
Detective Joo, are you standing
behind Chief Prosecutor Chun?

81
00:07:21,767 --> 00:07:22,657
Pardon?

82
00:07:23,608 --> 00:07:26,577
Well, I know that you're standing...

83
00:07:26,577 --> 00:07:28,312
behind Chief Prosecutor Chun.

84
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:34,563
As for me,

85
00:07:34,685 --> 00:07:37,989
I'm not the type to stand behind
someone.

86
00:07:38,289 --> 00:07:40,858
The history between
Chief Prosecutor Chun and I...

87
00:07:40,858 --> 00:07:43,127
go way back, 30 years ago.

88
00:07:45,797 --> 00:07:47,799
He's being sulky.

89
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:52,503
Are you sulking?

90
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,478
I saw him first when he was 13.

91
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:03,147
He had a great interest
in Gong Ji Chul.

92
00:08:04,243 --> 00:08:06,704
So I gave him a book as a gift.

93
00:08:11,781 --> 00:08:13,915
Ma'am, could I briefly see you
today?

94
00:08:13,946 --> 00:08:15,760
I know you're busy.
Tell me where to go.

95
00:08:15,861 --> 00:08:18,229
- Where are you?
- It's near the villa at Sangpyung.

96
00:08:36,853 --> 00:08:37,849
(Mom)

97
00:08:41,258 --> 00:08:42,306
Yes, Mom.

98
00:08:44,062 --> 00:08:45,086
I'm coming now.

99
00:09:08,735 --> 00:09:10,652
Mr. Lee, didn't you say
you can't swim?

100
00:09:10,989 --> 00:09:14,285
You said you were scared of water
after falling into it as a child.

101
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:16,120
- Yes.
- I see.

102
00:09:16,391 --> 00:09:18,656
Then come and stand here.

103
00:09:18,804 --> 00:09:19,853
In front of me.

104
00:09:52,939 --> 00:09:56,694
I apologize, ma'am. I slipped.

105
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:58,696
Right. You can go.

106
00:10:04,962 --> 00:10:07,004
It would've been fun for you.

107
00:10:07,737 --> 00:10:11,037
- when you stared at him drown.
- Was this it?

108
00:10:11,337 --> 00:10:12,737
Is this why you called me?

109
00:10:13,437 --> 00:10:14,704
No way.

110
00:10:17,137 --> 00:10:20,384
Your voice is still so calm
in situations like this.

111
00:10:21,104 --> 00:10:24,922
You have a voice that will hit
people's heart right in the center.

112
00:10:28,237 --> 00:10:30,061
I'm sure this is one of your tastes.

113
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:33,064
Try to put a bigger smile.

114
00:10:35,837 --> 00:10:39,403
I called you here to let you know
that I will never abandon you.

115
00:10:40,537 --> 00:10:42,807
You're not just
the superior one percent.

116
00:10:43,204 --> 00:10:44,709
You are so perfect even...

117
00:10:46,077 --> 00:10:47,729
in the details
that it's breathtaking.

118
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:50,915
Mom.

119
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:56,837
Normal moms usually say that
they won't abandon their kids.

120
00:10:57,904 --> 00:11:00,391
I'd be disappointed if you wanted
a normal mom.

121
00:11:04,137 --> 00:11:06,831
Go first, I'll follow soon.

122
00:11:08,904 --> 00:11:11,369
You never came when I waited.

123
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:14,505
Didn't someone else
always come for me...

124
00:11:15,272 --> 00:11:16,941
instead of you?

125
00:11:17,137 --> 00:11:19,537
That someone else is also me.

126
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:22,013
I sent them personally for you.

127
00:11:27,844 --> 00:11:29,620
You should go first this time.

128
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:31,555
I'll follow.

129
00:11:53,704 --> 00:11:56,614
I haven't been to a theme park
in so long.

130
00:11:56,837 --> 00:11:59,250
Sa Bin's jealous that I went alone.

131
00:12:09,637 --> 00:12:11,137
(W studio apartment)

132
00:12:17,204 --> 00:12:19,670
A blue car.

133
00:12:19,737 --> 00:12:21,604
Who are you looking for?

134
00:12:21,606 --> 00:12:23,854
Why are you doing this
in a dumb way?

135
00:12:23,996 --> 00:12:26,173
- I'm busy.
- Don't be like that.

136
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:28,503
You have a part-timer
at the cashier.

137
00:12:28,505 --> 00:12:30,010
Let me see a bit more.

138
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:36,641
Stop. Stop right there.
Rewind a bit.

139
00:12:36,643 --> 00:12:37,939
Stop right there.

140
00:12:38,504 --> 00:12:41,625
R. M. Bike.

141
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:47,643
Prosecutor, I have it.

142
00:12:47,645 --> 00:12:50,259
Jong Bum's bike was caught
on camera.

143
00:12:50,537 --> 00:12:54,182
Yes. The RM bike logo was...

144
00:12:54,204 --> 00:12:57,108
on the body and the wheels. Yes.

145
00:12:57,431 --> 00:13:02,613
The license plate is
Seoul Seocho Da 6037.

146
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:08,909
The bike caught on camera just
passed right by me.

147
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:12,221
- Is it Jong Bum for sure?
- He has his helmet on...

148
00:13:12,223 --> 00:13:13,791
so I'm not sure.

149
00:13:14,004 --> 00:13:17,461
But it's the same bike
I tailed last time.

150
00:13:17,904 --> 00:13:20,706
The footage from the
convenience store was taken...

151
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:24,035
at 2:30 p.m. on the day of the case.

152
00:13:24,377 --> 00:13:27,963
There was a female student
at the back of his bike.

153
00:13:27,965 --> 00:13:29,498
- A female student?
- Yes.

154
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:35,066
Her uniform is from
Sanjong High School nearby.

155
00:13:35,237 --> 00:13:37,615
I'll drop by and find out more.

156
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:01,768
I'd like to talk about
Chun Jong Bum today.

157
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:04,583
By the way, is she okay?

158
00:14:04,662 --> 00:14:07,021
The person you saved at the lake.

159
00:14:08,404 --> 00:14:12,449
I was surprised. I didn't know
you could be so heroic.

160
00:14:13,137 --> 00:14:15,686
I thought you were
a rational person.

161
00:14:16,604 --> 00:14:19,757
But jumping in to save some other
women in front of your fiance?

162
00:14:21,788 --> 00:14:25,914
- If you're worried about Sang Ah...
- It's just a curiosity.

163
00:14:26,582 --> 00:14:28,379
You don't bat an eye...

164
00:14:28,381 --> 00:14:31,505
when a man you framed
killed himself in prison.

165
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:35,739
But how could you be
so philanthropic at that moment?

166
00:14:36,429 --> 00:14:39,969
- Framed?
- I picked it up somewhere.

167
00:14:40,258 --> 00:14:44,259
Someone's after you because
of his brother's innocent death.

168
00:14:47,404 --> 00:14:48,778
Who would that be?

169
00:14:49,536 --> 00:14:50,958
I thought you knew.

170
00:14:51,715 --> 00:14:53,557
I think it was Seo Tae Ha.

171
00:14:54,186 --> 00:14:55,893
And his brother's name is
Seo Sung Ha.

172
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:58,470
Seo Tae Ha.

173
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:01,704
And his brother Seo Sung Ha.

174
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:07,091
Seo Sung Ha wasn't framed.

175
00:15:07,093 --> 00:15:09,150
That pedophile snooped
around the daycare center...

176
00:15:09,152 --> 00:15:10,135
every time he got out of jail.

177
00:15:10,137 --> 00:15:11,958
Even if he was a pedophile,

178
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:16,168
no prosecutor should frame someone
for something he hasn't done.

179
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:18,182
I'm sorry, but I came here...

180
00:15:18,882 --> 00:15:22,019
to hear what Jong Bum is copying
from Gong Ji Chul.

181
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:25,923
I hear they are both a part
of your major.

182
00:15:31,257 --> 00:15:32,731
I guess you're not going after...

183
00:15:32,733 --> 00:15:36,101
the real killer of Hwa Young's case
because of Jong Bum.

184
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:41,028
You think after Jong Bum read
my book,

185
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:43,774
he copied the Yellow umbrella case.

186
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:48,002
But why do you disregard Gong
Ji Chul from your suspect list?

187
00:15:48,004 --> 00:15:49,213
Gong Ji Chul?

188
00:15:51,502 --> 00:15:53,268
My book is fictional.

189
00:15:54,137 --> 00:15:58,322
It has facts hidden in lies,
like hide-and-seek.

190
00:15:59,037 --> 00:16:03,902
Do you think the last page is
fictional or real?

191
00:16:03,904 --> 00:16:05,559
You keep dodging my questions.

192
00:16:05,957 --> 00:16:07,464
I'll be going now.

193
00:16:07,837 --> 00:16:09,967
I don't have time to play
games with you.

194
00:16:12,225 --> 00:16:13,191
Wait.

195
00:16:20,337 --> 00:16:23,270
("You may have just met
Gong Ji Chul.")

196
00:16:26,793 --> 00:16:28,621
There's a guard...

197
00:16:28,715 --> 00:16:32,389
who saw Ji Chul walk out alive
from the morgue.

198
00:16:38,949 --> 00:16:42,316
Sir, I checked the prison where
Gong Ji Chul was executed.

199
00:16:42,318 --> 00:16:46,918
May 31st, 1988. There were
three executioners for Ji Chul.

200
00:16:47,395 --> 00:16:49,487
Gu Won Jin, Hwang Jung Eui,
and Jung Sung Hoon.

201
00:16:49,537 --> 00:16:52,910
The first two are already deceased.

202
00:16:52,982 --> 00:16:54,511
But Jeong Sung Hoon is still alive.

203
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,215
Where does he live?

204
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:04,404
Seolin-dong 36-2, Sangheun-gu,
Yongin-si, Gyunggi-do.

205
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:06,884
Jung Sung Eun is at
Dasarang Nursing Hospital.

206
00:17:07,336 --> 00:17:08,992
(Seolin-dong 36-2, Sangheun-gu,
Yongin-si, Gyunggi-do.)

207
00:17:09,137 --> 00:17:11,570
Make sure you walk
my dad twice today.

208
00:17:11,637 --> 00:17:14,031
They shouldn't be too long.
Just 30 minutes each.

209
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:16,243
He likes flowers.

210
00:17:16,245 --> 00:17:20,204
I went to a tulip festival with him
when I was young.

211
00:17:21,204 --> 00:17:25,142
Please don't let him see anyone
besides me and my uncles.

212
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,637
What is he up to?

213
00:17:28,704 --> 00:17:31,370
He keeps writing
something down these days.

214
00:17:31,437 --> 00:17:35,070
I think it's to remember
whenever his mind comes back.

215
00:17:37,037 --> 00:17:40,758
Could you tell him I love him?

216
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:54,638
Let's pretend that confession
didn't happen.

217
00:17:55,604 --> 00:17:57,508
I have a fiancee.

218
00:18:04,604 --> 00:18:06,241
My wedding invitation will
be out soon.

219
00:18:06,243 --> 00:18:07,611
I'll send you one if you'd like one.

220
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:17,737
I must be crazy.

222
00:18:49,046 --> 00:18:50,146
How did you...

223
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:54,190
You must come here often.

224
00:18:54,572 --> 00:18:55,732
What book are you reading?

225
00:19:00,068 --> 00:19:01,892
Are you planning to stay here
on this sunny day?

226
00:19:01,894 --> 00:19:04,333
Yes, I like it here.

227
00:19:05,037 --> 00:19:08,378
I need to master
someone's mind today.

228
00:19:12,282 --> 00:19:13,784
You're not buying this, are you?

229
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:18,604
Hey. What's he doing?

230
00:19:21,639 --> 00:19:23,502
We have somewhere to go. Let's go.

231
00:19:23,504 --> 00:19:26,791
I told you I don't want to go.
What's wrong with you?

232
00:19:58,037 --> 00:20:01,231
- I'll go get us drinks.
- I want a pineapple drink.

233
00:20:43,147 --> 00:20:45,427
You wanted to come with me
to an arcade?

234
00:20:46,297 --> 00:20:48,251
Actually, I wanted to ride
a roller coaster with you.

235
00:20:48,544 --> 00:20:50,924
How are we going to ride
a roller coaster here?

236
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:12,181
Wait a minute.

237
00:21:12,183 --> 00:21:14,460
This is a scary one, is it?
You know what,

238
00:21:14,462 --> 00:21:17,217
I've never been
on any rides in my life.

239
00:21:17,217 --> 00:21:18,508
You can hold on to me
if you get scared.

240
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:22,977
We're going.

241
00:21:27,497 --> 00:21:29,063
This feels real.

242
00:21:41,127 --> 00:21:42,384
I was surprised.

243
00:21:59,683 --> 00:22:03,403
This feels like my heart stays still
and only my body is falling.

244

But let's do this again.

that my son got hurt.

Where is the room
for patient Jung Sung Eun?

Visits other than family have been
prohibited by his daughter.

I'm the daughter's friend.

What is the daughter's name?

256

Her name was...

257
00:24:04,187 --> 00:24:06,752
Ma'am!
Jung Sung Eun has disappeared.

258
00:24:06,754 --> 00:24:09,546
I surely saw him at the concert.

259
00:24:09,697 --> 00:24:11,322
I told you to keep an eye on him.

260

I told you he would go out
whenever he had the chance.

261

Where is the caregiver?

262
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,988
Where did he go?

323
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:49,570
Did you come to look for my dad?

324
00:31:49,572 --> 00:31:50,605
Why?

325
00:31:54,218 --> 00:31:56,870
Is he too hungry to talk?

326
00:31:56,968 --> 00:31:58,372
You should move him
to another hospital.

327
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,391
That hospital will accept
any visitor...

328
00:32:00,391 --> 00:32:02,176
even if you requested
no visitors except for the family.

329
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,278
- Sorry?
- Ms. Jung Sa Bin.

330
00:32:05,094 --> 00:32:08,118
Judo, Taekwondo, and Hapkido.
Did you train in any martial art?

331
00:32:08,118 --> 00:32:09,883
Well, there isn't any.

332
00:32:09,883 --> 00:32:10,884
I warned you.

333
00:32:11,055 --> 00:32:12,665
Don't interfere
in someone else's business.

334
00:32:13,751 --> 00:32:17,057
What were you thinking rushing at
a gangster with a knife, unarmed?

335
00:32:17,703 --> 00:32:18,688
And...

336
00:32:19,087 --> 00:32:22,094
don't you know jumping into the
water to save someone is suicidal?

337
00:32:22,094 --> 00:32:24,498
You jumped in too.

338
00:32:25,227 --> 00:32:26,415
Also,

339
00:32:26,415 --> 00:32:29,203
you should keep those kinds
of concerns for your girlfriend.

340
00:32:30,352 --> 00:32:33,140
Don't ever save me whether I fall
in the water or not.

341
00:32:33,516 --> 00:32:35,943
There are many others who could
save me, other than you.

342
00:32:36,462 --> 00:32:39,688
I'm merely a passerby to you.

343
00:32:39,688 --> 00:32:41,448
You know the passerby in a movie?

344
00:32:41,816 --> 00:32:43,084
It's something like that.

345
00:32:44,227 --> 00:32:45,739
Is there anything you want to add?

346
00:34:30,516 --> 00:34:32,059
What brings you here?

347
00:34:40,095 --> 00:34:41,571
Do you live here, Sa Bin?

348
00:34:42,032 --> 00:34:44,271
I have a regular customer here
for my part-time errand.

349
00:34:44,477 --> 00:34:46,860
We cross each other too many times.

350
00:34:47,453 --> 00:34:49,657
You live alone on the floor
above my uncle's...

351
00:34:49,657 --> 00:34:51,645
and you have a part-time job
in the building I live in.

352
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,448
We also met at the bookstore.

353
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:56,140
Don't you think that would make
him a stalker?

354
00:34:58,398 --> 00:35:00,589
I think a stalker is better
than dating two people.

355
00:35:01,469 --> 00:35:03,156
At least he'd focus on one woman.

356
00:35:07,625 --> 00:35:11,498
Go home safely, Prosecutor Kim.

357
00:35:12,561 --> 00:35:14,155
Why don't we grab something to eat?

358
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:16,703
I was paid for my part-time job,
so I'm buying.

359
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:20,069
Stores should be closed by now.

360
00:35:20,071 --> 00:35:21,796
The convenience store is open.
Let's go.

361
00:35:39,102 --> 00:35:41,314
I was worried when you left before.

362
00:35:44,117 --> 00:35:45,308
Pomegranate...

363
00:35:46,313 --> 00:35:47,668
is supposed to be good
for the heart.

364
00:35:48,555 --> 00:35:49,484
Try it.

365
00:35:49,555 --> 00:35:53,107
Is something healthy
what I need right now?

366
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:21,396
Sense of loss.

367
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:36,016
I've run an errand that involved
listening to someone's secret.

368
00:36:36,774 --> 00:36:38,485
I'll listen to yours and forget
all about it.

369
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:42,122
Think of me as a wall...

370
00:36:42,186 --> 00:36:43,223
and talk to me.

371
00:36:43,734 --> 00:36:44,559
A wall?

372
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:47,360
All right. From now on,

373
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,263
can you promise not to make
any reaction at all?

374
00:36:53,516 --> 00:36:55,736
I hope it's because of this man.

375
00:36:56,665 --> 00:36:58,063
A heart has...

376
00:36:58,063 --> 00:37:00,907
nerves and memory cells too.

377
00:37:01,328 --> 00:37:02,135
But...

378
00:37:03,079 --> 00:37:04,811
the death-row convict...

379
00:37:05,157 --> 00:37:06,747
should be 42 years old now.

380
00:37:08,821 --> 00:37:11,585
He would not have felt the way I do.

381
00:37:12,102 --> 00:37:14,021
I feel uneasy...

382
00:37:14,423 --> 00:37:15,689
but...

383
00:37:16,102 --> 00:37:18,625
it's like this part is breaking
meanwhile.

384
00:37:19,493 --> 00:37:22,329
What could this be explained by?

385
00:37:22,548 --> 00:37:24,831
What memory does this heart have?

386
00:37:26,274 --> 00:37:27,634
This...

387
00:37:28,196 --> 00:37:30,337
is not fake like virtual reality.

388
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:33,836
I'm hurting so much here.

389
00:37:34,766 --> 00:37:37,039
Sometimes I can't even breathe.

390
00:37:38,571 --> 00:37:39,938
How could this man...

391
00:37:40,688 --> 00:37:43,116
be so vivid?

392
00:37:44,336 --> 00:37:47,487
I could still feel...

393
00:37:47,813 --> 00:37:49,723
his hands holding mine
in the water.

394
00:37:55,117 --> 00:37:56,667
It was so painful...

395
00:37:59,086 --> 00:38:01,307
and painful...

396
00:38:02,454 --> 00:38:05,205
that I hope my heart stops beating.

397
00:38:21,415 --> 00:38:23,824
It shouldn't be your heart
that should stop beating.

398
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:42,305
Don't look...

399
00:38:43,766 --> 00:38:44,995
at that man anymore.

400
00:38:46,977 --> 00:38:48,315
It'll be okay if don't look at him.

401
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,695
I'll help you do that.

402
00:38:54,633 --> 00:38:56,060
People change.

403
00:38:57,282 --> 00:38:59,192
Why do you love people
who are prone to change?

404
00:39:00,235 --> 00:39:01,228
How about you?

405
00:39:01,446 --> 00:39:02,469
Won't you change?

406
00:39:02,471 --> 00:39:04,431
- I won't.
- You won't?

407
00:39:04,703 --> 00:39:05,767
No, I won't.

408
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:07,619
You're human too.

409
00:39:07,621 --> 00:39:08,979
Aren't you?

410
00:39:10,391 --> 00:39:12,606
I only love the ones I choose.

411
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,688
I'm not human.

412
00:39:30,844 --> 00:39:32,893
I've never seen a human being.

413
00:39:33,578 --> 00:39:35,008
You can win over it.

414
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:37,230
Fight the monster in you.

415
00:39:38,212 --> 00:39:39,533
I'll help you...

416
00:39:39,937 --> 00:39:40,894
to fight it.

417
00:39:45,484 --> 00:39:47,174
He's the only one
I should get rid of.

418
00:40:10,071 --> 00:40:11,665
It can't be.

419
00:40:43,336 --> 00:40:45,837
That's an excellent performance
every time I hear.

420
00:40:51,645 --> 00:40:53,087
You found your way here.

421
00:40:53,113 --> 00:40:54,916
I heard you were released,

422
00:40:55,197 --> 00:40:56,731
but wasn't that enough for you?

423
00:41:03,823 --> 00:41:07,524
She has no relation to me,
so take her name down from now.

424
00:41:09,262 --> 00:41:11,262
- A woman?
- You jerk.

425
00:41:11,322 --> 00:41:13,250
He does not deal with women.

426
00:41:13,266 --> 00:41:14,280
Is that so?

427
00:41:14,468 --> 00:41:16,769
Is that why you crashed into my car
with your truck back then?

428
00:41:16,794 --> 00:41:18,671
I was sorry about that.

429
00:41:18,696 --> 00:41:19,917
Who's that woman?

430
00:41:20,551 --> 00:41:21,685
Is it your fiancee?

431
00:41:21,718 --> 00:41:23,673
That's my privacy.

432
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:25,344
That makes me more curious.

433
00:41:25,378 --> 00:41:27,981
You came all the way here
for a girl you don't care about?

434
00:41:31,302 --> 00:41:33,270
You want to mess with women again,
don't you?

435
00:41:33,766 --> 00:41:35,700
I only deal with beasts.

436
00:41:36,937 --> 00:41:40,471
Your brother Seo Sung Ha,
a pedophile.

437
00:41:41,853 --> 00:41:45,987
Do you expect your brother to be
normal while you live like this?

438
00:41:57,619 --> 00:42:00,785
Revenge is what humans do,

439
00:42:00,814 --> 00:42:02,248
not beasts like you.

440
00:42:02,273 --> 00:42:04,296
That's what qualifies revenge.

441
00:42:09,885 --> 00:42:11,885
That scumbag.

442
00:42:19,799 --> 00:42:22,195
Stick by and keep on eye
on a woman at the NFS.

443
00:42:22,235 --> 00:42:23,502
At the NFS?

444
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:44,497
Su Hyuk, you know we have to see
our wedding presents today, right?

445
00:42:57,904 --> 00:43:00,171
There are 13 days left
until our wedding.

446
00:43:00,196 --> 00:43:03,134
Do you know you still haven't
proposed properly yet?

447
00:43:05,329 --> 00:43:06,888
I would have done it
if you wanted me to.

448
00:43:06,913 --> 00:43:09,014
- Do it for me now then.
- Now?

449
00:43:47,377 --> 00:43:51,585
I'm happy just looking at you.

450
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:54,303
I'm happy just looking at you.

451
00:43:55,528 --> 00:43:59,429
I'll be happy to have been
your husband when I die...

452
00:44:00,166 --> 00:44:04,433
and I'll live on reminiscing this
moment if you die.

453
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:26,766
Su Hyuk.

454
00:44:30,146 --> 00:44:31,613
Oh, sorry.

455
00:44:34,801 --> 00:44:36,330
I'm at the NFS.

456
00:44:36,469 --> 00:44:39,551
I'm following Sa Bin like
you told me to.

457
00:44:39,956 --> 00:44:42,290
But why is Seo Tae Ha here?

458
00:44:46,075 --> 00:44:47,897
I'm sorry. I have to go somewhere.

459
00:44:47,922 --> 00:44:49,255
What? Why?

460
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,581
I'll call you later.

461
00:45:16,244 --> 00:45:17,411
Kim Su Hyuk.

462
00:45:17,889 --> 00:45:19,390
This will be fun.

463
00:45:46,806 --> 00:45:50,040
Can't we at least say hello?

464
00:45:52,792 --> 00:45:54,626
I thought we had nothing to
do with each other.

465
00:45:55,039 --> 00:45:56,910
Didn't you say that?

466
00:46:06,333 --> 00:46:09,766
Hey, Sa Bin.
Did you meet Prosecutor Kim?

467
00:46:09,791 --> 00:46:11,892
He was looking for you.

468
00:46:12,148 --> 00:46:14,582
Me? When?

469
00:46:14,607 --> 00:46:16,359
Around ten minutes ago.

470
00:46:16,436 --> 00:46:20,448
I thought something was about to
happen between you two.

471
00:46:20,473 --> 00:46:24,174
His face was deadly serious.

472
00:46:46,918 --> 00:46:48,943
This is 911, how can we help you?

473
00:46:48,968 --> 00:46:50,468
I have something to ask you.

474
00:46:51,271 --> 00:46:53,938
If you ride the ambulance from the
NFS junction, where do you go to?

475
00:46:53,974 --> 00:46:58,140
You go to Jisung for IM and
Inju University ER for surgery.

476
00:46:58,169 --> 00:47:00,203
Do you have an emergency patient
with you?

477
00:47:10,850 --> 00:47:12,050
Thank you.

478
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:20,001
Hey, what are you doing here?

479
00:47:20,734 --> 00:47:21,901
How did you get in here?

480
00:47:23,416 --> 00:47:25,952
I'm glad you look okay.

481
00:47:25,972 --> 00:47:27,219
You're glad?

482
00:47:27,244 --> 00:47:28,783
Are you crazy?

483
00:47:28,785 --> 00:47:30,354
Where do you think you're sitting?

484
00:47:33,283 --> 00:47:34,850
I have something to ask you.

485
00:47:35,328 --> 00:47:39,129
Why would you kill someone
for someone else?

486
00:47:39,152 --> 00:47:41,386
- What?
- I'm here to ask you that.

487
00:47:51,831 --> 00:47:53,599
Blind hatred.

488
00:47:54,834 --> 00:47:57,235
Beat it before I stab you.

489
00:48:01,608 --> 00:48:03,675
I guess I was expecting too much.

490
00:48:06,646 --> 00:48:07,646
Hey.

491
00:48:10,302 --> 00:48:12,070
Do you know what family is?

492
00:48:16,747 --> 00:48:19,682
I was a knife fodder since I was 15.

493
00:48:20,083 --> 00:48:21,394
Do you know what that is?

494
00:48:21,638 --> 00:48:23,972
You stand in front of fights,
so you can be a human shield.

495
00:48:24,504 --> 00:48:26,197
If you survive the stabbing?

496
00:48:26,499 --> 00:48:28,499
You go back out to
get stabbed again.

497
00:48:28,768 --> 00:48:30,603
I lived to die.

498
00:48:31,203 --> 00:48:34,904
And Tae Ha took me in as a family.

499
00:48:35,234 --> 00:48:37,234
Do you know what he taught me?

500
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:39,691
You live to live.

501
00:48:41,314 --> 00:48:43,314
If that's family, I think
I understand.

502
00:48:43,939 --> 00:48:46,306
A murder to protect your family.

503
00:48:46,967 --> 00:48:50,584
But, why can't you kill
someone today?

504
00:48:52,022 --> 00:48:54,132
- I thought he was your family.
- What?

505
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,628
Do you know how many John Doe
remains come up in Korea?

506
00:48:57,297 --> 00:49:00,831
A hundred? A thousand?

507
00:49:01,434 --> 00:49:02,635
Or more?

508
00:49:08,825 --> 00:49:11,593
Then how many do you think
your boss has killed?

509
00:49:12,392 --> 00:49:14,592
Like Kim Su Hyuk did
to Byun Sung Hoon.

510
00:49:15,949 --> 00:49:18,082
If he makes your boss
a serial killer.

511
00:49:18,107 --> 00:49:20,408
What are you?

512
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:22,854
I owe something to Kim Su Hyuk.

513
00:49:23,419 --> 00:49:24,652
Just like you.

514
00:50:07,861 --> 00:50:08,928
Sorry, I'm late.

515
00:50:09,312 --> 00:50:10,345
Take a seat.

516
00:50:16,176 --> 00:50:18,176
I like everything about you,

517
00:50:18,912 --> 00:50:20,934
except you take things too far.

518
00:50:21,134 --> 00:50:22,709
Byung Sung Hoon or Lim Hwa Young...

519
00:50:23,413 --> 00:50:25,529
just go as much as I tell you to.

520
00:50:34,606 --> 00:50:35,985
It's Chun Jong Bum.

521
00:50:36,723 --> 00:50:37,993
This photo was taken...

522
00:50:38,501 --> 00:50:40,471
at 2:30 p.m. on April 7th.

523
00:50:41,343 --> 00:50:43,430
The party started at six...

524
00:50:43,759 --> 00:50:46,010
but why would Jong Bum
be there at that time?

525
00:50:47,922 --> 00:50:49,509
The student at the back
of his motorcycle.

526
00:50:49,914 --> 00:50:53,451
She fell in the same spot that
Jong Woo fell in.

527
00:50:54,619 --> 00:50:56,587
Jong Bum saved her
on top of the bridge...

528
00:50:57,001 --> 00:50:59,223
and took her to the hospital.

529
00:50:59,751 --> 00:51:00,907
So what?

530
00:51:00,954 --> 00:51:03,728
The off-limit sign was there
until the party started...

531
00:51:04,142 --> 00:51:06,931
but it disappeared at the moment
that Jong Woo fell in the water.

532
00:51:06,931 --> 00:51:08,134
Is it a coincidence?

533
00:51:15,149 --> 00:51:16,477
What are you trying to say?

534
00:51:18,064 --> 00:51:21,679
Jong Bum will try to kill
Jong Woo again.

535
00:51:22,795 --> 00:51:24,749
He won't give up...

536
00:51:25,110 --> 00:51:26,438
until he kills Jong Woo.

537
00:51:35,766 --> 00:51:36,836
What...

538
00:51:38,341 --> 00:51:40,221
are you trying to prove?

539
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:48,453
The real Jong Bum.

540
00:51:50,435 --> 00:51:52,932
You know what that is, don't you?

541
00:51:53,634 --> 00:51:56,847
The person I met at the
end of both cases was...

542
00:51:57,832 --> 00:51:59,155
Chun Jong Bum.

543
00:52:03,657 --> 00:52:06,757
If I do know, does it make
a difference?

544
00:52:08,118 --> 00:52:11,596
Why can't you let go of Jong Bum?

545
00:52:13,110 --> 00:52:14,438
Is it because he's my son?

546
00:52:19,532 --> 00:52:20,579
You...

547
00:52:21,945 --> 00:52:23,530
only need to think of one thing.

548
00:52:25,412 --> 00:52:28,112
What you will gain and lose
by going after my son.

549
00:52:31,242 --> 00:52:32,532
Decide right now.

550
00:52:33,938 --> 00:52:37,355
Either rip the photo in front of me
and put the USB drive here or...

551
00:52:39,196 --> 00:52:40,430
leave now.

552
00:53:28,501 --> 00:53:30,556
Put Chun Jong Bum on the
suspect list of Lim's case...

553
00:53:30,558 --> 00:53:32,144
and start from square one.

554
00:53:52,274 --> 00:53:53,998
How did my dad do today?

555
00:53:54,383 --> 00:53:56,139
Did he look for me?

556
00:53:56,434 --> 00:53:58,634
I was going to tell you.

557
00:53:58,751 --> 00:54:01,505
He was thinking straight today...

558
00:54:02,173 --> 00:54:04,241
and was writing a lot of notes.

559
00:54:06,329 --> 00:54:08,188
He was like that when I was young.

560
00:54:08,481 --> 00:54:10,648
He used to open his note
while sitting on the sofa...

561
00:54:10,648 --> 00:54:12,950
and kept writing notes
again and again.

562
00:54:41,212 --> 00:54:43,214
April 9, 2020.

563
00:54:43,514 --> 00:54:45,583
A lady came to visit me.

564
00:54:46,188 --> 00:54:49,520
The ninth was...

565
00:54:52,532 --> 00:54:55,248
She said someone was trying
to kill my daughter.

566
00:55:01,735 --> 00:55:03,470
She played the violin.

567
00:55:04,233 --> 00:55:06,258
She had a sharp voice.

568
00:55:06,993 --> 00:55:08,665
Her glare was frightening.

569
00:55:14,414 --> 00:55:17,383
It's him, Gong Ji Chul.

570
00:56:03,079 --> 00:56:05,633
I need someone to help my daughter.

571
00:56:29,548 --> 00:56:32,957
Sa Bin, remember two kinds of eyes.

572
00:56:33,664 --> 00:56:35,793
The eyes
that are trying to kill you...

573
00:56:36,438 --> 00:56:38,395
and those who are trying
to save you.

574
00:56:47,794 --> 00:56:51,275
(Prosecutor Kim Su Hyuk)

575
00:57:29,648 --> 00:57:32,062
Why is she acting that way?

576
00:57:32,813 --> 00:57:33,873
Go talk to her.

577
00:57:36,977 --> 00:57:38,522
You should leave her alone...

578
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:40,688
in times like that.

579
00:57:41,225 --> 00:57:43,861
Sa Bin was like that
when she was 14.

580
00:57:43,992 --> 00:57:47,131
She gulped down soft drinks...

581
00:57:47,131 --> 00:57:48,532
the whole night.

582
00:57:48,750 --> 00:57:52,024
But she can't even drink that well.

583
00:57:52,049 --> 00:57:53,771
You don't know anything.

584
00:57:53,849 --> 00:57:55,706
It's not that she can't drink.

585
00:57:55,731 --> 00:57:59,710
Sa Bin takes after me
and she drinks like a fish.

586
00:57:59,782 --> 00:58:01,067
How can you say that?

587
00:58:35,867 --> 00:58:37,695
If Kim Su Hyuk is beside you,

588
00:58:38,382 --> 00:58:40,274
you and your father will die.

589
00:59:02,773 --> 00:59:04,594
Prosecutor Kim,

590
00:59:05,109 --> 00:59:08,379
I know I'm crossing the line...

591
00:59:08,773 --> 00:59:11,293
and I also know
I shouldn't be doing this.

592
00:59:11,519 --> 00:59:14,184
But don't get hurt, please.

593
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:16,048
Don't hurt yourself.

594
00:59:16,563 --> 00:59:18,969
What was that?
Have you been drinking?

595
00:59:19,209 --> 00:59:21,852
Who sent that note?

596
00:59:22,938 --> 00:59:26,697
Who is trying to kill me...

597
00:59:27,037 --> 00:59:30,642
and my father and even you?

598
00:59:31,258 --> 00:59:34,817
Who in the world is
trying to kill you?

599
00:59:37,648 --> 00:59:39,392
How much have you been drinking?

600
00:59:39,471 --> 00:59:41,104
Let me talk to your friend.

601
00:59:43,008 --> 00:59:45,349
- Are you by yourself?
- You looked down...

602
00:59:45,931 --> 00:59:49,977
on me because I don't know
any judo, taekwondo, and hapkido.

603
00:59:50,364 --> 00:59:52,356
Fighting is not done by technique...

604
00:59:53,165 --> 00:59:56,593
but by your heart.

605
00:59:57,696 --> 01:00:00,898
I'm not scared of knives...

606
01:00:00,983 --> 01:00:02,499
or even guns.

607
01:00:03,164 --> 01:00:06,804
I only put my eyes to the person...

608
01:00:07,259 --> 01:00:08,472
that I need to protect.

609
01:00:08,472 --> 01:00:09,634
Where are you right now?

610
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:12,205

Aren't you bad luck? Someone always
gets hurt when you're together.

618
01:03:45,522 --> 01:03:47,090
Am I not the one you wanted to kill?

- A motive can't be given by others.
- I can't control myself.

It's the first time I want to kill
someone for someone I like.

Is it a coincidence
that the diary is gone?

the suspect.
