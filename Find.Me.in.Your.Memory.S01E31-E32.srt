1
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:28,895
(Episode 31)

2
00:01:28,919 --> 00:01:30,666
Hey, isn't that Yeo Ha Jin?

3
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:31,690
Where?

4
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,460
No way.

5
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,429
She's in the US right now.

6
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:37,806
Oh, you're right.

7
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,839
Do you think
she won't come back to Korea?

8
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:41,575
I doubt she'll come back.

9
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:43,585
I heard she's really popular there.

10
00:01:43,609 --> 00:01:46,085
I heard she'll be filming
"Kill the Venus 3" too.

11
00:01:46,109 --> 00:01:47,839
Really? She's so big.

12
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:52,555
Here's your coffee.

13
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:53,726
I ordered chocolate.

14
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,226
I canceled it for you.

15
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,995
Do you think I can drink chocolate
before I die?

16
00:01:57,019 --> 00:01:59,135
You can probably have some
when you're about 60.

17
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:00,536
That's earlier than I thought.

18
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,420
The sunlight is great in Korea.

19
00:02:03,429 --> 00:02:05,165
Is it different from the US?

20
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:07,536
Of course. It even smells different.

21
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,520
The lack of sugar is
making you way too sensitive.

22
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,369
How is it for you
to be back in Korea?

23
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,340
It's great.

24
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,539
Goodness, my babies.
You two were here already.

25
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,409
- You're here.
- Hey.

26
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,885
Wait, is coffee enough for you?

27
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:24,286
Aren't you hungry?

28
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,426
We're fine. We already had lunch.

29
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:28,555
I'm almost finished
getting your home ready.

30
00:02:28,579 --> 00:02:30,250
You can come back home.

31
00:02:30,349 --> 00:02:31,426
What about your niece?

32
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:34,165
She must've been flustered that
she suddenly had to empty the house.

33
00:02:34,189 --> 00:02:36,135
Exactly.
We could've stayed at a hotel.

34
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:38,236
Goodness, you'll be
way more comfortable at home.

35
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,406
Thanks to you, she was
practically living there for free...

36
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:42,406
in return for
taking care of your house.

37
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,945
I gave her some money
to go travel for a few days.

38
00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:47,245
She's completely excited right now.

39
00:02:47,269 --> 00:02:48,439
I'm glad.

40
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,885
So the meeting with the director
will be held tomorrow, right?

41
00:02:51,909 --> 00:02:53,915
He wanted to
book the meeting for today,

42
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:56,355
but I asked him to postpone it
because you have to...

43
00:02:56,379 --> 00:02:57,450
take a rest today.

44
00:02:58,049 --> 00:03:01,150
Do you absolutely love the scenario?

45
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,989
I do.

46
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:07,236
But I'll decide
after I meet the director.

47
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,706
Okay.
This is urgent for them, not us.

48
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,965
Slowly.
Let's take our time and think.

49
00:03:11,989 --> 00:03:13,629
Slowly.

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,075
Ms. Park, do you have to keep adding
English to your vocabulary?

51
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:18,445
I have to keep trying to get better.

52
00:03:18,469 --> 00:03:20,376
Ha Jin is now a star worldwide,

53
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,275
and I should be able to speak...

54
00:03:22,299 --> 00:03:24,585
proper English
as the CEO of her agency.

55
00:03:24,609 --> 00:03:27,109
Exactly.
You need to speak it properly.

56
00:03:28,109 --> 00:03:29,086
It was just a joke.

57
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,726
"Joke", no. Joke.

58
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,750
Joke.

59
00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:33,719
Exactly.

60
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:53,169
(Ju Ri and Woo Hyun's Happy Place)

61
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:17,705
Nothing has changed.

62
00:04:17,729 --> 00:04:21,105
They loved the decoration,
so they left it as it is.

63
00:04:21,129 --> 00:04:23,000
The second floor is
almost the same too.

64
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,169
You can clear your mind
and get a good rest today.

65
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:27,347
I will.

66
00:04:27,371 --> 00:04:30,316
We have to go back to the office
right away. Is that okay?

67
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,216
It's all right. I'll get some rest.

68
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,586
We'd rather stay with you,

69
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:36,226
but we have mountains of work
after staying away for so long.

70
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,080
We're very busy.

71
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:40,726
Don't get too strained.
You need to look after your health.

72
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,120
Yes, I'll do that.

73
00:04:42,379 --> 00:04:44,289
- Get a good rest, then.
- Goodbye.

74
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,795
I'll get something delicious
on my way home.

75
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:47,936
Do you want anything?

76
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,605
No. Go work,

77
00:04:49,629 --> 00:04:51,389
eat dinner, and go on a date too.

78
00:04:52,289 --> 00:04:54,330
You haven't called Mr. Jo yet,
have you?

79
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:55,629
No.

80
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,830
He'll be thrilled to see you.

81
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:02,300
I want to be alone,
so you need to go.

82
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,039
Okay.

83
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,885
Text me if you want anything.

84
00:05:05,909 --> 00:05:07,485
Don't go out alone.

85
00:05:07,509 --> 00:05:08,509
Okay.

86
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:22,219
(Dear my Ha Kyung.
My dear Ha Kyung! How was your day?)

87
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,979
I miss my Ha Kyung.

88
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,519
I wonder what she's doing right now.

89
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:56,490
Hello?

90
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:57,790
Hey, Ha Kyung!

91
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:02,469
Why isn't this
an international call?

92
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,100
What do you think?

93
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,399
I'm in Korea right now.

94
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:07,839
Really?

95
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,716
Where are you? I'll be there.

96
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,639
Are you at home?
I'll be there in 10 minutes.

97
00:06:26,689 --> 00:06:27,689
Ha Kyung...

98
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,060
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

99
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:35,100
Jo Il Kwon!

100
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,810
What was that just now?

101
00:06:43,209 --> 00:06:44,209
What?

102
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:56,790
What's wrong?

103
00:06:57,689 --> 00:06:58,896
Don't you know?

104
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,396
Who was that guy just now?

105
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,495
Who is he that you gave him a hug?

106
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:05,206
He's someone from the agency
in the US, and he gave me a ride.

107
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,776
And that wasn't even a hug.

108
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,576
I was just saying goodbye.

109
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,069
That's not just saying goodbye.

110
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:12,505
If you said goodbye to him again,
things will get even more heated up.

111
00:07:12,529 --> 00:07:14,076
Everyone does that in the US.

112
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,346
Will you keep getting angry
over nothing?

113
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:19,579
Are you saying you hugged
any old guy you met over there?

114
00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:20,839
What?

115
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,685
Why are you so uptight today?

116
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:25,125
What about you?
You must feel very free...

117
00:07:25,149 --> 00:07:27,526
after staying in the US for a while.
You seem very open.

118
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:29,925
We finally met after a long time.
Will you keep making me tired?

119
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,120
"Tired"?

120
00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:33,495
If you're tired,
go home and get some rest.

121
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:35,389
Why did you come all the way here?

122
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,829
Fine! I should do that!

123
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,560
What?

124
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,930
I'm leaving!

125
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:44,670
Fine! Goodbye, then.

126
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,240
Okay!

127
00:07:51,509 --> 00:07:53,439
How could she really leave?

128
00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:19,540
Ha Kyung, are you still angry?

129
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:22,476
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

130
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,216
I like you too much,

131
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,839
so that's why
I must've been jealous.

132
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,810
Can we meet and talk it out?

133
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,055
I miss you, Ha Kyung.

134
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:32,550
(Jo Il Kwon)

135
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:34,850
You need to feel more desperate.

136
00:08:38,819 --> 00:08:42,295
Goodness, after you became
a prominent actress overseas,

137
00:08:42,319 --> 00:08:44,689
everyone is dying to see you.

138
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,235
- Goodness, hello.
- Hello.

139
00:08:47,259 --> 00:08:48,875
It's so nice to see you, Ha Jin.

140
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:50,005
Hello.

141
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,675
I finally get to meet you.

142
00:08:51,699 --> 00:08:54,439
Do you know
how long we waited to see you?

143
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,216
The director is in the meeting room.

144
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,439
You two can have
a great conversation.

145
00:08:58,810 --> 00:08:59,810
Okay.

146
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:01,439
- I'll be back.
- Go ahead.

147
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,326
I heard her scenes...

148
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:09,995
in "Kill the Venus 2"
increased by double.

149
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:11,750
It's not exactly double, per se.

150
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:17,935
Actually, Ha Jin only signed
the contract for the first movie,

151
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:20,776
but after the movie premiered,

152
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,076
the director went out of his way to
persuade her to do the second one.

153
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,470
Ha Jin will end up
becoming a huge world star.

154
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:33,016
- That's her class right now, right?
- Yes.

155
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,915
She once went to
a famous brunch place,

156
00:09:35,939 --> 00:09:37,526
and Justin Bieber...

157
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,949
Wait, that Justin Bieber?

158
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:42,055
Yes, he recognized her and said hi.

159
00:09:42,079 --> 00:09:43,120
Oh, my.

160
00:09:43,319 --> 00:09:46,420
I think they're still in touch.

161
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:49,805
He only said hi,

162
00:09:49,829 --> 00:09:51,990
thinking we were his fans
since we were staring at him.

163
00:09:53,129 --> 00:09:54,336
Do you like him?

164
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,500
Of course.

165
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,706
I'm sorry about last time.

166
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:00,245
You came all the way
to the filming site...

167
00:10:00,269 --> 00:10:01,639
but couldn't see me.

168
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,610
It seems like my trip
to the States paid off.

169
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:08,879
Aren't you back in Korea
because you felt bad?

170
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,009
You're right.

171
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:16,049
Did you read the revised scenario?

172
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,850
Yes. I read it.

173
00:10:18,549 --> 00:10:20,895
I had more lines than before,

174
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:23,559
but the male lead
seemed less interesting.

175
00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:26,360
I liked your original one better.

176
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:28,330
I see.

177
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:31,775
Speaking of, I'd like to ask you
a question.

178
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:32,899
What is it?

179
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:35,416
You do know that
I was involved in a scandal...

180
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,340
before leaving for
the States, right?

181
00:10:38,909 --> 00:10:42,279
They could bring it up again.
Will you be okay with that?

182
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:44,909
Oh, that?

183
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,926
If you think you may back out,

184
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,179
please let me know right now.

185
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,690
I've gone through such incidents
quite often.

186
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:55,590
It's best not to waste
each other's time.

187
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,230
Do you remember...

188
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:03,570
when I told you that I had written
this scenario with you in mind?

189
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,929
That was long before...

190
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:10,210
you had left for the States.

191
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:14,210
Even after what happened,

192
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:17,809
I never thought twice...

193
00:11:18,649 --> 00:11:20,679
about casting you.

194
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:24,649
What do you say?
Was that a good enough answer?

195
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,389
Yes, it was.

196
00:11:30,659 --> 00:11:31,830
I'm exhausted.

197
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:36,299
Why am I so tired?

198
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,830
That's because
you've been bluffing all day.

199
00:11:38,929 --> 00:11:41,316
Your English hasn't improved,
but your bluffing has.

200
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,546
I wasn't bluffing.

201
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:45,716
I just slightly sugarcoated
the facts.

202
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,216
You should've heard her.

203
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,255
She was bluffing so much
in front of the CEO.

204
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:51,379
Really?

205
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:54,155
How was the talk with the director?

206
00:11:54,179 --> 00:11:55,679
It went great.

207
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:59,220
He's so nice, and the scenario
is exactly what I expected.

208
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:02,035
It's soft but has a decisive topic.

209
00:12:02,059 --> 00:12:04,330
Did you tell him
you'd think about it?

210
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:06,029
Yes, he said that was fine.

211
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:09,360
So what do you want to do?

212
00:12:11,029 --> 00:12:12,470
I'm not sure yet.

213
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:15,576
I'm greatly interested in the movie,

214
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,080
but there are many things
to consider.

215
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:18,909
What do you think?

216
00:12:19,409 --> 00:12:20,556
To be honest, it hasn't been
that long...

217
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,755
since you've succeeded
in the States.

218
00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:25,350
Perhaps, it's too early
to come back.

219
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:28,755
If you're not planning to work
in Korea again, then it's fine.

220
00:12:28,779 --> 00:12:30,326
But if not,

221
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:33,166
I think this is your opportunity.

222
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:35,466
We'll support you no matter what,

223
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:37,259
so take your time.

224
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:39,365
She's right.
You've been working relentlessly.

225
00:12:39,389 --> 00:12:41,559
You should take some good rest
and think about it.

226
00:12:42,299 --> 00:12:43,799
Okay. I'll do that.

227
00:12:55,879 --> 00:12:56,879
Thanks.

228
00:13:00,549 --> 00:13:01,726
I asked Anchor Lee to add
more comments...

229
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,720
since we had too much free time.

230
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:04,797
He's not here yet, is he?

231
00:13:04,821 --> 00:13:06,865
No, I think he's getting ready.

232
00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:08,535
Ask him how long it'll take.

233
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:09,590
Yes, sir.

234
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:11,690
Hold on.

235
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:14,429
Tell him that I'm not rushing him.

236
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:19,669
Do explain that
I'm just simply anxious.

237
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:20,799
Okay.

238
00:13:23,139 --> 00:13:24,745
Did you just smirk?

239
00:13:24,769 --> 00:13:28,385
It seems like you're walking
on eggshells around him.

240
00:13:28,409 --> 00:13:30,179
Of course, I should.

241
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:33,149
He's the face of our news channel.

242
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:51,629
Is the team manager
asking for the revised manuscript?

243
00:13:51,769 --> 00:13:54,899
He wanted you to know
that he's not rushing you.

244
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:01,716
Here. Can you print me a copy
as well?

245
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:02,840
Okay.

246
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:05,850
Hi.

247
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,580
Yes, this is it.

248
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:12,990
I feel so much at peace.

249
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,796
Are you going to come here...

250
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,365
every time I'm preparing
for the news?

251
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:19,905
I want to enjoy this happiness
for the next month.

252
00:14:19,929 --> 00:14:23,370
Is everything fine?
Do you want a softer chair?

253
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:26,769
Do you want anything to drink?
How about that honey drink?

254
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,645
I'm fine, so you may leave.

255
00:14:28,669 --> 00:14:30,169
All right, I got it.

256
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,285
You're not worried
about the interview, are you?

257
00:14:32,309 --> 00:14:34,080
This is your first interview
after returning.

258
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:37,850
I'm not sure. You've invited
a very special guest.

259
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:41,679
I think I saw him in the green room.
You should visit him.

260
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:45,365
That's okay.
He'll feel uncomfortable.

261
00:14:45,389 --> 00:14:46,629
It's better that we don't meet.

262
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:49,929
Hasn't it been ages
since you've last met?

263
00:14:50,029 --> 00:14:51,029
You're right.

264
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:53,029
It's been two years.

265
00:14:54,029 --> 00:14:58,206
3, 2, 1.

266
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,570
Anchor!

267
00:15:00,269 --> 00:15:02,745
Many people have been interested
and supportive of him...

268
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:05,370
for what he's been doing abroad.

269
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:07,940
He's with us today as a guest.

270
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,226
It's nice to meet you,
Doctor Yoo Tae Eun.

271
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,596
Hello.

272
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,580
I'm Doctor Yoo Tae Eun,
a psychiatrist.

273
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,936
You've been counseling those
who have received trauma...

274
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,066
due to violence in countries...

275
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,659
that are at war for free.

276
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:29,399
How long has it been
since you were last in Korea?

277
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:33,046
Due to the environment I was in,

278
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:35,169
time flew by so quickly.

279
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,385
But when I checked my passport
this time,

280
00:15:37,409 --> 00:15:38,970
I realized that
it had been two years.

281
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:42,240
That's not a short amount of time.

282
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:44,385
What do you think?
Have things changed around here?

283
00:15:44,409 --> 00:15:46,950
At first, I thought so.

284
00:15:47,419 --> 00:15:48,796
But after some time,

285
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,250
I could spot the things
that hadn't changed.

286
00:15:51,419 --> 00:15:54,120
For example, you're still
the news anchor.

287
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:56,559
You're right.

288
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,929
I heard you came back
for a reason.

289
00:15:59,429 --> 00:16:00,836
You're holding an exhibition?

290
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,206
Yes, I'm displaying the drawings
made by the children...

291
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:06,629
I had counseled
during drawing therapy.

292
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:10,216
The profit will be used
to educate children...

293
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,940
in countries that are at war.

294
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:17,049
Since he's such a righteous doctor,
Jeong Hoon won't criticize him.

295
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,480
So what if he does?

296
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:23,966
No matter what he does,
you love him so much.

297
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:26,765
Most of them
are victims of violence.

298
00:16:26,789 --> 00:16:28,735
- Is it that obvious?
- Extremely.

299
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:31,460
Because of that,
they become traumatized.

300
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,500
Why are you
in such a hurry to leave?

301
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:40,316
I'm meeting a reporter
early tomorrow morning...

302
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,645
regarding the exhibition.

303
00:16:41,669 --> 00:16:44,645
It's too late for you to treat me
to something nice anyway.

304
00:16:44,669 --> 00:16:45,769
You can treat me next time.

305
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:47,885
You seem to be busier here.

306
00:16:47,909 --> 00:16:51,355
Then you shouldn't have invited me
as a guest.

307
00:16:51,379 --> 00:16:53,850
Just now, I received two calls.

308
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,649
I think I'm born to appear on TV.

309
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:01,059
Aren't charity events supposed
to make you humbler?

310
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:03,296
You've changed.

311
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:06,035
It's only natural.
It's been two years.

312
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:08,600
It's actually strange
that you haven't.

313
00:17:09,159 --> 00:17:10,230
Really?

314
00:17:11,769 --> 00:17:13,129
Goodness.

315
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,169
Are you still waiting for her?

316
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:18,710
Ha Jin.

317
00:17:20,409 --> 00:17:22,179
Why don't you just call her first?

318
00:17:23,879 --> 00:17:25,625
Actually, I saw her yesterday.

319
00:17:25,649 --> 00:17:27,379
You did? Where?

320
00:17:27,649 --> 00:17:30,265
It was a coincidence.
I saw her while driving.

321
00:17:30,289 --> 00:17:32,220
Then you should've stopped her.

322
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,559
Should I have?

323
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:40,299
If it's fate, then we'll meet again.

324
00:17:41,399 --> 00:17:44,029
Gosh, you're so pitiful.

325
00:17:44,429 --> 00:17:46,775
I'll clear my schedule
for this weekend, so call me.

326
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,039
I'll treat you to a meal.

327
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,940
- Okay.
- Bye.

328
00:17:51,139 --> 00:17:53,039
- I'll call you.
- Sure.

329
00:17:57,649 --> 00:18:00,125
Many people have been interested
and supportive of him...

330
00:18:00,149 --> 00:18:03,019
for what he's been doing abroad.

331
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:05,389
He's with us today as a guest.

332
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,765
- What are you doing?
- It's nice to meet you...

333
00:18:07,789 --> 00:18:09,096
- Hey.
- Hello.

334
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,429
I'm so sleepy. I'm going to bed.

335
00:18:11,929 --> 00:18:13,230
You were awake until I came in.

336
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,029
I'm going to bed now.

337
00:18:15,659 --> 00:18:17,970
What's that sound? What is it?

338
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:19,570
Let me see.

339
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,139
Move.

340
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,440
- Move.
- It's nothing.

341
00:18:23,539 --> 00:18:24,909
Move!

342
00:18:26,809 --> 00:18:28,809
You were watching the news.

343
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:32,825
Yes. Doctor Yoo was on the news.

344
00:18:32,849 --> 00:18:35,150
Is that so?
But that's Anchor Lee.

345
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,065
You're right.

346
00:18:37,089 --> 00:18:39,265
I'm not sleepy.
You're not either, right?

347
00:18:39,289 --> 00:18:41,636
Judging by what you're doing,
I think I'm right.

348
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,589
You are. That's why
I was watching Doctor Yoo.

349
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:46,829
I'm going out for a bit. Wait here.

350
00:18:47,029 --> 00:18:48,160
Where are you going?

351
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:50,575
Answer me.

352
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:52,130
Just keep watching.

353
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,339
Let's talk about charity.

354
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:03,710
You're counseling those
in countries that are at war.

355
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:05,910
This is something new.

356
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,319
What is all this?

357
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:13,765
Let's have a drink.

358
00:19:13,789 --> 00:19:14,890
We're having wine?

359
00:19:15,859 --> 00:19:17,866
- Tada.
- It's makgeolli.

360
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,866
This is a cure for insomnia.

361
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:21,835
Gosh, it's been ages.

362
00:19:21,859 --> 00:19:24,406
There's makgeolli, kimchi pancakes,
and cartilage.

363
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:25,769
Eat as much as you want.

364
00:19:26,269 --> 00:19:28,539
What's gotten into you?

365
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,470
You're free tomorrow.
You'll be running.

366
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,839
I should've known better.

367
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,009
Fine, then.

368
00:19:35,539 --> 00:19:36,950
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

369
00:19:44,019 --> 00:19:45,490
This is so good.

370
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:48,789
It hits the spot.
It's the taste of Korea.

371
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:51,160
It's so good!

372
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:01,376
Staying with you at home
feels surreal.

373
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,470
Why is that surreal?

374
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,886
When we were in the States,

375
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:07,410
my time in Korea seemed
like a dream,

376
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:10,980
but now that I'm in Korea, my time
in the States feels like a dream.

377
00:20:14,349 --> 00:20:16,220
It's been a long time
I've been away,

378
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:20,150
but it feels like I'm circling
around the same spot.

379
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:23,859
Is it because of Anchor Lee?

380
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:27,630
Why you can't decide on this movie
and are still thinking about it?

381
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,569
It's not just about him.

382
00:20:34,369 --> 00:20:35,700
I'm just scared.

383
00:20:37,539 --> 00:20:40,339
And I'm not sure if it's okay
for me to come back to Korea.

384
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:43,039
Forget about other reasons.

385
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:46,349
If you still like him
after all this time has passed,

386
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:48,139
you should just get back with him.

387
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:51,819
Don't regret it.

388
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,217
- Yes, Ha Kyung.
- Where are you?

389
00:21:14,241 --> 00:21:15,680
I came out to shop.

390
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:17,250
To shop?

391
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,856
Jamie is hooked on Korean
historical drama these days,

392
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,956
so Jamie told me to bring back
some traditional fans.

393
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,495
Then, you should have asked me
to go with you.

394
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:27,136
What if people recognize you
when you're all by yourself?

395
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,265
But no one knows
that I'm in Korea.

396
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:31,305
And if I cover up my face,
I'll look more suspicious.

397
00:21:31,329 --> 00:21:33,130
But still.
You should have put on a hat.

398
00:21:33,589 --> 00:21:34,835
Gosh, okay.

399
00:21:34,859 --> 00:21:37,299
If something happens,
call me right away. I'll be there.

400
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,670
Don't worry.
I'll call you on my way home.

401
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,200
Okay.

402
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:46,910
My gosh, where can I get the fans?

403
00:21:54,349 --> 00:21:55,349
I'm hungry.

404
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,250
What should we eat?

405
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:58,819
Hold on. Wait.

406
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:01,359
Aren't you Ms. Yeo Ha Jin?

407
00:22:02,289 --> 00:22:03,420
No.

408
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:06,106
Do I look like her?
I get that quite often.

409
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:08,660
Yes. You totally look like her.
Right?

410
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,299
You're really not her?

411
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:12,670
She's in the States right now.

412
00:22:12,769 --> 00:22:13,845
Right.

413
00:22:13,869 --> 00:22:16,075
But thank you for telling me
that I look like a pretty actress.

414
00:22:16,099 --> 00:22:17,716
She's an awesome actress.

415
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,470
- I see. Right.
- Yes.

416
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:21,609
- I'm sorry about that.
- Bye.

417
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,216
- She looks nothing like Ha Jin.
- Isn't that her?

418
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,579
Come here. Let's go.

419
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,079
Ha Jin.

420
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:43,619
How are you here?

421
00:23:47,089 --> 00:23:48,099
Well,

422
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:50,670
I needed to buy something.

423
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:58,839
Have you been well?

424
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,509
Yes. I have been well.

425
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,579
What about you, Anchor Lee?

426
00:24:11,589 --> 00:24:13,750
Did you come back to Korea for good?

427
00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:17,660
No.

428
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:20,089
I need to go back to the States.

429
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:23,230
I see.

430
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:27,200
Isn't that Yeo Ha Jin?

431
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,700
- She is. Let's take a photo.
- I can't believe it.

432
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,769
I'll get going.

433
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:01,206
The number you have dialed
has been suspended...

434
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:04,230
for the time being as requested.

435
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:08,000
The number you have dialed
has been suspended...

436
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,476
I'm sorry.

437
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,005
I was in a hurry.

438
00:26:40,029 --> 00:26:42,176
It's all right.
I can call my insurance company.

439
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,440
- Are you hurt?
- No, I am okay.

440
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:47,656
To cover all four corners, why don't
we pull over and discuss this?

441
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,156
I have a customer inside.

442
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,926
I might have to let
my customer go first.

443
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:52,279
- Okay, let's do that.
- Okay.

444
00:26:55,079 --> 00:26:56,180
Are you okay?

445
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,029
Anchor Lee.

446
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,269
We meet again.

447
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:27,420
Are you hurt?

448
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,380
No, I'm okay.

449
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:32,626
What about you?

450
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:34,019
I'm okay too.

451
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:36,966
Out of all taxis,

452
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:38,750
I was in an accident
with a taxi you were in.

453
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:41,529
Right.

454
00:27:42,059 --> 00:27:43,930
So that's our destiny.

455
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:46,930
We're destined to fall in love.

456
00:27:49,099 --> 00:27:52,210
They run into each other three times
on the same day in the same place,

457
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:55,410
then they miss each other by a hair.

458
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:59,710
Then they get into
a ridiculous accident on a street.

459
00:28:01,349 --> 00:28:03,295
Don't you think there are
way too many coincidences?

460
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:05,150
That's why they're meant to be.

461
00:28:06,049 --> 00:28:08,490
They're destined to meet each other
and fall in love.

462
00:28:14,329 --> 00:28:17,259
The way we met tells us
we're destined to be together.

463
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:18,970
Isn't that right?

464
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:27,240
Where were you going?
Let me drop you off.

465
00:28:28,309 --> 00:28:30,509
I think it will be harder
for you to run away now.

466
00:28:41,089 --> 00:28:42,396
We got here too fast.

467
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,260
I took my time on purpose
to get to your place.

468
00:29:01,509 --> 00:29:03,339
Thank you for the ride.

469
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,410
I didn't know you were staying here.

470
00:29:06,049 --> 00:29:08,489
Someone else was living here,
so I thought you sold the place.

471
00:29:08,819 --> 00:29:11,450
Ms. Park's niece and her husband
have been staying here.

472
00:29:11,849 --> 00:29:13,990
But they let me have the place
for the time being.

473
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:15,390
I see.

474
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,029
You're sure
that you're not hurt, right?

475
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,700
If you're hurt, please call me.

476
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:23,759
I still have the same number.

477
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,740
I will.

478
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:35,410
I'll go in now. Bye.

479
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:37,710
Wait.

480
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:45,650
I wanted to tell you something,
but I couldn't.

481
00:29:50,259 --> 00:29:51,660
You asked...

482
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:54,029
if I have been well.

483
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:59,000
I tried my best,

484
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,670
but I couldn't do that.

485
00:30:04,509 --> 00:30:06,609
I missed you
and wanted to see you too much.

486
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,509
On the last day I saw you,

487
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:18,049
even if you turn me down many times,
I shouldn't have broken up with you.

488
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:22,130
I should've begged you and said
we have to overcome this together...

489
00:30:23,059 --> 00:30:24,759
to be happy.

490
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,829
I regretted everything
from the moment you left.

491
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:35,039
I regretted it too.

492
00:30:38,869 --> 00:30:41,109
I'm so sorry that I left you here...

493
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:44,950
all alone.

494
00:31:43,909 --> 00:31:46,485
(Final Episode)

495
00:31:46,509 --> 00:31:48,879
I saw it! I saw it!
I saw everything!

496
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,386
See what?

497
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:53,279
I saw you and Anchor Lee
in each other's arms!

498
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,919
What's going on?
Are you two an item again?

499
00:31:56,019 --> 00:31:58,320
- Yes.
- I'm so glad.

500
00:31:58,419 --> 00:31:59,666
Don't ever break up with him again.

501
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:01,210
You've done well,
so you can have this.

502
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:04,160
I'm never going to
break up with him.

503
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:06,776
You need to step it up, though.
Try not to break up with him.

504
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,500
Your relationship might end first.

505
00:32:27,619 --> 00:32:28,750
I have something to say.

506
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:30,450
I need to see you after work.

507
00:32:30,689 --> 00:32:31,920
I'll be at your office.

508
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:47,146
This was such a great opportunity
to talk to you face to face,

509
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:48,769
not through a video call,

510
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,786
but we lost days...

511
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:52,170
because of my stupidity.

512
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:55,780
It's okay. I can see why
you misunderstood that.

513
00:32:57,379 --> 00:32:59,849
But I'm so glad
I can talk to you like this.

514
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:02,450
Let's grab a seat.

515
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:11,829
Things were really tough for me
while I was in the US.

516
00:33:12,189 --> 00:33:14,275
I wanted to see you, but I couldn't,

517
00:33:14,299 --> 00:33:16,619
and it was difficult to reach you
with the time difference.

518
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:18,275
Really?

519
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:20,476
We had been apart for too long,

520
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,739
so the anxiety
began to make me feel troubled.

521
00:33:23,939 --> 00:33:26,480
To be honest,
you're popular at the TV station.

522
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,656
You don't have to worry about
something like that.

523
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,109
You're the only one for me.

524
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:33,819
I understand why you got angry too.

525
00:33:34,219 --> 00:33:36,049
You must feel nervous as well.

526
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,290
You're right about that.

527
00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:40,859
I gave this a thought.

528
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:45,260
I don't know
when I'll be back from the US,

529
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:47,906
and you don't seem to get chosen
as a correspondent.

530
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:50,200
Wait, what are you talking about?

531
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:52,770
You aren't asking me
to break up with you, are you?

532
00:33:56,009 --> 00:33:57,939
We can't keep dating like this.

533
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:59,310
Ha Kyung.

534
00:34:00,409 --> 00:34:01,409
Here.

535
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:04,909
(Let's live together.)

536
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:08,959
Only death awaits you
if you turn me down.

537
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:12,189
Of course, I'll say yes.

538
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:15,360
Thank you.
Let's live together forever.

539
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:17,810
I'll kill you
if your feelings change.

540
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,205
Should we move in together
starting today?

541
00:34:19,229 --> 00:34:20,306
I can't do that today.

542
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:21,806
Why not? Then tomorrow?

543
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:24,199
- No.
- Why not? Then when?

544
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:26,316
No idea.

545
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:27,500
So when?

546
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,240
Ji Won.

547
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:34,939
Tae Eun.

548
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:36,686
Why are you out here?

549
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:39,186
My mom kept telling me
to go out and check.

550
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:42,650
Goodness, she gets worried
way too easily.

551
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:46,819
Hey, you're here.

552
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:48,759
Was there a lot of traffic?

553
00:34:48,919 --> 00:34:51,590
No, I left early,
so it was all right.

554
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:53,976
I didn't think
Father would be here too.

555
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,699
I thought you two
wouldn't want to meet...

556
00:34:55,759 --> 00:34:58,006
unless I set you up like this.

557
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:59,030
Sit down.

558
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:00,740
Honey, what are you doing?

559
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:03,286
Tae Eun is here. Say hi to him.

560
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:05,710
It's not like
he did anything special.

561
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,240
Take a seat.

562
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:09,316
Mother, take a seat.
Ji Won, you too.

563
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,349
Okay.

564
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,596
Mother, how are you doing?

565
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:17,496
I heard you pulled your back
trying to carry something heavy.

566
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,765
I've gotten much better
after I went to the hospital.

567
00:35:19,789 --> 00:35:20,936
I'm fine now.

568
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,560
But still, be careful.

569
00:35:22,689 --> 00:35:24,235
Don't carry anything too heavy.

570
00:35:24,259 --> 00:35:25,735
Make Ji Won do it.

571
00:35:25,759 --> 00:35:27,560
I help her out a lot.

572
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,900
All right.

573
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:33,515
But you look much better now
than the last time...

574
00:35:33,539 --> 00:35:35,145
you sent me a picture.

575
00:35:35,169 --> 00:35:36,515
- Really?
- Yes.

576
00:35:36,539 --> 00:35:38,316
I think I gained a bit of weight...

577
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,915
thanks to the side dishes
you sent me.

578
00:35:39,939 --> 00:35:43,656
Her side dishes aren't that good.

579
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,156
That's an overstatement.

580
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:47,156
No way, it was really good.

581
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:49,626
Fine, I guess that can happen...

582
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:51,066
if you live abroad for too long.

583
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:52,165
Goodness, you.

584
00:35:52,189 --> 00:35:53,389
Ouch.

585
00:35:56,229 --> 00:35:58,389
Have you been well, Father?

586
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:01,060
Mother told me about you
from time to time.

587
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:04,375
Let's order first.

588
00:36:04,399 --> 00:36:06,276
It seemed like
they've been waiting for us.

589
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,740
Right, okay.

590
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:09,346
- Okay, let's do that.
- Let's see.

591
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:11,410
- What should we eat?
- The most expensive dish.

592
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,516
- This looks good.
- You can choose something.

593
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:15,100
- That looks good too.
- This one and...

594
00:36:24,589 --> 00:36:25,589
Father.

595
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:30,136
You could've called me in instead of
coming out if you're done.

596
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,206
Let's go back in.

597
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,829
Do you still blame me?

598
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,870
I heard you quit
your teaching job...

599
00:36:38,199 --> 00:36:41,569
and only stayed in your study
after that happened.

600
00:36:42,069 --> 00:36:44,069
Mother had been
really worried about you.

601
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:46,209
I feel sorry in a certain aspect,

602
00:36:46,939 --> 00:36:48,110
but I don't regret it.

603
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,509
I did it for your sake too.

604
00:36:51,009 --> 00:36:52,485
Let's not talk about that.

605
00:36:52,509 --> 00:36:54,279
It's all in the past anyway.

606
00:36:56,649 --> 00:36:58,920
So are you doing this
to protest against me?

607
00:36:59,019 --> 00:37:00,596
- Pardon?
- Why don't you...

608
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:02,519
come home?
Why do you keep traveling around?

609
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,589
Is it because of me?

610
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:08,459
It's not like that.
I really enjoy doing this.

611
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,105
And it's rewarding to be there...

612
00:37:11,129 --> 00:37:13,100
to help the people that are in need.

613
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,545
I really feel alive.

614
00:37:14,569 --> 00:37:18,310
Goodness, I worked hard
to turn you into a doctor,

615
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:20,615
but you feel rewarded
by doing something that petty?

616
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:22,980
I feel much happier now
than when I ran my clinic.

617
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:26,226
But of course,
I'm sure you won't like it.

618
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:29,019
You'll have to live
doing what you're destined to do.

619
00:37:29,819 --> 00:37:31,659
Anyway, don't go anywhere
that's too dangerous.

620
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:34,060
Let's go inside.

621
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:38,730
Father.

622
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:40,636
You should come and see
the exhibition with Mother.

623
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:42,536
I'll keep some tickets for you.

624
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,629
Maybe.

625
00:37:49,709 --> 00:37:52,610
("News Live": Jo Il Kwon)

626
00:37:57,279 --> 00:37:59,125
Jeong Hoon, don't you think
you're way too inconsiderate?

627
00:37:59,149 --> 00:38:00,896
Why are you saying that to me
as soon as I walk in?

628
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,850
I heard you're dating Ha Jin again.

629
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:05,726
Do I have to report
something like that to you?

630
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:09,459
Ha Kyung will find out
everything you've been doing.

631
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:14,000
Come on.
You don't have to go that far.

632
00:38:14,199 --> 00:38:16,305
I'll give you my full support...

633
00:38:16,329 --> 00:38:19,370
for your relationship
to come to fruition.

634
00:38:19,399 --> 00:38:21,470
I'll manage my own relationship.

635
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:23,339
Just focus on Ha Kyung.

636
00:38:23,439 --> 00:38:24,709
Go work.

637
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,115
You better brace yourself.

638
00:38:29,139 --> 00:38:32,110
A long-distance relationship
isn't as easy as you think.

639
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,855
You should go on as many dates
as possible before she leaves.

640
00:38:35,879 --> 00:38:37,350
Isn't she leaving next Monday?

641
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:56,076
I'm sorry. I had to finish
watching the news.

642
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,269
That's okay.

643
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:59,879
Is there anything you'd like to do?

644
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,910
Or anywhere you'd like to go?

645
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:08,050
I do, but it's too late today.

646
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:09,480
Really?

647
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,620
I shouldn't have said yes
to returning to the news.

648
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:15,836
I have no time to waste
if we're going to make up...

649
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,389
for all the lost dates.

650
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:20,600
When will you be coming back?

651
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:23,206
I think it'll take a month.

652
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:25,110
There are several things
I need to take care of.

653
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:28,339
That's fine. I even waited for you
for two years.

654
00:39:29,569 --> 00:39:31,910
Promise me we'll go on many dates
before you leave.

655
00:39:32,709 --> 00:39:35,379
I do. Let's go.

656
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,889
What are you thinking about?

657
00:39:46,389 --> 00:39:48,459
"People will start talking again."

658
00:39:49,589 --> 00:39:53,605
"Some people
may still criticize us."

659
00:39:53,629 --> 00:39:54,860
Things like these.

660
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:58,329
They haven't forgotten about it.

661
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:00,069
I don't think they ever will.

662
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,769
Are you afraid?

663
00:40:03,069 --> 00:40:04,069
No.

664
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:06,910
What I feared the most...

665
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,509
was not being able
to hold your hand anymore.

666
00:40:12,579 --> 00:40:13,620
The same goes for me.

667
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:17,820
That's why I have nothing to fear.

668
00:40:18,789 --> 00:40:20,360
As long as you're okay.

669
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:24,789
I've always been okay.

670
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:26,960
As long as you were.

671
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,360
Then we're good.

672
00:40:30,769 --> 00:40:33,440
I finally know my top priority.

673
00:40:34,799 --> 00:40:35,899
Is that me?

674
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:37,639
It's us.

675
00:40:39,139 --> 00:40:40,840
- Us?
- Yes.

676
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:52,720
Aren't you exhausted?

677
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:55,120
Not one bit.

678
00:40:56,019 --> 00:40:58,579
I'm going to listen to your voice
a bit more before going to bed.

679
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:03,399
Oh, right. I have a dilemma.

680
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:04,529
What is it?

681
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:07,299
I have to make
an important decision.

682
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:09,816
I need to choose...

683
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,710
between a Korean movie
and "Kill the Venus 3".

684
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:14,485
They're both great opportunities,

685
00:41:14,509 --> 00:41:16,480
so I'm in a big dilemma.

686
00:41:18,149 --> 00:41:20,379
Which one do you think
I should take?

687
00:41:21,649 --> 00:41:22,720
I'm not sure.

688
00:41:23,289 --> 00:41:25,826
If I were to be selfish,
I'd like you to stay here...

689
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:27,419
instead of going back.

690
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:30,090
But that's wrong.

691
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:34,659
If that's what you want,
then I'll do that.

692
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:40,899
You see, I don't know much
about movies.

693
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:44,409
Give me some time,
and I'll think about it.

694
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:46,370
Sure.

695
00:41:47,639 --> 00:41:50,809
(Yang Jin Woo)

696
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:00,780
("Director Yang Knows How to Make
Blockbuster, Cinematic Movies")

697
00:42:12,299 --> 00:42:15,200
Of all the things you've made,
this coffee takes the cake.

698
00:42:15,299 --> 00:42:16,710
I'm going to crave this every day.

699
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:18,639
Just let me know.

700
00:42:19,539 --> 00:42:22,009
I'll buy it for you anytime.
I have a lot of money.

701
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:26,279
You picked the right one.

702
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:31,049
Oh, right.
Have you thought about it?

703
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:34,759
I'm terribly torn between the two.

704
00:42:36,019 --> 00:42:37,230
I've looked into it.

705
00:42:38,529 --> 00:42:41,235
Director Yang's movies...

706
00:42:41,259 --> 00:42:43,769
were generally liked
by the audience.

707
00:42:44,429 --> 00:42:46,970
Many of them complimented
his characters.

708
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,775
They especially complimented...

709
00:42:48,799 --> 00:42:51,139
on how charming
the female leads are.

710
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:53,409
As for "Kill the Venus",

711
00:42:53,809 --> 00:42:56,985
it's true that it's a blockbuster.

712
00:42:57,009 --> 00:43:00,779
It'll help you become
more globally famous.

713
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:01,919
Hold on.

714
00:43:02,419 --> 00:43:05,350
You actually looked into all this?

715
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:07,059
Yes, during my spare time.

716
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:10,529
You said it was important.
I had to be thorough.

717
00:43:11,559 --> 00:43:13,836
I didn't want to think about it.

718
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:16,706
I asked you, hoping that...

719
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:20,100
you'd tell me to just stay here.

720
00:43:21,169 --> 00:43:23,610
I feel bad that you put
so much effort into this.

721
00:43:24,139 --> 00:43:26,610
Of course, I'd want that.

722
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,909
But you like your job.

723
00:43:30,549 --> 00:43:32,009
You feel happy when acting.

724
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:35,450
So don't put me first.

725
00:43:35,850 --> 00:43:37,649
Think about what's best for you.

726
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:41,960
Have I told you before...

727
00:43:43,529 --> 00:43:45,990
that I extremely love you?

728
00:43:48,929 --> 00:43:49,970
I love you even more.

729
00:44:04,379 --> 00:44:05,485
I don't want to.

730
00:44:05,509 --> 00:44:07,179
Why not? You look too...

731
00:44:07,879 --> 00:44:09,855
- You look too boring.
- It's suffocating.

732
00:44:09,879 --> 00:44:11,395
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Whatever.

733
00:44:11,419 --> 00:44:14,019
Hold on. You really don't listen.
Come here.

734
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:16,460
Stand there.

735
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:21,275
Why are you going this far?
Let me dress like how I always do.

736
00:44:21,299 --> 00:44:23,576
Still, this is your first day...

737
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,700
as the team manager
for the 9 p.m. news.

738
00:44:26,029 --> 00:44:27,899
You should look like one.

739
00:44:30,669 --> 00:44:33,755
Should we eat something tasty
after work?

740
00:44:33,779 --> 00:44:35,179
This isn't a big deal.

741
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:36,779
I want beef.

742
00:44:39,509 --> 00:44:41,255
All right.

743
00:44:41,279 --> 00:44:43,326
You're now
a part of the 9 p.m. news.

744
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:44,426
Buying beef is nothing.

745
00:44:44,450 --> 00:44:45,566
- But we're going dutch.
- No, thanks.

746
00:44:45,590 --> 00:44:47,620
Come on, now.

747
00:44:48,259 --> 00:44:53,360
By the way, you really look nice.

748
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:55,105
Really? Do I look okay?

749
00:44:55,129 --> 00:44:57,799
Yes. You look so handsome.

750
00:45:00,269 --> 00:45:03,076
Hey, are you crazy? Hurry up.
You're late for the meeting.

751
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:04,110
Yes, ma'am.

752
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,450
Are you sure you're free right now?

753
00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:13,855
I am. I already did all the work
in advance...

754
00:45:13,879 --> 00:45:15,149
so I could be with you.

755
00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:18,289
It's been a long time
since I've come here.

756
00:45:19,090 --> 00:45:22,190
Don't we have so many memories
of this place?

757
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:27,360
Are you free for lunch tomorrow?

758
00:45:27,759 --> 00:45:29,330
Yes.

759
00:45:29,899 --> 00:45:31,870
Why? Are we going somewhere nice?

760
00:45:32,870 --> 00:45:34,039
It's not that.

761
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:37,210
There's someone who really wants
to meet you.

762
00:45:38,009 --> 00:45:39,139
Who is it?

763
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:42,740
What? Look who's here.

764
00:45:44,909 --> 00:45:47,696
Ha Jin, it's been a long time.

765
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:48,895
Hello.

766
00:45:48,919 --> 00:45:52,320
Have you heard? I'm the team manager
of the 9 p.m. news.

767
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:55,166
Really? Congratulations.
That's a promotion, right?

768
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:57,605
Yes, it is.

769
00:45:57,629 --> 00:46:01,306
You and I have climbed up the ladder
in the past couple of years.

770
00:46:01,330 --> 00:46:03,105
You're a world-class star,

771
00:46:03,129 --> 00:46:04,946
and I'm the team manager
of the main news.

772
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:06,810
Jeong Hoon's the only one
who's still the same.

773
00:46:07,070 --> 00:46:08,100
You're right.

774
00:46:08,399 --> 00:46:11,669
By the way, would you be interested
in doing an interview?

775
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:12,746
For "News Live"?

776
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:15,956
No, for the 9 p.m. news.

777
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:18,226
"News Live" is no longer
what it used to be.

778
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:20,355
You can't be personal
when it comes to work, you know?

779
00:46:20,379 --> 00:46:22,456
You don't have to say yes
to all of his requests.

780
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,820
Choose what's best for you.

781
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:26,549
I will.

782
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,436
All right, then.
I hope to be hearing from you soon.

783
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:32,029
If you're done speaking,
we'll go now.

784
00:46:32,629 --> 00:46:33,936
We're running out of time.

785
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,200
Okay, okay.

786
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:37,570
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

787
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:43,269
They're making me jealous.

788
00:46:43,809 --> 00:46:45,440
Lucky them.

789
00:46:49,639 --> 00:46:51,909
Wait. How do I look?

790
00:46:52,879 --> 00:46:54,220
You look pretty.

791
00:46:55,049 --> 00:46:57,495
I'm more nervous right now
than when I auditioned for a movie.

792
00:46:57,519 --> 00:47:01,019
Don't be. I'm sure he'll like you.

793
00:47:01,419 --> 00:47:02,490
Let's go.

794
00:47:10,399 --> 00:47:12,500
You should stop staring
and start eating.

795
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:15,240
She may have an upset stomach
thanks to you.

796
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:16,909
All right.

797
00:47:18,509 --> 00:47:20,115
Enjoy the meal.

798
00:47:20,139 --> 00:47:21,639
You too.

799
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:34,659
Eat up.

800
00:47:34,990 --> 00:47:36,259
Thank you.

801
00:47:36,789 --> 00:47:39,659
Thank you for dating my son.

802
00:47:41,429 --> 00:47:43,629
You two look happy.

803
00:47:44,529 --> 00:47:45,769
It makes me happy as well.

804
00:48:02,049 --> 00:48:04,889
This one looks really nice.
It looks artistic.

805
00:48:05,519 --> 00:48:07,265
I'm going to hang this in my car
when I go back to the States.

806
00:48:07,289 --> 00:48:08,895
Didn't you say you'd do the same...

807
00:48:08,919 --> 00:48:10,999
with the photo you took
while having lunch yesterday?

808
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:14,076
Then I'll hang this in my bedroom.

809
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:15,375
That's what you said
about the one we took...

810
00:48:15,399 --> 00:48:17,629
three days ago at the observatory.

811
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:20,216
You should stop using
your excellent memory...

812
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,600
for teasing me.

813
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:23,840
You look cute when I tease you.

814
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:25,639
I plan to use my memory often.

815
00:48:25,970 --> 00:48:27,409
Just when you tease me?

816
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:30,009
Thank you.

817
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:32,909
For what?

818
00:48:33,350 --> 00:48:36,080
For suggesting
to visit my mother's grave first.

819
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,090
I asked you
because I wanted to pay her a visit.

820
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:41,395
And it didn't have anything
to do with you.

821
00:48:41,419 --> 00:48:43,296
She and I got along really well.

822
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,360
I think she thought the same...

823
00:48:46,429 --> 00:48:48,430
on the day when you met her.

824
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:52,630
I've never seen her smile like that.

825
00:48:54,539 --> 00:48:57,710
I'm thinking about visiting her
whenever I come back to Korea.

826
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:00,740
I can say hello to her
and go for a drive with you.

827
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,740
That will be nice.

828
00:49:03,509 --> 00:49:04,750
Sounds good to me too.

829
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,049
Then, let's take one more photo.

830
00:49:09,579 --> 00:49:11,349
In 1, 2, 3.

831
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:35,740
Yes, Ha Kyung.

832
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:37,579
I'm in front of my house.

833
00:49:38,279 --> 00:49:39,886
There are a lot of reporters.

834
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:41,755
Well, we saw this coming though.

835
00:49:41,779 --> 00:49:42,880
Don't worry.

836
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:45,150
Okay.

837
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:56,059
Are you ready?

838
00:49:56,599 --> 00:49:59,569
I just needed to rely on you
from the beginning.

839
00:49:59,799 --> 00:50:01,400
Aren't I really reliable?

840
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:04,416
Yes, I'm not scared at all...

841
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:06,170
now that I have you by my side.

842
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:08,039
I feel the same way.

843
00:50:13,009 --> 00:50:14,220
Shall we go in?

844
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:15,650
Yes.

845
00:50:25,059 --> 00:50:27,099
- There's Yeo Ha Jin.
- It's Lee Jeong Hoon.

846
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:30,946
Did you come back to Korea
because of Anchor Lee Jeong Hoon?

847
00:50:30,970 --> 00:50:32,805
- Why did you suddenly come back?
- What's your plan?

848
00:50:32,829 --> 00:50:35,646
- Why did you come back to Korea?
- Do you plan to get married?

849
00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:37,646
- What's your plan?
- Please answer our question.

850
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:40,656
- Did you get back together?
- Are you guys dating again?

851
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:43,555
- Do you love him?
- Anything for your fans?

852
00:50:43,579 --> 00:50:45,985
- Are you going to marry him?
- Anything for the press?

853
00:50:46,009 --> 00:50:49,480
- What's your plan?
- What does this mean?

854
00:50:52,390 --> 00:50:54,390
My gosh, who is it?
It's too early in the morning.

855
00:50:55,990 --> 00:50:57,029
That's for me!

856
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:01,230
That's for me! Mine! Don't touch it.

857
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:03,559
Don't touch it! It's mine!

858
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:09,569
(Hana Camping Mall)

859
00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:12,410
What's all this?

860
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:14,140
Are those clothes for Anchor Lee?

861
00:51:14,309 --> 00:51:16,279
No, camping gear.

862
00:51:17,650 --> 00:51:18,810
You can't stay out all night.

863
00:51:23,319 --> 00:51:24,366
Camping?

864
00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:26,265
Yes, I really wanted to go camping,

865
00:51:26,289 --> 00:51:28,160
but I've never gone camping before.

866
00:51:28,589 --> 00:51:30,706
Have you ever gone camping before?

867
00:51:30,730 --> 00:51:32,265
No, me neither.

868
00:51:32,289 --> 00:51:33,730
That's great.

869
00:51:34,029 --> 00:51:35,930
I bought everything we might need.

870
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:37,430
Already?

871
00:51:38,730 --> 00:51:41,200
You're going camping with me
this weekend, okay?

872
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:48,916
Here you go, Anchor Lee.

873
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:51,055
Okay. Is this everything we need?

874
00:51:51,079 --> 00:51:52,585
We loaded everything.

875
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:53,980
And this is my finishing touch.

876
00:51:55,549 --> 00:51:56,549
Do I look good?

877
00:51:56,779 --> 00:51:58,019
Perfect.

878
00:51:59,589 --> 00:52:01,319
- Let's get going.
- Let's go.

879
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,769
No way. Is it raining right now?

880
00:52:17,339 --> 00:52:19,309
I do see some raindrops drizzling.

881
00:52:22,839 --> 00:52:24,779
And now, it's pouring.

882
00:52:28,150 --> 00:52:29,920
Can we still go camping in the rain?

883
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:33,960
Yes. We can.

884
00:52:45,529 --> 00:52:47,245
How much longer?

885
00:52:47,269 --> 00:52:49,670
I'm hungry. Do you need some help?

886
00:52:50,069 --> 00:52:52,670
No, it's going well.
Go get some rest.

887
00:52:53,069 --> 00:52:55,686
You're sure it's going well, right?

888
00:52:55,710 --> 00:52:57,226
I'm following the recipe,

889
00:52:57,250 --> 00:52:58,890
but I can't guarantee
that it'll be tasty.

890
00:52:59,650 --> 00:53:03,119
All right. I just need
to put beer in it and cook it.

891
00:53:03,450 --> 00:53:05,619
What? Gosh.

892
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:06,966
What is it?

893
00:53:06,990 --> 00:53:09,660
I was supposed to marinate
the meat for three years.

894
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:11,789
It's okay.

895
00:53:12,089 --> 00:53:13,589
I don't mind eating bland food.

896
00:53:13,859 --> 00:53:14,859
Okay.

897
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:17,245
Then, I just need to cook it now.

898
00:53:17,269 --> 00:53:19,946
All right. I'm supposed
to cook this on a charcoal fire.

899
00:53:19,970 --> 00:53:21,315
I see. A charcoal fire.

900
00:53:21,339 --> 00:53:23,716
"When you don't have
a charcoal fire,"

901
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:26,170
"cook it on the stove for..." What?

902
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:29,779
- What is it now?
- It takes four hours to cook this.

903
00:53:31,779 --> 00:53:33,579
What should we do?
You must be starving.

904
00:53:34,049 --> 00:53:35,626
Do you want to cook ramyeon instead?

905
00:53:35,650 --> 00:53:37,196
Are you sure that will do?

906
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:39,049
I love ramyeon.

907
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:41,420
Ta-da.

908
00:53:53,299 --> 00:53:55,839
- Is it that good?
- It's so good!

909
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:57,069
Eat a lot.

910
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,940
No, I shouldn't.
I need to save some space for beer.

911
00:54:00,009 --> 00:54:02,039
Let's watch a movie
while drinking beer.

912
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:04,450
When will you go home?

913
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:06,109
I can't go home tonight.

914
00:54:06,750 --> 00:54:07,750
Why not?

915
00:54:08,319 --> 00:54:09,650
I'm eating ramyeon.

916
00:54:10,819 --> 00:54:12,495
Didn't you watch that movie?

917
00:54:12,519 --> 00:54:14,859
When you eat ramyeon
at a man's place, you can't go home.

918
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:18,430
I see. Really?

919
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:19,990
- Yes.
- I see.

920
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:21,759
Eat up.

921
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:29,039
We were best friends.

922
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:33,217
Here.

923
00:54:33,241 --> 00:54:35,856
- Hey.
- This is nice.

924
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:39,886
Hey, are they...

925
00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:42,119
Doesn't this feel like
we're camping?

926
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:45,426
You're going to drink one too?

927
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:47,490
I'm good at drinking beer now.

928
00:54:47,589 --> 00:54:48,589
Cheers.

929
00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:54,029
Hey, listen. He's so handsome.

930
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,130
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

931
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:01,670
I've dreamed of drinking beer
with you for so long.

932
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:05,809
I also dreamed of drinking
beer with you too.

933
00:55:06,509 --> 00:55:08,880
Then, we can drink beer
together often from now on.

934
00:55:11,279 --> 00:55:12,480
This is not good.

935
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:13,710
What do you mean?

936
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:15,950
I keep getting ambitious.

937
00:55:17,289 --> 00:55:18,650
In what ways?

938
00:55:19,849 --> 00:55:23,690
I want to make you
the happiest woman on earth.

939
00:55:26,059 --> 00:55:28,859
My gosh, this is not good either.

940
00:55:30,630 --> 00:55:31,799
Why?

941
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:36,099
Because I want to make you
happier than that.

942
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:24,990
It's done.

943
00:56:34,630 --> 00:56:35,730
Where are you?

944
00:56:36,029 --> 00:56:37,529
I'm on my way now.

945
00:56:38,769 --> 00:56:40,170
I'm so nervous.

946
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:42,200
Did you take the calming pill?

947
00:56:42,269 --> 00:56:44,140
I took it 30 minutes ago.

948
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:46,410
But why am I so nervous?

949
00:56:46,869 --> 00:56:48,055
I'm more nervous than...

950
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:50,199
when I had to attend
promotional interviews in the US.

951
00:56:50,509 --> 00:56:52,980
Don't worry.
I'm sure you'll do a great job.

952
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:56,920
But I'll only be able to calm down
once I see your face.

953
00:56:58,190 --> 00:56:59,950
I'll try to get there
as soon as possible.

954
00:57:01,059 --> 00:57:02,160
Okay.

955
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:04,206
I'll try to hang in there
until you arrive.

956
00:57:04,230 --> 00:57:05,430
Get here safely.

957
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:08,160
Okay. I'll see you there.

958
00:57:21,509 --> 00:57:24,549
I still remember too many memories.

959
00:57:27,619 --> 00:57:30,450
I'm pretty sure these memories
will not fade away...

960
00:57:31,849 --> 00:57:33,549
for the rest of my life.

961
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:36,319
They will remain inside me
like tree rings.

962
00:57:49,670 --> 00:57:52,539
(Find Me in Your Memory)

963
00:58:01,849 --> 00:58:03,896
Isn't this more nervous
than the actual filming?

964
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:05,220
I think so.

965
00:58:05,789 --> 00:58:08,390
Now, we will receive questions
from the reporters.

966
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:12,206
You decided to come back
with a Korean movie.

967
00:58:12,230 --> 00:58:13,866
After you've been active
in Hollywood,

968
00:58:13,890 --> 00:58:16,275
it's been a while since you've been
active in the Korean movie industry.

969
00:58:16,299 --> 00:58:17,359
How does it feel?

970
00:58:17,569 --> 00:58:18,630
Well,

971
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:20,916
first of all, it was really great
to say my lines...

972
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:23,170
in Korean, not English.

973
00:58:25,039 --> 00:58:28,440
I thought I was used to doing that,
but it felt new.

974
00:58:29,079 --> 00:58:31,656
Ms. Yeo, you came back to Korea
after two years,

975
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:34,226
so it has been a while
since you met with your Korean fans.

976
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:36,180
Please share a few words for them.

977
00:58:42,059 --> 00:58:44,190
("Find Me in Your Memory")

978
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:54,569
I missed you so much,

979
00:58:58,369 --> 00:58:59,740
and I wanted to see you.

980
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:05,726
I could adapt quickly
in an unfamiliar environment...

981
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:08,579
thanks to the support my fans showed
even while I was overseas.

982
00:59:09,019 --> 00:59:11,049
I really want to thank you.

983
00:59:11,549 --> 00:59:14,535
We're very glad to
have you back in Korea,

984
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:16,565
but you must have been torn.

985
00:59:16,589 --> 00:59:20,206
Why did you decide to film
"Find Me in Your Memory"...

986
00:59:20,230 --> 00:59:23,099
instead of "Kill the Venus 3",
which is guaranteed to be a hit.

987
00:59:24,930 --> 00:59:30,216
Actually, I begged her to join me
because I desperately wanted to...

988
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:32,170
make this film with her.

989
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:38,549
Of course, it's because I trusted
the scenario and the director.

990
00:59:38,609 --> 00:59:40,450
And the story was perfect too.

991
00:59:41,619 --> 00:59:44,250
That's my official statement,

992
00:59:45,549 --> 00:59:47,619
but someone made an analysis...

993
00:59:48,220 --> 00:59:52,490
and said doing this film will be
a huge plus to my future career.

994
00:59:52,829 --> 00:59:53,930
Really?

995
00:59:54,329 --> 00:59:58,500
I should show
my deepest gratitude to that person.

996
00:59:58,869 --> 01:00:00,000
Thank you.

997
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:04,416
Ms. Yeo, why did you decide...

998
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:07,470
to return to Korea
after your long hiatus?

999
01:00:07,809 --> 01:00:11,710
Is there any other reason
other than the film itself?

1000
01:00:13,609 --> 01:00:15,129
Is it because of
Anchor Lee Jeong Hoon?

1001
01:00:25,130 --> 01:00:26,130
No.

1002
01:00:27,430 --> 01:00:28,730
It was for me.

1003
01:00:31,299 --> 01:00:32,430
I decided...

1004
01:00:33,769 --> 01:00:36,940
to become a person
who's remembered daily and forever.

1005
01:00:40,009 --> 01:00:42,180
I wanted to remember and love...

1006
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:44,880
in this place.

1007
01:00:54,289 --> 01:00:55,789
I'm Lee Jeong Hoon of HBN.

1008
01:01:04,569 --> 01:01:07,170
There's a question
I'd like to ask you.

1009
01:01:12,769 --> 01:01:15,809
Now I know how to etch
those memories in my heart...

1010
01:01:16,579 --> 01:01:18,410
and move forward.

1011
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:25,049
I know how those memories can become
good memories, not wounds.

1012
01:01:28,359 --> 01:01:31,730
I just need to
live this moment beautifully.

1013
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:42,869
(We thank Park Jin Woo
for his guest appearance.)

1014
01:02:29,049 --> 01:02:31,366
(We support our viewers' tomorrow
along with Jeong Hoon and Ha Jin.)

1015
01:02:31,390 --> 01:02:37,319
(Thank you for watching
Find Me in Your Memory.)
