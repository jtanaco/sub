(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:01:09,589 --> 00:01:11,093
What's wrong with them?

4
00:01:27,268 --> 00:01:28,414
Cheers.

5
00:01:29,979 --> 00:01:31,683
(Episode 6)

6
00:01:32,908 --> 00:01:35,024
Once, I caught someone...

7
00:01:35,209 --> 00:01:38,348
doing something perverted.

8
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:40,463
I checked his transportation card history,

9
00:01:40,748 --> 00:01:43,534
and he had taken the first train from Cheonan at 5am.

10
00:01:44,089 --> 00:01:46,119
They're so diligent.

11
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:49,959
Yes. But he claims he came to see a friend.

12
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:52,658
Who meets a friend at 7am?

13
00:01:52,658 --> 00:01:54,644
And two guys at that.

14
00:01:55,029 --> 00:01:56,644
I may be diligent,

15
00:01:57,138 --> 00:01:59,414
but I'd never get up to catch a 5am train to meet a friend.

16
00:01:59,699 --> 00:02:01,437
Soo Ho and Officer Lee are close,

17
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:02,637
but they don't even make eye contact in the morning.

18
00:02:02,638 --> 00:02:03,813
That's true.

19
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,049
Last time, I went all the way to Incheon and caught this punk,

20
00:02:08,049 --> 00:02:09,224
and he...

21
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:15,164
It got cut again.

22
00:02:17,119 --> 00:02:19,034
I rolled down like 10 steps,

23
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:21,134
so it's to be expected.

24
00:02:22,228 --> 00:02:25,658
Another time, I followed him to Incheon and arrested him,

25
00:02:25,658 --> 00:02:29,543
and I realized he was wearing our handcuff.

26
00:02:29,769 --> 00:02:32,543
So I asked him while I was arresting him,

27
00:02:35,139 --> 00:02:36,779
and he had gotten loose and run away.

28
00:02:36,779 --> 00:02:38,513
Didn't it hurt?

29
00:02:40,049 --> 00:02:41,124
What?

30
00:02:41,309 --> 00:02:43,493
Hye Jin told me.

31
00:02:45,448 --> 00:02:47,194
Oh, well...

32
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:50,393
I wanted to try fighting him.

33
00:02:50,918 --> 00:02:54,404
We both did martial arts. I wanted to see if he was better.

34
00:02:55,128 --> 00:02:59,134
He seemed to need a sparring partner too. So I...

35
00:03:17,348 --> 00:03:19,094
What? What are you doing?

36
00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:21,923
Open up.

37
00:03:23,559 --> 00:03:25,363
It won't heal if you don't treat it.

38
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:57,094
I got a cut here too.

39
00:04:01,329 --> 00:04:04,134
Okay. I see. You got a cut there too.

40
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:09,974
Darn it. He hit me for real.

41
00:04:10,369 --> 00:04:11,944
It hurt so much.

42
00:04:16,368 --> 00:04:17,514
Sorry.

43
00:04:17,808 --> 00:04:21,123
Seriously. You're such a crybaby, Chief.

44
00:04:22,908 --> 00:04:24,224
Pro fighters are different.

45
00:04:24,819 --> 00:04:26,524
Don't do that again.

46
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:30,459
Here comes the first train.

47
00:04:30,459 --> 00:04:33,389
The train to Seongsu is now approaching.

48
00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:36,029
If you party all night long in Hongdae on Club Day...

49
00:04:36,029 --> 00:04:37,933
and take the first train, you disappear.

50
00:04:38,899 --> 00:04:40,803
You're a natural-born detective.

51
00:04:41,868 --> 00:04:43,639
Let's get on.

52
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:46,014
Let's see whether or not we disappear.

53
00:04:46,038 --> 00:04:48,644
- Okay. - The doors are opening.

54
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:03,557
Take a nap if you're tired.

55
00:05:03,558 --> 00:05:05,464
I'll wake you when we're there...

56
00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:45,758
I'm Chief Inspector Ko Ji Seok with the Subway Police.

57
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,604
May I see your bag?

58
00:06:59,968 --> 00:07:02,813
That punk isn't just a petty thief.

59
00:07:14,848 --> 00:07:15,923
What...

60
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:23,758
That jerk.

61
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,173
Please stand clear of the closing doors.

62
00:07:40,978 --> 00:07:42,053
(Ewha Womans University Station)

63
00:07:50,718 --> 00:07:51,863
Newbie.

64
00:08:03,368 --> 00:08:05,839
Chief, why did you leave me...

65
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:06,914
Listen.

66
00:08:08,509 --> 00:08:10,483
- Yes? - There's a petty thief...

67
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,784
with a knife on that train.

68
00:08:13,308 --> 00:08:15,348
- What? - He's dangerous,

69
00:08:15,348 --> 00:08:17,423
so follow my orders exactly.

70
00:08:20,149 --> 00:08:21,189
Okay.

71
00:08:21,189 --> 00:08:23,224
At the left end of the seats across from you,

72
00:08:23,858 --> 00:08:27,164
there's a woman with short hair in a black dress, sleeping.

73
00:08:27,858 --> 00:08:31,074
She's his victim, so tell her you're an officer...

74
00:08:31,459 --> 00:08:33,003
and exit at the next stop with her.

75
00:08:33,769 --> 00:08:35,068
What about the thief?

76
00:08:35,068 --> 00:08:36,243
Leave him.

77
00:08:36,369 --> 00:08:38,174
I have my handcuffs.

78
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:42,168
Is he wearing a black cap and...

79
00:08:42,168 --> 00:08:43,383
Newbie!

80
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:46,753
Get off with the victim.

81
00:08:46,979 --> 00:08:49,548
I can catch a petty thief.

82
00:08:49,548 --> 00:08:51,694
He isn't just a petty thief.

83
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:54,623
I told you why I came here, right?

84
00:08:54,818 --> 00:08:57,233
Because the most I get are petty thieves with nail clippers.

85
00:08:57,818 --> 00:08:59,158
That's true.

86
00:08:59,158 --> 00:09:02,029
That's your conviction, not mine.

87
00:09:02,029 --> 00:09:03,503
That's not it.

88
00:09:04,658 --> 00:09:06,558
Weapon possession increases the sentence,

89
00:09:06,558 --> 00:09:09,204
so subway thieves do not carry knives.

90
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:12,814
And he didn't touch her gold jewelry.

91
00:09:13,198 --> 00:09:16,643
Because most people use credit cards, the petty thieves...

92
00:09:17,009 --> 00:09:19,214
go after jewelry first before wallets.

93
00:09:19,438 --> 00:09:21,283
Something is off about him.

94
00:09:23,349 --> 00:09:26,153
I'm on the next train, so get off at the next stop.

95
00:09:26,619 --> 00:09:30,663
I promise to catch him again.

96
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:32,334
Okay.

97
00:09:32,658 --> 00:09:35,204
I'll get off with the victim then.

98
00:09:57,078 --> 00:09:58,753
Stand clear of the closing doors.

99
00:10:04,259 --> 00:10:05,434
(Ahyeon)

100
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:11,304
Chief!

101
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,613
I even took off my heels. It was so hard holding myself back.

102
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:20,639
Aren't you proud of me?

103
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:24,054
Good job, Newbie. You're all grown up.

104
00:10:26,139 --> 00:10:28,349
We'll call you as soon as we recover your wallet.

105
00:10:28,349 --> 00:10:30,794
- Thank you. - Get home safely.

106
00:10:31,749 --> 00:10:32,993
Get home safely.

107
00:10:35,889 --> 00:10:36,964
Officer Lee.

108
00:10:37,158 --> 00:10:39,658
See if he was caught on camera at Hongik University Station.

109
00:10:39,658 --> 00:10:40,733
Yes, sir.

110
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:46,104
If we catch him, we can take the lead this quarter.

111
00:10:48,168 --> 00:10:49,674
Hello, Chief Gong.

112
00:10:51,298 --> 00:10:55,684
I'm sorry, but may I see complaints regarding petty thieves...

113
00:10:55,869 --> 00:10:57,214
on the first train at Hongik University Station?

114
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,184
Why? That's my station.

115
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:02,048
I saw a weird one.

116
00:11:02,048 --> 00:11:06,023
He had a weapon, and took the victim's wallet and not jewelry.

117
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:08,918
He's short, wore a cap with an eagle...

118
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:12,163
Oh, him. He's so quick. I lost him once too.

119
00:11:12,259 --> 00:11:13,827
But yes, he is weird.

120
00:11:13,828 --> 00:11:16,558
He always targets the first train after Hongdae Club Day.

121
00:11:16,558 --> 00:11:19,674
He only robs people on the first train after Club Day?

122
00:11:19,828 --> 00:11:22,403
Probably because there are so many drunk people.

123
00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:26,574
If you lost him once,

124
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:30,113
you must have checked his transportation card.

125
00:11:31,239 --> 00:11:32,554
Do you know his identity?

126
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:34,883
If I did, I would've caught him already.

127
00:11:34,948 --> 00:11:38,294
He always uses a single-ride card, so we found nothing.

128
00:11:38,649 --> 00:11:39,848
I see.

129
00:11:39,849 --> 00:11:42,917
Then may I meet the victims...

130
00:11:42,918 --> 00:11:45,663
whose wallets he stole?

131
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:51,104
There are many victims, so we'll find a clue once we meet them all.

132
00:11:51,729 --> 00:11:55,743
Why is Chief Gong actually helping us?

133
00:11:55,869 --> 00:11:57,844
He said he saw us dancing...

134
00:11:58,769 --> 00:11:59,944
last night.

135
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,444
He felt like he was too mean.

136
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:17,464
So you don't remember anything about the thief, right?

137
00:12:18,889 --> 00:12:21,733
No. I completely blacked out.

138
00:12:21,828 --> 00:12:25,574
Were you wearing any gold jewelry or anything valuable that day?

139
00:12:27,668 --> 00:12:29,604
I was since I went clubbing.

140
00:12:30,769 --> 00:12:33,773
And yet, he only took your wallet.

141
00:12:39,739 --> 00:12:42,354
For all three, he left the valuables and only took their wallets.

142
00:12:42,749 --> 00:12:43,849
Why?

143
00:12:43,849 --> 00:12:45,824
We need to find a lead.

144
00:12:47,249 --> 00:12:48,393
Here.

145
00:12:55,158 --> 00:12:56,604
Hong Ye Ra.

146
00:12:59,359 --> 00:13:00,773
Hong Ye Ra.

147
00:13:04,739 --> 00:13:07,938
Don't waste your time, and go home.

148
00:13:07,938 --> 00:13:10,314
No one has lived there for a while.

149
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:15,609
- Hello. - Sure.

150
00:13:15,609 --> 00:13:18,523
I'm Chief Inspector Ko Ji Seok of the Subway Police.

151
00:13:19,349 --> 00:13:21,464
So you're cops.

152
00:13:21,749 --> 00:13:24,133
You look different from the ones who came last time.

153
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:26,917
Were the police here?

154
00:13:26,918 --> 00:13:27,928
Yes.

155
00:13:27,928 --> 00:13:30,058
Would you please tell us what you know?

156
00:13:30,058 --> 00:13:33,434
This lady... What did they say? So...

157
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:36,768
she does an Internet broadcast. She's super famous here.

158
00:13:36,769 --> 00:13:40,068
But they said she suddenly disappeared during a broadcast.

159
00:13:40,068 --> 00:13:43,239
So detectives came by and asked me all sorts of things.

160
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,639
She disappeared while doing a broadcast?

161
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:46,854
Yes.

162
00:13:47,139 --> 00:13:49,749
Is this her?

163
00:13:49,749 --> 00:13:52,493
Yes, that's right. Yes.

164
00:13:58,389 --> 00:14:00,188
Based on the list of victims,

165
00:14:00,188 --> 00:14:03,058
Avocado had her wallet stolen on the 26th.

166
00:14:03,058 --> 00:14:05,003
The last day she posted on her vlog.

167
00:14:06,198 --> 00:14:08,344
She went missing the day her wallet was stolen.

168
00:14:09,629 --> 00:14:13,243

00:23:57,248 --> 00:23:59,464
Just ask him to see you again...

334
00:24:00,889 --> 00:24:04,603
Go and get the sketch artist right now.

335
00:24:04,728 --> 00:24:06,103
Yes, ma'am.

336
00:24:08,728 --> 00:24:09,803
Sit.

337
00:25:19,538 --> 00:25:21,639
But I think I better go.

338
00:25:21,639 --> 00:25:24,643
Newbie is by herself. I'm worried.

339
00:25:26,738 --> 00:25:27,879
"Worried"?

340
00:25:27,879 --> 00:25:30,109
Let's work on the composite early tomorrow morning.

341
00:25:30,109 --> 00:25:31,184
I'll call you.

342
00:27:18,588 --> 00:27:19,833
What is this?

343
00:27:22,429 --> 00:27:23,903
Did the power go out?

344
00:27:51,889 --> 00:27:53,093
Who are you?

345
00:28:14,709 --> 00:28:15,823
Newbie!

346
00:28:17,508 --> 00:28:18,994
Newbie!

347
00:28:46,139 --> 00:28:47,813
I have to catch him.

348
00:28:49,548 --> 00:28:51,524
I have to catch him.

349
00:28:59,318 --> 00:29:00,934
I have to catch him.

350
00:29:20,909 --> 00:29:22,083
Newbie.

351
00:29:23,709 --> 00:29:24,853
Newbie.

352
00:29:26,849 --> 00:29:27,954
Newbie!

353
00:29:29,949 --> 00:29:31,393
Chief.

354
00:29:35,988 --> 00:29:37,103
Newbie.

355
00:29:40,629 --> 00:29:42,704
What are you doing down here? Are you hurt?

356
00:29:45,699 --> 00:29:48,214
Why did the power go out?

357
00:29:49,169 --> 00:29:50,413
I'm sorry.

358
00:29:51,268 --> 00:29:52,484
Are you sure...

359
00:29:53,538 --> 00:29:54,784
you didn't get hurt?

360
00:29:58,949 --> 00:30:00,194
Did something...

361
00:30:01,219 --> 00:30:02,623
happen?

362
00:30:19,549 --> 00:30:24,549


363
00:30:42,959 --> 00:30:44,204
By the way, Newbie.

364
00:30:46,058 --> 00:30:47,934
Are you hiding something from me?

365
00:30:48,528 --> 00:30:49,744
Pardon?

366
00:30:50,268 --> 00:30:52,073
You look a little anxious.

367
00:30:53,639 --> 00:30:55,913
Also, someone was tailing you last time.

368
00:30:56,639 --> 00:30:59,214
No one was tailing me.

369
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:02,924
I checked,

370
00:31:03,478 --> 00:31:05,323
and he was just a pervert.

371
00:31:06,219 --> 00:31:10,524
I'm just startled, that's all. I'm scared of the dark.

372
00:31:11,349 --> 00:31:12,863
I'm glad it's nothing serious.

373
00:31:15,889 --> 00:31:17,103
Just a second.

374
00:31:29,808 --> 00:31:32,214
I thought you were fearless.

375
00:31:32,738 --> 00:31:34,083
Sleep tight.

376
00:31:45,959 --> 00:31:49,563
If you get scared, you can wake me up.

377
00:31:51,528 --> 00:31:53,373
I'll leave this open.

378
00:32:55,859 --> 00:32:57,034
Chief.

379
00:32:59,498 --> 00:33:01,873
I think I need to get stronger.

380
00:33:05,639 --> 00:33:06,913
I'm sorry.

381
00:34:14,999 --> 00:34:16,643
Why didn't you kill me?

382
00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:20,353
Why?

383
00:35:36,449 --> 00:35:38,524
(Employee Lounge, Authorized Personnel Only)

384
00:35:42,588 --> 00:35:44,404
They fixed it quick.

385
00:35:44,659 --> 00:35:45,898
Hi.

386
00:35:45,898 --> 00:35:47,999
- Hello. Did you sleep well? - Hey.

387
00:35:47,999 --> 00:35:49,028
Good morning.

388
00:35:49,028 --> 00:35:50,304
- Did you eat? - Yes.

389
00:35:51,269 --> 00:35:52,544
Goodness.

390
00:36:00,008 --> 00:36:01,953
- Chief. - Did you get some sleep?

391
00:36:05,148 --> 00:36:06,223
I'd like...

392
00:36:06,949 --> 00:36:08,763
- a new partner. - A partner...

393
00:36:11,048 --> 00:36:12,134
Me?

394
00:36:14,119 --> 00:36:15,333
You want to swap me out?

395
00:36:16,289 --> 00:36:17,404
Yes.

396
00:36:17,688 --> 00:36:20,203
What's this all about?

397
00:36:20,729 --> 00:36:22,603
Did you two fight again last night?

398
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:25,004
Who wants to be my partner?

399
00:36:25,699 --> 00:36:27,214
Do you want to be my partner?

400
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:31,139
Partner, I'm going to order an expandable baton.

401
00:36:31,139 --> 00:36:32,238
Should we look together?

402
00:36:32,238 --> 00:36:34,579
- Of course. We're partners. - You're so mean.

403
00:36:34,579 --> 00:36:35,849
I'm not an infectious disease or anything.

404
00:36:35,849 --> 00:36:38,749
Nice. I like silver.

405
00:36:38,749 --> 00:36:40,219
- Silver? - That's right.

406
00:36:40,219 --> 00:36:41,594
Should I go with pink?

407
00:36:42,488 --> 00:36:43,964
There's no pink.

408
00:36:46,858 --> 00:36:47,964
Is it...

409
00:36:49,088 --> 00:36:51,063
because I left you all alone...

410
00:36:51,988 --> 00:36:53,203
in the dark last night?

411
00:36:54,729 --> 00:36:57,674
I didn't know the power would go out. I already apologized.

412
00:36:58,128 --> 00:37:00,243
- Why are you... - That's not why.

413
00:37:03,508 --> 00:37:04,583
Then?

414
00:37:05,579 --> 00:37:06,654
Because...

415
00:37:11,048 --> 00:37:13,393
I don't think we're a good fit.

416
00:37:21,318 --> 00:37:22,404
Come with me.

417
00:37:39,639 --> 00:37:40,714
Chief.

418
00:37:41,938 --> 00:37:43,453
When were we ever a good fit?

419
00:37:44,278 --> 00:37:45,918
I said from the get-go...

420
00:37:45,918 --> 00:37:48,094
that we weren't a good fit and that it wouldn't work.

421
00:37:49,088 --> 00:37:50,548
From the first time we met.

422
00:37:50,548 --> 00:37:53,364
We met with you handcuffing me.

423
00:37:53,719 --> 00:37:54,789
I'm sorry about...

424
00:37:54,789 --> 00:37:56,804
But you insisted on joining us.

425
00:37:58,858 --> 00:38:00,904
I really didn't want to say this,

426
00:38:01,659 --> 00:38:03,643
but the past month that I worked with you...

427
00:38:03,969 --> 00:38:07,143
was more exhausting than my past two years combined.

428
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:09,544
Exactly.

429
00:38:10,309 --> 00:38:13,013
It's better if we switch. It would be less exhausting.

430
00:38:13,378 --> 00:38:15,183
Are you kidding me? Seriously?

431
00:38:19,219 --> 00:38:21,554
We're finally starting to work well together.

432
00:38:22,148 --> 00:38:24,663
I worked so hard to get this far.

433
00:38:25,389 --> 00:38:28,889
Exactly. I'm saying stop working so hard now.

434
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:31,433
Who can put up with you other than me in the Subway Police?

435
00:38:32,458 --> 00:38:35,643
Were you "putting up" with me?

436
00:38:43,469 --> 00:38:46,338
- That's not what I mean. - You should've said you hated me!

437
00:38:46,338 --> 00:38:47,714
I never said...

438
00:38:49,708 --> 00:38:51,623
It's not that I hate you.

439
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:55,824
Seriously.

440
00:38:58,349 --> 00:38:59,734
You said...

441
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:04,634
I was your seatbelt and stuff before.

442
00:39:08,458 --> 00:39:12,103
How could your feelings change so quickly? And overnight too!

443
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:23,953
They're talking about switching partners, right?

444
00:39:24,548 --> 00:39:26,493
They're not breaking up, right?

445
00:39:27,548 --> 00:39:28,623
I'm not sure.

446
00:39:35,559 --> 00:39:37,563
Let's not be emotional.

447
00:39:39,999 --> 00:39:42,074
Let's take some time to cool off.

448
00:39:45,269 --> 00:39:46,973
Until we solve the Avocado case.

449
00:39:47,369 --> 00:39:48,513
Avocado.

450
00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:50,413
What did Metro say?

451
00:39:50,809 --> 00:39:52,654
There's a connection between Avocado and the petty thief.

452
00:39:52,979 --> 00:39:55,154
He was caught on her vlog.

453
00:39:55,409 --> 00:39:56,409
Really?

454
00:39:56,409 --> 00:39:58,008
Metro is taking him and Avocado,

455
00:39:58,008 --> 00:40:00,548
and we'll meet the other victims he robbed...

456
00:40:00,548 --> 00:40:01,893
- Let's go. - Wait.

457
00:40:02,749 --> 00:40:03,893
Wait for me.

458
00:40:04,818 --> 00:40:06,258
Is it jammed?

459
00:40:06,258 --> 00:40:08,234
- Yes, I think so. - See you later.

460
00:40:11,229 --> 00:40:12,373
See you later.

461
00:40:15,099 --> 00:40:16,344
What's going on?

462
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:54,743
Where did you find it?

463
00:40:56,269 --> 00:40:57,984
So that's where I dropped my wallet.

464
00:40:58,469 --> 00:41:00,413
Okay. Just a minute.

465
00:41:05,148 --> 00:41:07,723
I'll go there to pick up my wallet.

466
00:41:08,349 --> 00:41:09,524
Thank you.

467
00:41:11,889 --> 00:41:13,063
May I help you?

468
00:41:13,159 --> 00:41:15,134
Did you find your wallet?

469
00:41:15,219 --> 00:41:16,229
Yes.

470
00:41:16,229 --> 00:41:18,504
We're detectives with the Subway Police.

471
00:41:19,458 --> 00:41:21,603
You had reported that you lost your wallet.

472
00:41:21,699 --> 00:41:24,404
I thought someone had stolen it.

473
00:41:24,628 --> 00:41:26,869
I had expensive concert tickets in my wallet,

474
00:41:26,869 --> 00:41:28,544
which was why I reported it,

475
00:41:28,798 --> 00:41:30,484
but I guess it wasn't a pickpocket.

476
00:41:31,269 --> 00:41:33,054
Please cancel my report.

477
00:41:35,679 --> 00:41:38,953
Why did you think it was a pickpocket?

478
00:41:39,318 --> 00:41:42,763
Since I scanned my card when I got on the train.

479
00:41:43,249 --> 00:41:44,864
But...

480
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:48,563
when I checked when I got off, my wallet wasn't there.

481
00:41:49,059 --> 00:41:50,763
I guess I dropped it somewhere...

482
00:41:51,059 --> 00:41:53,304
since he said the tickets and money are all there.

483
00:41:54,499 --> 00:41:55,634
I see.

484
00:41:57,099 --> 00:41:58,344
Goodbye.

485
00:42:00,568 --> 00:42:03,183
It's late. Let's go to the next one.

486
00:42:05,979 --> 00:42:07,054
Okay.

487
00:42:08,378 --> 00:42:09,484
Park Yoo Mi.

488
00:42:10,878 --> 00:42:11,984
Park Yoo Mi.

489
00:42:13,479 --> 00:42:14,723
Is anyone home?

490
00:42:16,548 --> 00:42:18,393
It looks like she hasn't been home in a while.

491
00:42:18,949 --> 00:42:21,294
I guess you didn't know.

492
00:42:22,389 --> 00:42:26,229
No, no. She reported her wallet stolen, so we came to talk to her,

493
00:42:26,229 --> 00:42:27,433
but we couldn't reach her.

494
00:42:28,528 --> 00:42:29,603
Okay.

495
00:42:31,128 --> 00:42:32,599
Park Yoo Mi's mother...

496
00:42:32,599 --> 00:42:35,013
thinks she still lives here.

497
00:42:35,668 --> 00:42:37,484
So her family doesn't know where she is either.

498
00:42:42,008 --> 00:42:43,083
Hi, Soo Ho.

499
00:42:44,849 --> 00:42:47,824
- Did you meet the victim? - No. She isn't home.

500
00:42:48,048 --> 00:42:49,449
Her friends say...

501
00:42:49,449 --> 00:42:51,694
they haven't been able to reach her since they went clubbing.

502
00:42:51,818 --> 00:42:53,864
I see. It's the same as here.

503
00:42:54,659 --> 00:42:56,804
Get all the surveillance videos from near her place.

504
00:42:57,458 --> 00:42:58,904
Okay. Bye.

505
00:43:00,458 --> 00:43:04,304
That means two more women went missing on top of Avocado.

506
00:43:05,798 --> 00:43:08,174
The ghost story is real.

507
00:43:09,409 --> 00:43:11,183
What happened?

508
00:43:15,008 --> 00:43:16,654
What? Why?

509
00:43:17,079 --> 00:43:18,554
What?

510
00:43:18,778 --> 00:43:21,324
- We'll find a clue inside. - That's breaking and entering.

511
00:43:21,679 --> 00:43:23,424
Newbie. Snap out of it.

512
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:26,094
Snap out of it.

513
00:43:26,918 --> 00:43:27,993
Stop it.

514
00:43:28,219 --> 00:43:29,433
I thought you finally grew up.

515
00:43:29,559 --> 00:43:31,433
I'm doing this because I grew up.

516
00:43:31,729 --> 00:43:34,533
I should do what I must at all costs.

517
00:43:39,238 --> 00:43:42,844
Are you rebelling because you don't want to be my partner?

518
00:43:44,108 --> 00:43:45,243
But...

519
00:43:46,238 --> 00:43:49,223
That's not it. Darn it.

520
00:43:54,878 --> 00:43:57,364
Officer Lee and Soo Ho, check the surveillance cameras.

521
00:43:58,048 --> 00:44:00,933
If the victims are alive, they'll be on them somewhere.

522
00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:05,603
Newbie and I'll check their credit card uses after their disappearance.

523
00:44:06,358 --> 00:44:07,504
Okay.

524
00:44:08,628 --> 00:44:11,429
Hello, this is the Subway Police. I'd like to see...

525
00:44:11,429 --> 00:44:15,243
Park Yoo Mi's credit card transaction list.

526
00:44:15,438 --> 00:44:17,714
Please fax it to me. Thank you.

527
00:44:24,309 --> 00:44:25,384
(Credit Card Transaction Details)

528
00:44:26,949 --> 00:44:28,324
(Credit Card Transaction Details)

529
00:44:30,818 --> 00:44:31,918
Check this.

530
00:44:31,918 --> 00:44:33,634
I'll check these.

531
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:43,544
What's this?

532
00:44:44,128 --> 00:44:46,774
This woman is fine.

533
00:44:46,898 --> 00:44:48,643
She's buying something at a convenience store.

534
00:44:54,639 --> 00:44:57,708
Then she used her credit card herself.

535
00:44:57,708 --> 00:45:01,493
The other victims are going around perfectly fine too.

536
00:45:01,548 --> 00:45:03,424
They were caught by every camera.

537
00:45:04,289 --> 00:45:07,393
- Then all the victims... - Are alive.

538
00:45:08,988 --> 00:45:12,873
I know we should be happy, but...

539
00:45:13,929 --> 00:45:16,044
what were we doing all this time?

540
00:45:17,429 --> 00:45:20,743
The ghost story is not real.

541
00:45:23,168 --> 00:45:24,384
Well...

542
00:45:25,008 --> 00:45:26,683
That is a relief.

543
00:45:29,179 --> 00:45:31,054
- But... - Lieutenant.

544
00:45:31,679 --> 00:45:33,223
We found Avocado.

545
00:45:36,789 --> 00:45:39,917
I checked the surveillance cameras near where her card was used,

546
00:45:39,918 --> 00:45:41,634
and I think she's staying at a studio apartment.

547
00:45:42,458 --> 00:45:43,904
I knew it.

548
00:45:44,229 --> 00:45:45,558
What a waste of time.

549
00:45:45,559 --> 00:45:46,929
Isn't it great she's alive?

550
00:45:46,929 --> 00:45:50,428
Call the studio and ask her why she moved,

551
00:45:50,429 --> 00:45:51,603
and close the case.

552
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,699
We started this investigation thinking they went missing,

553
00:45:53,699 --> 00:45:54,897
but none of them did.

554
00:45:54,898 --> 00:45:56,738
But none of them are going home.

555
00:45:56,738 --> 00:45:59,938
They're not minors. Must the police investigate why they don't go home?

556
00:45:59,938 --> 00:46:02,378
The convenience store Park Yoo Mi goes to isn't far from here.

557
00:46:02,378 --> 00:46:04,723
- Can't we just go and... - And what will you say?

558
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:07,519
"We called after you reported your wallet stolen,"

559
00:46:07,519 --> 00:46:09,763
"but you wouldn't answer your phone and weren't home,"

560
00:46:09,818 --> 00:46:11,917
"so we checked your credit card transactions..."

561
00:46:11,918 --> 00:46:13,518
"and the convenience store you frequent..."

562
00:46:13,519 --> 00:46:17,429
"and were staking out in secret. We didn't expect to see you."

563
00:46:17,429 --> 00:46:19,699
Is that what we should do? Because of one wallet?

564
00:46:19,699 --> 00:46:22,274
- That's a stalker, not a cop. - Yes.

565
00:46:26,369 --> 00:46:29,198
It's weird that both of them won't go home.

566
00:46:29,199 --> 00:46:31,909
Something may have happened like with Avocado.

567
00:46:31,909 --> 00:46:33,353
Even with Avocado,

568
00:46:33,438 --> 00:46:36,249
we don't know exactly what happened.

569
00:46:36,249 --> 00:46:38,148
I still need to check.

570
00:46:38,148 --> 00:46:39,924
This isn't ours to investigate.

571
00:46:45,988 --> 00:46:47,688
They say you can't change people.

572
00:46:47,688 --> 00:46:49,528
Your bad habit is coming back!

573
00:46:49,528 --> 00:46:51,103
That's what I'd like to say.

574
00:46:51,789 --> 00:46:54,074
You keep backing down while investigating.

575
00:46:54,559 --> 00:46:56,603
It must really be an illness.

576
00:46:57,999 --> 00:46:59,813
What? Why...

577
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:04,513
Is this the Narcotics Unit? This is Ko Ji Seok, Subway Police.

578
00:47:04,708 --> 00:47:06,639
I'd like to report a narcotics case.

579
00:47:06,639 --> 00:47:08,214
Call the lady...

580
00:47:08,539 --> 00:47:11,208
and tell her we can't investigate.

581
00:47:11,208 --> 00:47:12,353
About the Kim Won Tae case.

582
00:47:14,219 --> 00:47:15,654
Let's drop it.

583
00:47:16,088 --> 00:47:19,734
Is that why she doesn't want to be my partner?

584
00:47:22,929 --> 00:47:24,364
What is it?

585
00:47:28,099 --> 00:47:29,274
Fine.

586
00:47:29,929 --> 00:47:32,429
It's late. Let's go tomorrow.

587
00:47:32,429 --> 00:47:33,643
Let's go.

588
00:47:42,208 --> 00:47:43,754
Have a good day.

589
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:47,254
That stings.

590
00:47:47,548 --> 00:47:48,694
Let me see.

591
00:47:49,988 --> 00:47:51,694
Goodness.

592
00:47:52,418 --> 00:47:53,663
I'm fine.

593
00:47:54,519 --> 00:47:55,594
That stings.

594
00:47:56,688 --> 00:47:57,964
Here.

595
00:48:05,099 --> 00:48:06,513
Hello.

596
00:48:12,539 --> 00:48:14,683
Park Yoo Mi, right?

597
00:48:20,179 --> 00:48:22,254
He only stole my wallet.

598
00:48:23,449 --> 00:48:25,723
There was nothing else.

599
00:48:26,619 --> 00:48:28,763
Is that really true?

600
00:48:30,258 --> 00:48:31,404
Yes.

601
00:48:45,809 --> 00:48:47,884
Sorry. Excuse me.

602
00:48:54,778 --> 00:48:57,063
Hi, Ma Ri. Yes.

603
00:48:58,719 --> 00:49:00,433
Okay, I'll check.

604
00:49:03,628 --> 00:49:06,099
Replay the surveillance video of Avocado.

605
00:49:06,099 --> 00:49:07,203
Okay.

606
00:49:26,519 --> 00:49:28,054
(Seoun Metropolitan Police Agency)

607
00:49:34,358 --> 00:49:36,504
Park and come in. I'll go in first.

608
00:49:36,929 --> 00:49:38,004
Okay.

609
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:42,473
- Ji Seok. - Hey, Woo Hyuk.

610
00:49:50,838 --> 00:49:54,384
When do you suddenly lose all respect for a supervisor?

611
00:49:56,349 --> 00:50:00,194
Are you asking me about your ex-girlfriend?

612
00:50:03,789 --> 00:50:06,694
Why? Did Ryung say she doesn't like you?

613
00:50:08,889 --> 00:50:10,134
Yes.

614
00:50:10,789 --> 00:50:12,134
She doesn't want to be my partner.

615
00:50:12,628 --> 00:50:15,329
Not wanting to be your partner is different...

616
00:50:15,329 --> 00:50:16,528
from disliking you.

617
00:50:16,528 --> 00:50:18,444
How is that different? It's the same.

618
00:50:18,568 --> 00:50:20,639
You seem to be overreacting.

619
00:50:20,639 --> 00:50:23,643
Take it purely professionally. Professionally.

620
00:50:36,289 --> 00:50:38,364
Of course, I take it professionally.

621
00:50:38,619 --> 00:50:40,194
How else would I take it?

622
00:50:40,318 --> 00:50:41,663
Detective Kim.

623
00:50:42,318 --> 00:50:44,404
- Do you have a minute? - Sure.

624
00:50:54,539 --> 00:50:58,214
Are you really okay? Are you not hurt?

625
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:19,303
Are you really okay? Are you not hurt?

626
00:51:36,248 --> 00:51:38,163
I'm not asking for your concern.

627
00:51:38,518 --> 00:51:41,119
I told you in case it would help with the investigation.

628
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:43,688
So you're positive the guy who came that night...

629
00:51:43,688 --> 00:51:46,159
is the Subway Ghost, right?

630
00:51:46,159 --> 00:51:47,627
That's right.

631
00:51:47,628 --> 00:51:50,073
Who else would roam around the station at that hour?

632
00:51:53,239 --> 00:51:55,174
I know it's hard to believe,

633
00:51:55,338 --> 00:51:57,044
and you don't have to believe me.

634
00:51:58,809 --> 00:52:01,484
Just run an analysis on this for me.

635
00:52:02,009 --> 00:52:04,348
I found it in the tunnel, but there's no case number...

636
00:52:04,349 --> 00:52:05,509
and I can't request an analysis.

637
00:52:05,509 --> 00:52:09,223
It's a bit clean for something found in the tunnel.

638
00:52:09,418 --> 00:52:11,493
I thought that was suspicious too.

639
00:52:12,719 --> 00:52:14,893
I'll let you know as soon as I get the results.

640
00:52:15,018 --> 00:52:17,489
And when we investigate suspects on our end,

641
00:52:17,489 --> 00:52:20,533
I'll make sure to check if any of them has a shoulder tick.

642
00:52:20,858 --> 00:52:22,104
Thank you.

643
00:52:22,799 --> 00:52:26,643
And let me ask you for one more favor.

644
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:31,214
Please don't tell Lieutenant Ha. She won't be interested, anyway.

645
00:52:31,409 --> 00:52:33,254
If she finds out I've been going into the tunnel,

646
00:52:33,779 --> 00:52:36,183
it'll put Chief Ko in trouble too.

647
00:52:36,679 --> 00:52:39,953
How come you don't want to be Ji Seok's partner anymore?

648
00:52:42,049 --> 00:52:43,363
Because I don't want to ruin this.

649
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:47,493
You like him, don't you?

650
00:52:48,489 --> 00:52:49,964
It's not that.

651
00:52:50,029 --> 00:52:51,904
I keep on wanting to rely on him when I'm with him.

652
00:52:55,329 --> 00:52:56,433
I'll get going.

653
00:52:56,799 --> 00:52:58,874
Then, do you want me to help you?

654
00:53:03,809 --> 00:53:06,654
How did you know Avocado was a victim of sexual assault?

655
00:53:07,438 --> 00:53:10,424
After we talked, I noticed the signs of a rape victim.

656
00:53:10,748 --> 00:53:12,884
She'd flinch if a strange man passed by.

657
00:53:13,179 --> 00:53:14,949
- What about you? - She'd wipe things incessantly,

658
00:53:14,949 --> 00:53:18,024
like the coffee ring on the table and dust on her sleeves.

659
00:53:18,088 --> 00:53:21,489
She feels like her body was spoiled,

660
00:53:21,489 --> 00:53:23,088
so she showed compulsive symptoms.

661
00:53:23,088 --> 00:53:26,188
Yes. She can't look at stains because it reminds her of herself.

662
00:53:26,188 --> 00:53:27,734
That's why...

663
00:53:28,599 --> 00:53:29,834
I didn't know.

664
00:53:30,168 --> 00:53:31,703
How would an officer like you know that?

665
00:53:34,068 --> 00:53:36,809
First of all, all of the women had bob cuts.

666
00:53:36,809 --> 00:53:38,268
That means he has a particular taste.

667
00:53:38,268 --> 00:53:41,154
Out of them, only the women who live alone were attacked.

668
00:53:41,179 --> 00:53:43,179
That's why he stole their wallets.

669
00:53:43,179 --> 00:53:45,608
He already saw that they're his taste.

670
00:53:45,608 --> 00:53:47,748
He needed the addresses on their IDs so he could check if they lived...

671
00:53:47,748 --> 00:53:49,723
in multiplex studio apartments which are easy to break into.

672
00:53:49,989 --> 00:53:51,694
That explains why he didn't steal their jewelry.

673
00:53:52,018 --> 00:53:54,958
He targeted women who went clubbing all night because...

674
00:53:54,958 --> 00:53:57,829
He probably thought they deserved it.

675
00:53:57,829 --> 00:53:59,727
He must've said what he thought out loud.

676
00:53:59,728 --> 00:54:01,458
That would make the victims get timid...

677
00:54:01,458 --> 00:54:03,998
and blame themselves, leading them to hide even more.

678
00:54:03,998 --> 00:54:05,369
If you party all night in Hongdae and take the first train,

679
00:54:05,369 --> 00:54:06,444
you disappear.

680
00:54:06,938 --> 00:54:08,444
The rumor already had all the answers.

681
00:54:08,739 --> 00:54:10,337
It would've been difficult to live in the house...

682
00:54:10,338 --> 00:54:11,413
where the crime was committed.

683
00:54:11,838 --> 00:54:13,783
Since they partially blamed themselves to be guilty,

684
00:54:14,139 --> 00:54:15,884
it would've been hard to tell others.

685
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:17,107
That's how they disappeared.

686
00:54:17,108 --> 00:54:18,884
Does Officer Yoo not know...

687
00:54:19,579 --> 00:54:21,424
that we used to be partners?

688
00:54:24,389 --> 00:54:27,134
We were partners when I was in Major Crimes.

689
00:54:31,228 --> 00:54:34,004
No wonder you two work well together.

690
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:35,703
What?

691
00:54:39,799 --> 00:54:42,573
Okay, then how about you? Are you two good together?

692
00:54:47,208 --> 00:54:50,323
Why did I even ask? You need to think the same...

693
00:54:50,779 --> 00:54:53,024
and be on the same level to be partners.

694
00:54:55,179 --> 00:54:56,323
Woo Hyuk.

695
00:54:57,918 --> 00:55:02,134
One person only makes trouble, and the other one resolves it.

696
00:55:02,489 --> 00:55:04,263
What should we call such a relationship?

697
00:55:06,288 --> 00:55:08,134
The one resolving it...

698
00:55:08,398 --> 00:55:10,774
must really like the troublemaker.

699
00:55:11,929 --> 00:55:12,969
What?

700
00:55:12,969 --> 00:55:16,068
There's no other reason to keep someone...

701
00:55:16,068 --> 00:55:17,743
who always makes trouble.

702
00:55:27,949 --> 00:55:29,279
The first train ghost story...

703
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:31,323
can be categorized as a serial rape case.

704
00:55:31,518 --> 00:55:34,088
Get all the documents and forward them to Major Crimes,

705
00:55:34,088 --> 00:55:36,389
then have them contact the victims to get their statements...

706
00:55:36,389 --> 00:55:37,559
before they report it.

707
00:55:37,559 --> 00:55:39,334
Wouldn't that be forwarding the case to them?

708
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:41,498
We started it, so why...

709
00:55:41,498 --> 00:55:43,674
We have other things to do,

710
00:55:44,398 --> 00:55:46,404
such as the subway serial murders.

711
00:55:47,139 --> 00:55:49,798
People disappeared between the platform and the turnstiles,

712
00:55:49,799 --> 00:55:52,283
then they were found as corpses under the train's seats.

713
00:55:52,809 --> 00:55:53,878
- You know it, don't you? - Lieutenant Ha.

714
00:55:53,878 --> 00:55:55,913
Everyone knows that case.

715
00:55:57,179 --> 00:55:59,053
You left it as a cold case for two years.

716
00:55:59,449 --> 00:56:00,854
- What? - Newbie.

717
00:56:01,648 --> 00:56:03,489
What do you mean, she "left" it?

718
00:56:03,489 --> 00:56:04,593
Let her be.

719
00:56:04,918 --> 00:56:07,064
You must have a problem with our case.

720
00:56:07,288 --> 00:56:10,203
Say it. I'll listen to it right here.

721
00:56:14,259 --> 00:56:15,374
I don't have a problem.

722
00:56:17,529 --> 00:56:18,803
But, I'll be...

723
00:56:19,469 --> 00:56:21,544
meeting all the victims for this case.

724
00:56:24,168 --> 00:56:26,084
She's just so passionate.

725
00:56:31,179 --> 00:56:34,524
Sure. If you're ignorant, you should at least be passionate.

726
00:56:35,179 --> 00:56:36,993
Go. Go and meet them.

727
00:56:40,918 --> 00:56:41,993
Madam Commissioner.

728
00:56:44,059 --> 00:56:45,334
What are you doing?

729
00:56:45,829 --> 00:56:47,628
We're investigating the first train case like you...

730
00:56:47,628 --> 00:56:51,143
Exactly. Why aren't you investigating?

731
00:56:52,969 --> 00:56:54,073
Lieutenant Ha.

732
00:56:54,639 --> 00:56:56,544
What does the Metro Detective Division do?

733
00:56:59,268 --> 00:57:02,679
When the subject of investigation influences a wide area...

734
00:57:02,679 --> 00:57:06,794
The serial rape case happened all over Seoun.

735
00:57:07,918 --> 00:57:09,254
Isn't this your case?

736
00:57:10,288 --> 00:57:13,288
That's why the Major Crimes team in charge...

737
00:57:13,288 --> 00:57:14,489
can just collect the statements for us to review.

738
00:57:14,489 --> 00:57:16,989
The hardest part of a rape case...

739
00:57:16,989 --> 00:57:19,303
is getting the victim's statement!

740
00:57:19,759 --> 00:57:22,533
Forwarding it to someone else means you won't investigate it!

741
00:57:24,529 --> 00:57:25,643
Madam Commissioner.

742
00:57:26,599 --> 00:57:29,843
Us police only have two months left.

743
00:57:30,509 --> 00:57:31,909
If we don't catch the serial murderer,

744
00:57:31,909 --> 00:57:34,783
you have to step down. It's what you promised.

745
00:57:35,038 --> 00:57:36,183
Lieutenant Ha!

746
00:57:37,079 --> 00:57:39,909
It doesn't matter if we have 2 months or 1 day.

747
00:57:39,909 --> 00:57:41,354
As long as we're in this uniform,

748
00:57:41,849 --> 00:57:45,088
we can't look away from a rape case!

749
00:57:45,088 --> 00:57:46,393
On top of that, you're in the Metro Detective Division!

750
00:57:47,088 --> 00:57:48,933
Even a mere officer is willing to do it.

751
00:57:52,929 --> 00:57:55,134
You're the officer who shot the gun, right?

752
00:57:55,858 --> 00:57:56,869
Yes, ma'am.

753
00:57:56,869 --> 00:57:58,843
I was worried you might be too rugged,

754
00:57:59,628 --> 00:58:01,113
but you're gentle at heart.

755
00:58:04,139 --> 00:58:05,444
What? Are you unhappy?

756
00:58:05,938 --> 00:58:08,013
- Do you want to catch Grasshoppers? - No, ma'am.

757
00:58:10,549 --> 00:58:12,354
Metro Detective Division will lead the case.

758
00:58:12,849 --> 00:58:15,254
Work with Subway Police to solve this case right away!

759
00:58:41,108 --> 00:58:44,683
We only have two months to catch the serial murderer and Grasshopper.

760
00:58:47,478 --> 00:58:49,354
Maybe I was trying too hard to look cool.

761
00:58:59,759 --> 00:59:02,634
I'll keep to my principles even if I die tomorrow.

762
00:59:12,108 --> 00:59:13,413
Let's switch partners.

763
00:59:18,478 --> 00:59:20,084
We're a joint investigation team now.

764
00:59:21,418 --> 00:59:24,624
If we want to share the information each team investigated,

765
00:59:24,748 --> 00:59:26,763
I think it would make sense to switch partners.

766
00:59:31,188 --> 00:59:33,834
Officer Yoo, you should be my partner.

767
00:59:34,159 --> 00:59:35,533
- Me? - Hey.

768
00:59:37,299 --> 00:59:40,044
- I'd like that. - Woo Hyuk, watch it.

769
01:00:12,429 --> 01:00:14,139
(Catch the Ghost)

770
01:00:14,139 --> 01:00:15,413
- Hold tight. - Okay!

771
01:00:15,739 --> 01:00:17,484
Speed all the way.

772
01:00:17,909 --> 01:00:20,739
The serial rape case was going to be covered up.

773
01:00:20,739 --> 01:00:22,038
I don't want to remember it.

774
01:00:22,038 --> 01:00:23,509
You're blaming me too, aren't you?

775
01:00:23,509 --> 01:00:25,783
I came because I want to help.

776
01:00:26,108 --> 01:00:27,723
Ji Seok doesn't know yet, does he?

777
01:00:27,779 --> 01:00:29,854
Why you joined the Subway Police...

778
01:00:30,389 --> 01:00:34,033
Newbie, just keep being my partner.

779
01:00:34,288 --> 01:00:37,363
Let's break up again when we get sick of each other.

780
01:00:38,059 --> 01:00:39,564
This turned out for the better.

781
01:00:40,728 --> 01:00:41,933
It's for the better.
