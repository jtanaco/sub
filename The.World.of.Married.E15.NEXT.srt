1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000


2
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:15,400
All characters, organizations, places, and events are fictional.

3
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:24,000
We had to be perfect.

4
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:28,940
“I will not get swayed no matter how hard it gets.”

5
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:32,340
I told myself that over and over again.

6
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,550
The joys of life.

7
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:43,960
The sorrows and the pain.

8
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:46,630
Happiness.

9
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:51,060
Because we should share them all...

10
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,330
since we're married.

11
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:57,940
Because he's my counterpart with whom I share my fate.

12
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:03,640
Because I shouldn't waver no matter what happens.

13
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:09,250
But now...

14
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,350
What is this woman saying?

15
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,850
Tae Oh...

16
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:20,490
slept with me.

17
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,230
I told you, didn't I?

18
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:29,770
That nothing precluded you from becoming like me.

19
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,800
Are you out of your mind?

20
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,410
Do you think I believe you?

21
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:42,350
You're trying to ruin our family before you leave.

22
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:46,280
Should I tell you what color underwear he was wearing that day?

23
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,590
I don't lie.

24
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,390
It's up to you...

25
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,930
whether or not you believe me.

26
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:00,900
You're so cheap.

27
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,200
You're a dirty harlot.

28
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,280
Aren't you ashamed to face Joon Young?

29
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:26,260
It was the night Joon Young left home and slept...

30
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,090
at the internet cafe.

31
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,090
What happened?

32
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:03,930
What about Joon Young?

33
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,270
I saw him off.

34
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,210
That's fine.

35
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,810
I'm sorry...

36
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:22,980
for causing a scene.

37
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,380
You and Dad should go.

38
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,920
We'll go after Tae Oh comes home.

39
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:31,960
Yes. We can't leave you alone.

40
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,220
I'm fine.

41
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:36,130
It's late. You should go.

42
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:40,000
You look terrible right now.

43
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:44,670
Did that woman say something strange?

44
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:47,040
This isn't the first time she acted strangely.

45
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,540
It doesn't bother me.

46
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,610
I'll just ignore her.

47
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,680
What did she say?

48
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,850
I said, nothing.

49
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,750
I want to rest.

50
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,660
Please go home. Okay?

51
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,200
{\c&HC0C0C0&}(Episode 15){\c}

52
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:18,260
I'm hungry.

53
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,000
Should we eat something?

54
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,540
Snap out of it, idiot.

55
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:04,040
So many people are hurting because of you.

56
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,010
How much more must they suffer?

57
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,990
You piece of trash.

58
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:09,240
Sorry.

59
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,290
Where's Joon Young?

60
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:47,980
Where's...

61
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,250
Where's Joon Young?

62
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,560
What happened?

63
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,330
Did you sleep with her?

64
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,400
With Sun Woo.

65
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:13,440
Did you sleep with her?

66
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,910
Answer wisely...

67
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:23,480
if you don't want to repeat the same mistake twice.

68
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,320
Everything...

69
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,620
depends on your answer.

70
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:35,190
Will you tell the truth or lie to me?

71
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:40,500
If you tell the truth, I will resent you for the rest of my life,

72
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:43,070
but if you lie,

73
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,270
I'll never forgive you.

74
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,580
But, I can't forgive lies.

75
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:54,080
Lying would be truly betraying me.

76
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,380
So be honest with me.

77
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:58,420
Are you seeing another woman?

78
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:02,220
You choose which would be worse.

79
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,830
I heard it was the night Joon Young left home.

80
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:13,630
The night I was up all night because Jenny had a fever.

81
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,100
The night you lied to me, saying you were with Je Hyuk!

82
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:19,900
I called countless times because our baby was sick,

83
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,240
but you were doing that with that woman?

84
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:30,720
- Did Sun Woo say that?

85
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,450
Did you sleep with her?

86
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,290
Did you?

87
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,130
Yes.

88
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,360
What's the deal with you two?

89
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:19,900
It was...

90
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,100
a mistake.

91
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,770
It meant nothing to me. It was just a mistake.

92
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:31,210
That's all. Nothing more.

93
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,550
It was a mistake I never want to make again.

94
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:40,380
She won't be here anymore.

95
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,590
She's leaving.

96
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,550
She handed in her resignation already.

97
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:46,260
Stop letting her bother you, Da Kyung.

98
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,090
Who cares where she is...

99
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:49,930
when it's you I can't trust!

100
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,830
I trusted you...

101
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:58,270
when she said you were stalking her.

102
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:01,610
Even when I saw your phone full of her pictures,

103
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:02,870
I still trusted you.

104
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:05,910
When she became your alibi at the police station,

105
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:06,940
I thought...

106
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,920
she did it because you're her son's dad.

107
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,620
I thought she did it for Joon Young.

108
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,490
But I get it now.

109
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:23,730
You two are still attached to each other.

110
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:27,470
You, and that woman too.

111
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,440
All that woman cares about is ruining me.

112
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:42,710
Why would she share such an embarrassing thing with you?

113
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:45,020
She's trying to break us apart!

114
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,690
Don't let her words mislead you.

115
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,520
You're the only one I want to protect.

116
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:55,490
I tried to make her leave because I want to be happy with you.

117
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:56,990
And finally, it's happening!

118
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,360
Is that why you slept with her?

119
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,200
To make her leave town?

120
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,770
Do you expect me to believe that?

121
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:50,470
We loved, married,

122
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:53,040
and raised you together.

123
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:58,980
The person I spent the most of my life with...

124
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,550
is your dad.

125
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,290
We fought terribly...

126
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:10,690
and parted ways because we couldn't live together anymore,

127
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,870
but it wasn't just hatred we had for each other.

128
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:21,640
Just like how you missed him,

129
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,810
I missed my husband too,

130
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,120
although it was only for a short moment.

131
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:42,230
It's normal to feel confused and betrayed.

132
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,800
I'm so sorry.

133
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:53,400
I'm okay with it even if you continue to hate me.

134
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:58,240
I'll still remain by your side to support and protect you.

135
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:04,010
What I want...

136
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,320
is for you to cherish yourself. That's all.

137
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:11,390
You're different from your parents.

138
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,820
You can live differently.

139
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:17,800
Just remember that,

140
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:20,200
okay?

141
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,930
I'm sure the whole school knows...

142
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:27,300
that I'm a thief.

143
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:31,080
It'll be tough,

144
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:35,350
but you can fight through it. You have me.

145
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,880
I'll protect you by your side.

146
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:44,520
Let's get through this together, okay?

147
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:51,230
Can't we just leave?

148
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,130
Let's go somewhere no one knows us.

149
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:59,740
Are you okay with never seeing your dad again?

150
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,110
Yes.

151
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,620
I don't want to see him ever again.

152
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,230
Okay.

153
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,360
Let's go, wherever it is.

154
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,030
Give me just a few days to get things organized.

155
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:31,940
Okay?

156

{\c&HC0C0C0&\b1}(A World of Married Couple){\b\c}

157
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,370
Thank you for telling me the truth.

158
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,510
I bet it wasn't easy.

159
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:24,180
Does Joon Young know what happened...

160
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,880
between the two of you?

161
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:35,930
I feel sorry for him.

162
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:44,540
I won't let...

Jenny become like Joon Young.

164
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,410
I'm not like that woman.

165
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:55,950
I don't want to act crazy and hit rock bottom.

166

I know I can overcome this.

167
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,090
I'll make sure to overcome it even if just for Jenny.

168

I'll get through it...

But give me some time.

172
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:28,080
- I need time.

173
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:30,850
Take as much as you need.

174
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:34,420
Take your time.

175
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:36,990
I'll wait.

176
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,990
Also, I'll try my best too.

177
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:48,600
Eat your breakfast.

178
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:06,650
Thank you.

179
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,330
The soup is delicious.

180
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:22,930
Good.

181
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:25,770
Enjoy it.

182
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,890
I'm going to check up on Jenny.

183
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,290
Okay.

184
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:02,070
Come here.

185
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,450
Jenny.

186
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:15,690
I'll see you after work.

187
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,590
I'll see you.

188
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:24,230
Okay.

189
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:25,360
I don't want to meet him.

190
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:45,640
Stay in your room.

191
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,320
Where's Joon Young?

192
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:56,920
Tell me what you need to say. I'll make sure to let him know.

193
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:59,660
I'm here to apologize. I want to do it face to face.

194
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:01,830
He doesn't want to see you.

195
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:05,500
Joon Young.

196
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,260
Joon Young!

197
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:09,830
What are you doing? I said he doesn't want to see you.

198
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:11,640
Joon Young!

199
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,940
Just leave!

200
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,670
He doesn't want to meet you. He doesn't even want to talk to you.

201
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:15,910
He's scared of you right now.

202
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:23,050
I'm sorry.

203
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,750
I'm sorry I hit you.

204
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:28,820
I apologize.

205
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:31,090
Can we please talk?

206
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,160
I didn't hit you out of hatred.

207
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,430
- I was just really angry...

208
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,700
Let's at least clear the air between us.

209
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,300
Don't you want to do that?

210
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,200
If you don't leave, I'm going to call the cops.

211
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:07,160
You should go now. Stop bothering him.

212
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:16,670
It's over now! Just go!

213
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:40,090
- Was everything part of your plan?

214
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:44,190
- What are you talking about?

215
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,630
You said we should keep it a secret! You said that yourself!

216
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:49,970
Do you still have feelings for me?

217
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:51,640
I did what you asked.

218
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,470
I gave up everything and backed down.

219
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:57,940
All I asked of you was to make sure Joon Young didn't get hurt.

220
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,940
You promised to raise him well.

221
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,510
You said you'll make him happy.

222
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,020
But how dare you hit my son in front of her and her family?

223
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,120
So what?

224
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,460
Did you tell her to get back at me?

225
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,730
Do you really want to take this even further?

226
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:18,700
Are you scared she might leave you?

227
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:24,270
Da Kyung is nothing like you.

228
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:27,000
She's willing to forgive me for the mistake I made.

229
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,040
Too bad, right? You must be disappointed.

230
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,310
Do you really think...

231
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:36,350
she'll be able to forgive you?

232
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,780
Do you really think...

233
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:43,850
she'll be any different?

234
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,290
Don't even think for a second that Joon Young likes you.

235
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:52,260
He's just being like that because he's angry at me.

236
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,370
I'm never going to give him up.

237
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,040
This is your last warning.

238
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:09,910
Give up on Joon Young and end the fight here and now.

239
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:12,750
Otherwise, I won't stay still.

240
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:15,450
I swear I will put an end to you.

241
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:17,550
I will completely destroy your life.

242
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,060
No, you just destroyed your own life.

243
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,630
You tried to get back at me with that one-night mistake,

244
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:25,730
but you only got humiliated.

245
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,530
Do you still not know your place?

246
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,470
What can you do to me?

247
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:30,970
What are you going to do?

248
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:36,470
I will never let an insane woman like you raise Joon Young.

249
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,110
I'm going to take him back as soon as possible.

250
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,740
So keep that in mind.

251
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,050
What if Dad comes back?

252
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:18,950
What if he tries to take me away?

253
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:23,750
Don't worry. Your dad will never be able to bother you again.

254
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,190
I told you I'll protect you.

255
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,440
Can I help you?

256
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:19,010
Tell Chairman Yeo...

257
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:23,750
that I'd like to meet him.

258
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,670
How long are you going to keep a tail on me?

259
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:32,340
Or did you put a tail Tae Oh?

260
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:35,580
I'm sure I made myself clear that I'll do anything...

261
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,610
to make sure my daughter is happy.

262
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:43,680
I guess that means you finally admit that your daughter is unhappy.

263
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:49,060
What did you say to my daughter last night?

264
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:52,560
You mean you want to know what happened...

265
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:56,730
between me and Tae Oh.

266
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:02,570
I knew a long time ago that you didn't trust Tae Oh.

267
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,240
So I'm sure you can already guess what happened.

268
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:13,680
What was...

269
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:18,350
Da Kyung's dream?

270
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:26,830
My daughter...

271
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:32,600
liked to travel ever since she was young.

272
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:34,970
So I took her to many different places.

273
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,710
She especially enjoyed going to art galleries.

274
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:46,410
Come to think of it, it was nice then.

275
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:51,520
She had said she wanted to gain more experience and develop...

276
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:53,850
a better eye for art,

277
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:57,820
and then operate an art gallery.

278
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,360
You are...

279
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:03,860
more than capable of making that come true if she wanted.

280
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:06,970
Naturally.

281
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,370
She could've lived up to her potential and lived freely.

282
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:16,940
She was held back unexpectedly by Tae Oh.

283
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:25,050
Your precious daughter is wasting her youth...

284
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,150
because of a man.

285
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:30,460
Isn't that tragic?

286
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:36,030
Seeing her struggling with her second-wife complex...

287
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:38,670
makes me pity her...

288
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:41,370
as a fellow woman.

289
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:49,910
That's why I came here today, knowing I'm not welcome.

290
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,810
Since you'd do anything...

291
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:59,520
for your daughter.

292
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,290
Da Kyung, it's Mom.

293
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,760
- Are you okay?

294
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,760
Of course, I'm okay. Everything's fine.

295
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,300
Why did you call?

296
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:48,100
I think Ji Sun Woo really did leave.

297
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:51,870
The real estate agent said her house is up for sale.

298
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,770
She packed up her things and left with her kid,

299
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,440
so you don't have to worry anymore.

300
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,300
Are we doing the right thing?

301
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,580
Where are you moving to?

302
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:43,660
Return them to the kids.

303
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:53,100
Tell them I'm sorry...

304
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,940
for me.

305
00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:00,540
I'm sorry to you too.

306
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:09,180
Sorry for asking you to do this.

307
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,780
Joon Young.

308
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,960
It was because I liked you.

309
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:19,990
Because I was worried.

310
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,700
It was because I wished you'd stop.

311
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,270
I wasn't being holier-than-thou.

312
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,070
So...

313
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,310
I'm sorry if I offended you.

314
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:35,580
I'm sorry too.

315
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:43,280
Thanks.

316
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:14,380
Shall we go?

317
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:16,620
Okay.

318
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,600
It's empty.

319
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:14,640
- Hello.

320
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,410
Many of Dr. Ji's patients left,

321
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:18,950
so it's a bit empty.

322
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:22,320
Did Dr. Ji say when she's coming back?

323
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:24,650
No.

324
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:28,550
Dr. Sul says she thinks she left.

325
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:30,920
She left? Completely?

326
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,060
{\c&H80FFFF&}(Tae Oh){\c}

327
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,630
What happened between you guys?

328
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:36,160
Sun Woo said she and Joon Young left.

329
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,560
Is that true?

330
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,300
{\c&H80FFFF&}(Sun Woo said she and Joon Young left. Is that true?){\c}

331
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:47,970
I'm sure you thought hard about it before making your decision.

332
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:50,910
I just...

333
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:55,950
want you to be happy.

334
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:59,520
I wanted to tell you that.

335
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:12,470
Your message has been saved.

336
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:27,580
It's strong and sturdy.

337
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,550
It was maintained nicely too. Come in.

338
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:36,120
The owner left very suddenly,

339
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:39,530
so the furniture is still here.

340
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:41,630
Take a slow look around.

341
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:44,400
Okay.

342
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,080
Are you with the real estate agency?

343
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,190
Is someone looking at the house?

344
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:16,620
Yes. She's looking upstairs.

345
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:20,830
When do you think our house will sell?

346
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:24,360
I can't say. The market has been slow lately.

347
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:28,170
It's not like we can drop the price that much. I'm worried.

348
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:30,570
I'm sure there will be a buyer soon.

349
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:34,140
Every house has an owner meant for it.

350
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,940
Da Kyung?

351
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,620
What brings you here?

352
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,550
Do you know each other?

353
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:50,660
Do you mind if we chat? You can go ahead.

354
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:52,290
Sure.

355
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:57,900
Think it over and give me a call.

356
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,970
Sun Woo gave me a key and asked me to pack up her things.

357
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,610
I didn't expect to see you here.

358
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,350
I just wanted to confirm that she really did leave.

359
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,780
That isn't all...

360
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,190
that you want to confirm.

361
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:24,360
Aren't you anxious because you're not sure if it's really over...

362
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,030
between them?

363
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:31,760
I understand. I'd be the same way.

364
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:36,000
I'll let you get to work.

365
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:38,640
Tae Oh won't...

366
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,970
get over Sun Woo so easily.

367
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:49,280
Sun Woo ran away like she did because she knows this.

368
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,950
On what grounds are you making such claims?

369
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:57,120
Did Sun Woo tell you to say this to me?

370
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,660
I guess she did.

371
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:05,730
I thought so.

372
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:08,670
Je Hyuk said this to me.

373
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:12,940
Even when a man has a woman beside him,

374
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:15,610
he won't be able to get over his previous love.

375
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,580
He thinks Tae Oh is like that.

376
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:21,950
You know Sun Woo went into hiding once, right?

377
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,280
Tae Oh came to see me then.

378
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:27,490
He asked me if I could check on her well-being for him.

379
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,660
His eyes looked so desperate.

380
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:35,590
Why do you think Tae Oh acted that way?

381
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:42,200
I know very well how torturous it is to live...

382
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:46,570
while doubting your husband.

383
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:52,240
That's why I wanted to tell you as another woman...

384
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:54,810
and as someone with experience.

385
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:03,360
If you don't believe me, you can come to my house.

386
00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:05,190
I'll show you some security footage.

387
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:09,760
She forwarded me her login for the security company.

388
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,930
You'll be able to see how often Tae Oh came...

389
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:18,870
and how many times he wandered around the empty house.

390
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:40,790
- Thank you.

391
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:35,410
Let's consider this a trip.

392
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:41,250
Let's not think about anything for a while and just relax.

393
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:44,460
I feel strange.

394
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:50,600
It's because the place is unfamiliar.

395
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:52,300
You'll get used to it soon.

396
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,770
Don't worry about anything and just have positive thoughts.

397
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:59,710
Just choose where you want to go and what you want to do.

398
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:01,170
I'll do everything for you.

399
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,250
We can even go back if you want to.

400
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:30,700
I wrapped up all the urgent projects at work.

401
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,670
Should we go on a trip?

402
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:35,210
Where to?

403
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:37,740
You shouldn't overwork yourself,

404
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:40,050
so how about somewhere warm to recuperate?

405
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:42,180
Maybe Bali or Hawaii?

406
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,180
How's Hawaii?

407
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:47,190
Okay.

408
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:50,960
I can go anytime, so you should pick the dates that work for you.

409
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,260
Great.

410
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:45,280
I'm sorry.

411
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:48,580
Can I...

412
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:51,920
sleepover tonight?

413
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:01,660
Another time.

414
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:10,140
I'm sorry. I went too far.

415
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:13,610
I'm so bad at reading the mood.

416
00:45:15,070 --> 00:45:16,140
Gosh.

417
00:45:20,410 --> 00:45:21,650
I didn't upset you, did I?

418
00:46:22,610 --> 00:46:25,240
- I'm home.

419
00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:30,380
Where's Jenny?

420
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,050
She's asleep.

421
00:46:39,790 --> 00:46:41,130
Nothing happened, right?

422
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,060
No.

423
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:49,170
I'm going to make some ramyeon. Do you want to eat with me?

424
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:51,000
I'm okay.

425
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:52,700
Okay, then.

426
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,340
Thank you.

427
00:48:31,570 --> 00:48:33,510
Do you really not care where we go?

428
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,940
Every school is the same.

429
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:41,380
Your hospital is more important.

430
00:48:44,350 --> 00:48:46,450
Should we look for a place in Seoul while we're at it?

431
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:50,090
We should think about your university too.

432
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,230
You should meet someone else too.

433
00:48:56,090 --> 00:48:57,600
You should date someone nice.

434
00:48:58,430 --> 00:48:59,670
I'm okay with it.

435
00:49:05,070 --> 00:49:07,370
Why did you dislike Dr. Kim Yoon Ki?

436
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:08,840
Because you were too good for him.

437
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,740
- What?

438
00:49:12,510 --> 00:49:13,610
He's not good enough for you.

439
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:27,690
How's Joon Young doing?

440
00:49:27,690 --> 00:49:28,830
{\c&H80FFFF&}(How's Joon Young doing?){\c}

441
00:49:28,830 --> 00:49:30,100
Are you doing well?

442
00:49:44,210 --> 00:49:45,680
{\c&H80FFFF&}(Ji Sun Woo){\c}

443
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:51,620
Hello?

444
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:53,990
I'm sorry.

445
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:56,560
I left without saying goodbye.

446
00:49:58,590 --> 00:50:01,030
I know I shouldn't feel this way.

447
00:50:01,030 --> 00:50:02,590
But I can't stop worrying about you.

448
00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:05,400
Is everything okay?

449
00:50:05,630 --> 00:50:08,970
Joon Young and I are planning the future.

450
00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:12,970
He's a lot calmer.

451
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:16,070
We even laughed together.

452
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:21,880
The kids told me they understand and that you don't need to be sorry.

453
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:24,580
Can't you just stay?

454
00:50:28,350 --> 00:50:30,120
Enough about Joon Young. What about you?

455
00:50:32,590 --> 00:50:34,230
Are you doing okay?

456
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:41,170
The air is nice here.

457
00:50:42,130 --> 00:50:43,900
The stars are so vivid.

458
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:49,610
And thanks to that,

459
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:53,480
things have become a lot clearer now.

460
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:58,580
Thank you, Dr. Kim.

461
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:01,490
I won't forget how much you helped.

462
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:03,460
Dr. Ji.

463
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,930
Can you tell me once you decide...

464
00:51:09,730 --> 00:51:10,860
where you're going to go?

465
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,180
{\c&H80FFFF&}(Yeo Da Kyung){\c}

466
00:52:29,510 --> 00:52:30,680
What do you want?

467
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:24,240
I'll convince Tae Oh...

468
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:28,120
and make him give up his parental rights for Joon Young.

469
00:53:29,990 --> 00:53:33,320
So don't expect to get any child-rearing expenses.

470
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:39,120
When did I ever ask for that?

471
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:41,930
It's because you might use that as an excuse to show up before him.

472
00:53:45,010 --> 00:53:47,240
Make sure you guys won't ever have to meet again...

473
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:51,300
because of Joon Young.

474
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:58,490
You know very well that Joon Young was just an excuse.

475
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:01,280
That's why you came all the way here.

476
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:05,950
It was just a one-night mistake.

477
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:10,570
And I'm going to believe that.

478
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:16,740
If you don't want to get humiliated, just promise me...

479
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:18,700
that you'll never show up before us again.

480
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:21,240
If you don't,

481
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:25,200
I'll just sue you for having committed adultery.

482
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:28,510
I have nothing more to fear. You think I won't be able to do it?

483
00:54:36,990 --> 00:54:39,450
What is it that you want to protect?

484
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:42,300
Tae Oh?

485
00:54:43,090 --> 00:54:46,760
Your family? Or your pride?

486
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,740
Will your anxiety subside...

487
00:54:53,010 --> 00:54:54,970
if I promise not to show up?

488
00:54:55,030 --> 00:54:57,110
That's none of your business.

489
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:00,970
You're right. It's your right to choose.

490
00:55:03,450 --> 00:55:05,410
And that's none of my business.

491
00:55:09,050 --> 00:55:11,390
But before you choose, there's something you need to know.

492
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:18,890
What are you doing?

493
00:55:19,490 --> 00:55:20,660
I'm going to show you...

494
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:24,340
Tae Oh's true nature.

495
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:36,470
This used to be my favorite song.

496
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:39,490
And because of that, Tae Oh liked it, too.

497
00:55:40,910 --> 00:55:44,450
This isn't just our favorite song. There's a special meaning to it.

498
00:55:46,930 --> 00:55:48,550
He proposed to me...

499
00:55:51,030 --> 00:55:52,800
with this song playing in the background.

500
00:55:58,110 --> 00:55:59,700
"Let's get married, Sun Woo."

501
00:56:00,530 --> 00:56:05,010
"I promise I'll make you and our baby happy."

502
00:56:06,110 --> 00:56:08,620
"I'm not doing this because you're pregnant."

503
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:13,450
"It's because I love you, Sun Woo."

504
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:19,050
"I want to share my life with you."

505
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:20,660
"Let's live together."

506
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:29,990
Did he say something similar to you?

507
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:35,930
Did he tell you you're his one and only love?

508
00:56:39,870 --> 00:56:41,840
Did he whisper words of love?

509
00:56:42,970 --> 00:56:44,340
Don't lie to me.

510
00:56:49,050 --> 00:56:50,720
You have no proof.

511
00:56:58,470 --> 00:57:02,200
Follow me. I'll prove to you that I'm not lying.

512
00:57:03,430 --> 00:57:04,660
Where are you taking me?

513
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:10,300
To my house.

514
00:57:48,550 --> 00:57:49,970
What about that?

515
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:52,990
I was shocked when I first saw the resemblance.

516
00:57:54,890 --> 00:57:56,090
Don't you get it?

517
00:57:57,050 --> 00:57:58,160
Look carefully.

518
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:03,050
I saw everything in your bedroom when I went to your place.

519
00:58:05,370 --> 00:58:07,200
We had the same perfume.

520
00:58:09,090 --> 00:58:11,110
The same kind of underwear.

521
00:58:12,910 --> 00:58:14,740
And even wore the same type of wedding dress.

522
00:58:16,510 --> 00:58:18,740
They were all the same, and it completely creeped me out.

523
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:21,820
Did Tae Oh pick them out for you?

524
00:58:23,450 --> 00:58:24,550
Or...

525
00:58:25,450 --> 00:58:26,950
did you pick them yourself?

526
00:58:31,450 --> 00:58:34,550
You went through my stuff and bought the same things.

527
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:38,090
How much worse can you get?

528
00:58:38,090 --> 00:58:39,390
Don't you think you're being immature?

529
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:09,090
I don't have irrefutable evidence that you want.

530
00:59:14,030 --> 00:59:15,090
However,

531
00:59:16,590 --> 00:59:17,740
I don't lie.

532
00:59:22,970 --> 00:59:25,050
I don't know whether or not Tae Oh is conscious of it,

533
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:28,280
but you...

534
00:59:30,450 --> 00:59:31,950
are a lot like me.

535
00:59:34,050 --> 00:59:35,260
What do you think?

536
00:59:47,870 --> 00:59:49,090
Many people dress like that.

537
00:59:49,370 --> 00:59:50,910
Don't try to force it.

538
00:59:50,910 --> 00:59:52,370
He's meticulous and detail-oriented, right?

539
00:59:53,110 --> 00:59:55,070
Everything must go according to plan.

540
00:59:56,370 --> 00:59:57,680
You probably thought...

541
00:59:58,110 --> 01:00:00,680
he was free-spirited, and that drew you to him.

542
01:00:01,820 --> 01:00:04,640
He probably fell for you,

543
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:07,280
who looked up to him and provided for him.

544
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:11,720
You and I are the type that he's instinctively drawn to.

545
01:00:18,390 --> 01:00:22,070
Are you trying to insist that he's still into you?

546
01:00:24,510 --> 01:00:27,430
Why am I listening to your delusions?

547
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:30,800
What if a woman like that appears again?

548
01:00:33,950 --> 01:00:37,340
You're right. It's a common look.

549
01:00:39,910 --> 01:00:42,760
There are plenty of women like us.

550
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:48,300
Sadly, Tae Oh is a free spirit.

551
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:53,760
He is drawn to the woman who takes good care of him,

552
01:00:54,570 --> 01:00:57,030
but once he feels like he is being stifled,

553
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:59,610
he'll look for a place to breathe.

554
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:02,240
Just as he fell for you...

555
01:01:03,430 --> 01:01:04,700
while he was with me.

556
01:01:09,550 --> 01:01:10,840
I'm sure by the time...

557
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:15,620
Jenny is Joon Young's age.

558
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:20,720
Can you guarantee that won't happen?

559
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:14,950
That's how useless it is.

560
01:02:16,620 --> 01:02:19,510
That's all that supposedly great love amounts to.

561
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:25,590
What is marriage?

562
01:02:28,430 --> 01:02:29,990
You're blinded briefly...

563
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:34,030
by the misconception that it's fate and get married.

564
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:36,890
Is it worth giving your all as collateral...

565
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:42,110
just because you lived together for a few years?

566
01:02:47,450 --> 01:02:49,280
Knowing you'll be miserable.

567
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:55,990
I still don't get it.

568
01:03:00,550 --> 01:03:01,950
One thing is for sure.

569
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:07,470
You can't raise a child with a man you know will hurt you.

570
01:03:09,370 --> 01:03:10,840
Think it over.

571
01:03:12,570 --> 01:03:14,430
It may be your last chance...

572
01:03:15,910 --> 01:03:17,280
to escape.

The investor I'm meeting with today really liked the manuscript.

I have a good feeling about this.

Sounds good.

It keeps getting declined.

Sorry about last time.

What brings you here?

600
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:21,510
I was meeting an investor.

601
01:07:23,250 --> 01:07:26,580
Are sponsorship talks going well with the chairman?

602
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:31,960
Chairman Yeo flaked on that promise ages ago.

603
01:07:32,670 --> 01:07:33,790
Didn't you know?

604
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:37,830
Why? Did something happen?

605
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:39,500
You should know better than I do.

606
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:43,710
- Sir? Sir.

607
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:45,410
This card won't work either.

608
01:07:47,510 --> 01:07:48,640
Okay, then.

609
01:08:12,110 --> 01:08:13,330
Mr. Lee!

610
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:20,750
Where's Mr. Lee?

01:08:31,530 --> 01:08:32,660
What are you doing?

What do you think you're doing?

613
01:08:42,070 --> 01:08:43,830
Why were the corporate cards canceled?

614
01:08:44,130 --> 01:08:46,000
I was told by the chairman...

615
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:47,910
to close everything and kick you out.

616
01:08:47,910 --> 01:08:48,970
What?

617
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:51,610
What nonsense are you talking about?

618
01:08:51,610 --> 01:08:53,910
I finally found an investor and we're about to sign!

619
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:56,950
If I leave, who's going to take over?

620
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:58,450
I told you, it's over for you.

Are you crazy?

622

Who are you to tell me that?

623
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:06,460
If you want to see your daughter for the last time,

"Documents"? What documents?

643
01:10:34,170 --> 01:10:35,280
Divorce documents!

Father, why are you suddenly acting like this?

648
01:10:47,790 --> 01:10:49,290
There must be a misunderstanding.

649
01:10:49,290 --> 01:10:50,530
I'm not your father!

- Father.

The only thing I wanted from you...

But unfortunately,

660

01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,580
Don't bother with him and get in the car.

670
01:12:11,170 --> 01:12:12,610
I'll take care of it.

671
01:12:13,610 --> 01:12:15,250
You should wait in the car.

672
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:19,950
I thought you said you'd forgive me.

673
01:12:21,050 --> 01:12:22,320
We decided to work on it together.

674
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:24,120
Why would you suddenly do this?

675
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:26,460
That's when you made just one mistake.

676
01:12:28,390 --> 01:12:30,860
But that wasn't the case.

677
01:12:32,390 --> 01:12:35,130
I won't be fooled again. It's over.

678
01:12:38,210 --> 01:12:39,760
There's no need to listen to everything your father says.

679
01:12:40,370 --> 01:12:42,130
Let's take care of our problem on our own.

680
01:12:42,130 --> 01:12:43,740
Dad knew everything!

681
01:12:45,210 --> 01:12:47,920
He was preparing for everything because he was worried about me.

682
01:12:49,510 --> 01:12:52,510
I feel sorry for Jenny who has you as her dad,

683
01:12:53,950 --> 01:12:55,380
but it's a hundred times better not to have you around.

684
01:12:56,620 --> 01:12:57,960
Don't you ever think about seeing her again.

685
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:02,660
You're all I have.

686
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:09,540
I love you, Da Kyung. Please.

687
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:12,300
The song you used to propose to me...

688
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:17,880
was used on that woman too.

689
01:13:19,670 --> 01:13:22,120
The perfume you bought for me was the one she used too,

690
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:23,820
as well as my underwear, wedding dress, and everything else.

691
01:13:28,290 --> 01:13:29,620
Who am I to you?

692
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:35,550
What was I to you?

693
01:13:36,750 --> 01:13:38,290
What are you talking about?

694
01:13:38,460 --> 01:13:40,760
The delusional one wasn't that woman.

695
01:13:44,070 --> 01:13:45,170
It was me.

696
01:13:47,740 --> 01:13:49,800
I found out everything.

697
01:13:50,830 --> 01:13:52,210
To you,

698
01:13:54,970 --> 01:13:57,420
I was just a substitute for Ji Sun Woo.

699
01:14:02,250 --> 01:14:03,580
Go to that woman.

700
01:14:17,170 --> 01:14:19,070
Da Kyung. Wait.

701
01:14:19,430 --> 01:14:21,430
Jenny! Jenny, wait!

702
01:14:22,830 --> 01:14:25,000
Da Kyung, let me talk to Jenny for a minute.

703
01:14:25,170 --> 01:14:27,340
Da Kyung! Let me talk to Jenny!

704
01:16:20,010 --> 01:16:21,080
Get out!

705
01:16:22,420 --> 01:16:23,580
I said, get out!

706
01:16:28,490 --> 01:16:29,790
It's all your fault.

707
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:32,030
I lost everything because of you!

708
01:16:32,490 --> 01:16:35,860
Did you plan everything to ruin me?

709
01:16:39,370 --> 01:16:42,770
What did you say to Da Kyung?

710
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:08,530
The house, money,

711
01:17:10,930 --> 01:17:12,130
and my family too...

712
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:19,740
I'm left with nothing.

713
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:05,620
{\c&H80FFFF&}(Son){\c}

714
01:18:08,690 --> 01:18:09,790
Hey, Mom.

715
01:18:10,820 --> 01:18:12,460
I took care of everything.

716
01:18:13,090 --> 01:18:15,200
I'll be right there. Wait there until I arrive.

717
01:18:19,830 --> 01:18:20,970
What about Dad?

718
01:18:22,700 --> 01:18:24,170
Did you settle everything with him?

719
01:20:13,950 --> 01:20:16,220
Use this money to get yourself a motel room or something.

720
01:20:17,020 --> 01:20:19,050
And think about what you're going to do now.

721
01:20:20,490 --> 01:20:21,760
Let me know once you come up with a plan.

722
01:20:23,820 --> 01:20:25,660
I'll help you rent a studio.

723
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:31,330
You're a monster.

724
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:37,600
I never should've met you.

725
01:20:38,710 --> 01:20:40,570
You ruined my life.

726
01:20:42,580 --> 01:20:44,180
You should've just killed me.

727
01:20:45,910 --> 01:20:47,650
That would've been better for both of us.

728
01:20:48,420 --> 01:20:49,980
Will you please get to your senses?

729
01:20:51,990 --> 01:20:53,820
Think of all the things you've done...

730
01:20:54,250 --> 01:20:56,120
before trying to blame others.

731
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:58,560
You're the one who ruined your life, not me.

732
01:20:59,260 --> 01:21:00,560
Do you still not get it?

733
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,200
Joon Young knows everything.

734
01:21:05,270 --> 01:21:06,330
Knows what?

735
01:21:06,870 --> 01:21:08,400
He knows why I hit you.

736
01:21:09,100 --> 01:21:10,740
Joon Young knows everything.

737
01:21:13,610 --> 01:21:16,710
Joon Young hates you. No, he loathes you.

738
01:21:18,280 --> 01:21:20,680
He knows how monstrous you are.

739
01:21:21,750 --> 01:21:24,150
He can never be happy with you.

740
01:21:31,890 --> 01:21:33,930
You might be able to abandon me, but not Joon Young!

741
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:37,100
I'm going to meet him...

742
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:40,130
and tell him exactly what you did to me today.

743
01:21:41,330 --> 01:21:44,000
I'll tell him how you completely destroyed my life.

744
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,510
He deserves to know that, doesn't he?

745
01:23:51,330 --> 01:23:54,370
My goodness, did you receive a private lesson?

746
01:23:54,370 --> 01:23:58,200
- What are you talking about?

747
01:23:58,540 --> 01:23:59,670
My goodness.

748
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:02,710
It's nice to be outside.

749
01:24:04,210 --> 01:24:06,250
I heard the land where the film set was going to be built...

750
01:24:06,250 --> 01:24:07,650
is going to be sold at a very low price.

751
01:24:08,250 --> 01:24:11,520
I guess Chairman Yeo and his family aren't planning to come back.

752
01:24:14,020 --> 01:24:16,190
My husband also thinks the same way.

753
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:20,290
But it looks like Dr. Ji is back.

754
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:23,230
Mr. Lee was forced to get a divorce and got kicked out.

755
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:25,830
Chairman Yeo and his family left Gosan.

756
01:24:26,070 --> 01:24:28,330
And now, Ji Sun Woo comes back like she had it all planned.

757
01:24:28,740 --> 01:24:29,900
Doesn't it seem like...

758
01:24:30,940 --> 01:24:33,370
something happened between them?

759
01:24:33,370 --> 01:24:37,340
There are rumors saying Dr. Ji was the one who got them divorced.

760
01:24:38,110 --> 01:24:40,450
Every married couple has a story we don't know about.

761
01:24:40,510 --> 01:24:42,750
Don't get yourselves in trouble...

762
01:24:42,850 --> 01:24:45,150
for talking about other people's families. Be careful.

763
01:24:46,390 --> 01:24:50,420
By the way, what's the director's plan?

764
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:52,260
The chairperson seems pretty stern about it.

765
01:24:53,060 --> 01:24:55,530
And my husband also thinks it's hard to find someone like her.

766
01:24:55,630 --> 01:24:57,430
So he's going to do his best to bring her back.

767
01:24:58,400 --> 01:24:59,670
That's good.

Yes, I know.

01:25:46,950 --> 01:25:47,980
Bye.

01:25:59,260 --> 01:26:02,860
How nice. Congratulations on becoming the associate director.

780
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:06,770
When are you going to start working here again?

781
01:26:07,900 --> 01:26:10,870
I asked you to come because the director asked me to.

782
01:26:10,870 --> 01:26:12,140
I'm supposed to convince you.

783
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:14,740
He knows you've been back for quite a while...

784
01:26:14,740 --> 01:26:16,640
and thinks you should hurry up and come back to work.

785
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:21,580
He's very nervous that you might end up...

786
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:23,220
working at another hospital.

787
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:26,350
Do you think it's a good idea?

788
01:26:26,750 --> 01:26:28,150
I feel too ashamed to come back here.

789
01:26:28,150 --> 01:26:30,120
Don't worry and start working here again.

790
01:26:31,590 --> 01:26:33,590
We left your office empty all along.

791
01:26:34,190 --> 01:26:36,700
Stop making the director feel so anxious.

792
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:39,870
Thank you.

793
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:47,670
By the way, about Tae Oh...

794
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:51,740
I don't think he left for good.

795
01:26:52,150 --> 01:26:53,550
Remember Woo Ho Sang?

796
01:26:53,950 --> 01:26:55,450
My high school friend you met last time.

797
01:26:56,450 --> 01:26:58,350
He told me he saw Tae Oh pretty recently.

798
01:27:00,490 --> 01:27:02,520
- Where?

799
01:27:03,490 --> 01:27:05,390
He looked all haggard...

800
01:27:05,730 --> 01:27:08,260
and was fighting a street bar owner for not having paid properly.

801
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:13,030
My friend felt bad for him, so he offered to pay instead.

802
01:27:13,830 --> 01:27:15,970
But once he looked back, he was already gone.

803
01:27:18,740 --> 01:27:19,910
When was that?

804
01:27:21,810 --> 01:27:24,140
About a week ago.

805
01:27:27,110 --> 01:27:30,020
Why don't you look for him?

806
01:27:31,150 --> 01:27:34,590
I'm worried he might get himself in trouble.

Why should I?

808
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:39,460
He's probably thinking clearer now.

Okay.

Let's do it before it's too late.

It's so easy. Why did we push it off?

Are you still mad...

because I said no once?

You don't have to say anything.

Let's just stay like this for a little while.

Have you heard from Tae Oh?

I'm sure he won't show up again.

You were always the only one for me.

You ruined everything, Dad.

The truth is,

832
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:06,960
Je Hyuk said he thought he saw Tae Oh recently.
