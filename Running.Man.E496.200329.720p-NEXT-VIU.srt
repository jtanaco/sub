306
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:28,093
<b>I don't know why everyone tries to keep me at a distance.</b>

307
00:10:28,609 --> 00:10:30,280
<b>All right. The end.</b>

308
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,593
<b>(So Min makes everyone keep her at a distance.)</b>

309
00:10:31,709 --> 00:10:35,490
<b>Seong Wu is back after a long time. It's been a long time, right?</b>

310
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:38,959
<b>Yes. I haven't been on a TV show for a long time.</b>

311
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,858
<b>I know. You haven't been on TV shows for a while.</b>

312
00:10:40,859 --> 00:10:44,343
<b>Is there a member you've wanted to meet here?</b>

313
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,559
<b>I...</b>

314
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:47,743
<b>We're here.</b>

315
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,870
<b>Just make yourself comfortable and talk.</b>

316
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,130
<b>- I wanted to meet Kwang Soo. - Why?</b>

317
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:51,270
<b>- Why? - Could you tell us why?</b>

318
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:52,422
<b>(He forces Seong Wu to say why.)</b>

319
00:10:52,469 --> 00:10:53,870
<b>He's very funny.</b>

320
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:56,609
<b>- I met him at an award ceremony. - That's right.</b>

321
00:10:56,609 --> 00:10:58,579
<b>When I met him there,</b>

322
00:10:58,579 --> 00:11:00,593
<b>I thought he was very humorous.</b>

323
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:04,593
<b>Do you remember anything he said that day?</b>

324
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,603
<b>Just make something up.</b>

325
00:11:09,189 --> 00:11:11,890
<b>(He said Kwang Soo was funny, but he doesn't remember anything.)</b>

326
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:14,243
<b>- He didn't listen carefully. - He just sighed.</b>

327
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,542
<b>- He just doesn't remember anything. - Why would he sigh?</b>

328
00:11:16,589 --> 00:11:17,973
<b>The end.</b>

329
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:22,113
<b>Today, we have Team Lee Kwang Soo with good-looking members...</b>

330
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:24,929
<b>and Team Jee Seok Jin with entertainers.</b>

331
00:11:24,929 --> 00:11:26,339
<b>- Is he the center? - What?</b>

332
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:27,682
<b>Is Kwang Soo the center?</b>

333
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:31,623
<b>All members get 50 R coins as base money at the beginning.</b>

334
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,939
<b>50 R coins? Today's race is about R coins.</b>

335
00:11:33,939 --> 00:11:35,833
<b>The team who wins in each mission...</b>

336
00:11:35,979 --> 00:11:37,650
<b>will hand in 15 R coins.</b>

337
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:40,979
<b>And the losing team will hand in 20 R coins.</b>

338
00:11:40,979 --> 00:11:44,520
<b>And the team with more R coins of the center...</b>

339
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,743
<b>- will win the race. - So it means...</b>

340
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:50,042
<b>I should have more coins in order to make our team win.</b>

341
00:11:50,089 --> 00:11:52,530
<b>- The coins of the center? - I should have more coins.</b>

342
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:53,743
<b>You should hand in your coins.</b>

343
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,169
<b>The center of the winning team...</b>

344
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:58,599
<b>and the top two members with most coins will win the prize.</b>

345
00:11:58,599 --> 00:12:00,370
<b>- Two members? - The center of the losing team...</b>

346
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:02,953
<b>and the two members with the least coins will get a penalty.</b>

347
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:05,139
<b>I will show you that Seok Jin will be torn...</b>

348
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:07,062
<b>into pieces in our team.</b>

349
00:12:07,209 --> 00:12:09,262
<b>I'll show you how he'll be torn.</b>

350
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:10,949
<b>I should trust my team members.</b>

351
00:12:10,949 --> 00:12:11,979
<b>(What's the first mission for R coins?)</b>

352
00:12:11,979 --> 00:12:13,203
<b>The first mission is...</b>

353
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,133
<b>Return of Unlucky Center.</b>

354
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:19,743
<b>We have 30 eggs here. 20 of them are boiled, and 10 are raw.</b>

355
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,089
<b>10 raw eggs?</b>

356
00:12:21,089 --> 00:12:22,390
<b>Gosh, that's a lot.</b>

357
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:24,729
<b>Each team will break 15 eggs.</b>

358
00:12:24,729 --> 00:12:26,743
<b>The team with less raw eggs wins the game.</b>

359
00:12:27,699 --> 00:12:29,782
<b>This is Kwang Soo's trademark.</b>

360
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:32,140
<b>- This is not good. - Look at that.</b>

361
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,140
<b>- You go first. - You should go first.</b>

362
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,522
<b>All right then.</b>

363
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,392
<b>- Se Chan, you go first. - Me?</b>

364
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:40,309
<b>- I'll try one first. - Okay.</b>

365
00:12:40,309 --> 00:12:41,493
<b>Se Chan.</b>

366
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:44,109
<b>- Se Chan. - It's good. I have a good feeling.</b>

367
00:12:44,109 --> 00:12:45,920
<b>- 1, 2, and... - I think it's raw.</b>

368
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,233
<b>1, 2, and 3.</b>

369
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,049
<b>- Okay. - Nice.</b>

370
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:51,219
<b>He did it.</b>

371
00:12:51,219 --> 00:12:52,772
<b>You just succeeded, so you can try one more time.</b>

372
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:54,089
<b>I think it will break.</b>

373
00:12:54,089 --> 00:12:55,859
<b>- There are 10 raw eggs. - Can I change it?</b>

374
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:57,929
<b>- No, you can't. - He says I can.</b>

375
00:12:57,929 --> 00:12:59,900
<b>- You can't switch. - You can't.</b>

376
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,660
<b>- No. It's over once you touch it. - Once you grab it,</b>

377
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:02,969
<b>you can feel it.</b>

378
00:13:02,969 --> 00:13:04,300
<b>Can you feel it? Go ahead and try.</b>

379
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,740
<b>- Why? - You said you can feel it.</b>

380
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:08,370
<b>Why are you twisting my arm?</b>

381
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,392
<b>(You can talk to me. Why are you twist my arm?)</b>

382
00:13:11,439 --> 00:13:13,140
<b>When did I twist your arm?</b>

383
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:16,609
<b>At a slight tickle, I feel pain here.</b>

384
00:13:16,609 --> 00:13:18,363
<b>- I didn't twist your arm. - It must've hurt a lot.</b>

385
00:13:18,579 --> 00:13:20,819
<b>You should sound strong.</b>

386
00:13:20,819 --> 00:13:22,620
<b>- "Why are you twisting my arm?" - Right.</b>

387
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,520
<b>- Why did you sound so gentle? - He sounded like a little kid.</b>

388
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,160
<b>- Did I do that? - I'm innocent.</b>

389
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,703
<b>You should yell at him.</b>

390
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,260
<b>(ZICO, Do Hyun, Ji Hun, and Seong Wu has broken 12 eggs.)</b>

391
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:32,412
<b>Good. You did a good job.</b>

392
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:35,030
<b>- Now it's Kwang Soo's turn. - Watch carefully, guys.</b>

393
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,400
<b>(Kwang Soo needs to break 3 eggs.)</b>

394
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,829
<b>You'll see why he's Lee Kwang Soo.</b>

395
00:13:37,829 --> 00:13:39,770
<b>(Watch carefully. You'll see why he's Lee Kwang Soo.)</b>

396
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:41,323
<b>- Good. - This is a good chance.</b>

397
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:42,593
<b>That's dangerous.</b>

398
00:13:42,609 --> 00:13:43,892
<b>- Yes! - Gosh.</b>

399
00:13:44,939 --> 00:13:46,623
<b>- What's with him? - Kwang Soo.</b>

400
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,709
<b>This is amazing.</b>

401
00:13:47,709 --> 00:13:49,479
<b>Kwang Soo, that doesn't seem like you.</b>

402
00:13:49,479 --> 00:13:51,192
<b>- Did you just drool? - I did.</b>

403
00:13:51,609 --> 00:13:54,020
<b>- Are you that happy? - I'm so thrilled.</b>

404
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,949
<b>Is this what you're doing today?</b>

405
00:13:55,949 --> 00:13:58,032
<b>I'm sorry. I was carried away. Just hurry.</b>

406
00:13:58,089 --> 00:13:59,373
<b>- He's drooling. - No.</b>

407
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:01,189
<b>- This is... - That's dangerous.</b>

408
00:14:01,189 --> 00:14:02,990
<b>(Did he pick a boiled egg again?)</b>

409
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:04,689
<b>- I have a bad feeling. - This is...</b>

410
00:14:04,689 --> 00:14:06,329
<b>(Stepping back)</b>

411
00:14:06,329 --> 00:14:07,900
<b>(Breaking)</b>

412
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,829
<b>(It's not surprising that he broke a raw egg.)</b>

413
00:14:09,829 --> 00:14:11,853
<b>I knew it.</b>

414
00:14:12,099 --> 00:14:13,599
<b>(He tries one more time.)</b>

415
00:14:13,599 --> 00:14:15,522
<b>- That's right. - It's okay.</b>

416
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,410
<b>- The probability isn't so bad. - It's okay.</b>

417
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:19,062
<b>- The odds are good. - You have one left.</b>

418
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:21,079
<b>- You're doing a good job. - Is your forehead okay?</b>

419
00:14:21,079 --> 00:14:23,010
<b>- Kwang Soo likes this game. - How many eggs?</b>

420
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:24,709
<b>They broke eight raw eggs.</b>

421
00:14:24,709 --> 00:14:27,349
<b>- You broke a lot of raw eggs. - We did a good job.</b>

422
00:14:27,349 --> 00:14:28,849
<b>- It's 8 out of 10. - 8 out of 10?</b>

423
00:14:28,849 --> 00:14:30,319
<b>We broke 8 out of 10, right?</b>

424
00:14:30,319 --> 00:14:32,050
<b>- Are there 10 raw eggs? - Right.</b>

425
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:33,419
<b>Shall we begin?</b>

426
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,819
<b>I'll break two eggs without a break.</b>

427
00:14:34,819 --> 00:14:36,412
<b>- What's that hat? - One...</b>

428
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:37,929
<b>- "What's that hat?" - It's funny, isn't it?</b>

429
00:14:37,929 --> 00:14:39,613
<b>Is it Leon's hat?</b>

430
00:14:40,359 --> 00:14:41,583
<b>It's 1 and 1.</b>

431
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,983
<b>It hurts.</b>

432
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:44,883
<b>Didn't it hurt?</b>

433
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,152
<b>I love this moment even though it hurts.</b>

434
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:49,652
<b>- Enjoy it. - I'm having a lot of fun.</b>

435
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:54,493
<b>So Min looks like she's on a spring picnic.</b>

436
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,279
<b>So Min looks pretty today.</b>

437
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,308
<b>It looks like a spring day.</b>

438
00:14:58,309 --> 00:14:59,902
<b>She looks like a freshman in college.</b>

439
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,849
<b>Look at her smile.</b>

440
00:15:01,849 --> 00:15:05,843
<b>Seriously, no one's looking at her as you say that.</b>

441
00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:07,490
<b>They all are staring into empty space.</b>

442
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,719
<b>They only care about eggs.</b>

443
00:15:08,719 --> 00:15:09,760
<b>They are looking at the apartments.</b>

444
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,829
<b>- Why are they so distracted? - It's unbelievable.</b>

445
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:13,383
<b>I know I'm quite old.</b>

446
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,859
<b>I admit it.</b>

447
00:15:14,859 --> 00:15:16,912
<b>So Min, just break an egg.</b>

448
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:20,300
<b>(So Min is back to her job.)</b>

449
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,670
<b>She's good. This is what you should do.</b>

450
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,140
<b>(She broke 2 raw eggs in a row.)</b>

451
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,363
<b>(The good-looking members respond to the raw eggs.)</b>

452
00:15:27,179 --> 00:15:28,640
<b>(Ji Hyo, Jong Kook, and Jae Seok broke eggs in turn.)</b>

453
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,833
<b>It broke.</b>

454
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:33,280
<b>- We don't know it yet. - It's a tie.</b>

455
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,880
<b>- How many eggs are left? 2? - Seok Jin, there are 2.</b>

456
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,402
<b>- There are only two. - I should do this right.</b>

457
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:38,772
<b>- Seok Jin, please. - It has to be raw.</b>

458
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:41,719
<b>(Raw)</b>

459
00:15:41,719 --> 00:15:44,473
<b>(What's Team Jee Seok Jin's fate?)</b>

460
00:15:46,359 --> 00:15:48,530
<b>(A raw egg)</b>

461
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,782
<b>(We win!)</b>

462
00:15:50,829 --> 00:15:53,022
<b>- Well done. - It's raw.</b>

463
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:54,953
<b>So what's good for them?</b>

464
00:15:56,069 --> 00:15:58,170
<b>- Why are you moving on so fast? - What's the rush?</b>

465
00:15:58,170 --> 00:15:59,240
<b>I don't know what else to do.</b>

466
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,463
<b>Since Team Lee Kwang Soo won, they should hand in 15 coins.</b>

467
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,650
<b>Team Jee Seok Jin lost, so they should hand in 20 coins.</b>

468
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:06,203
<b>It's just five more coins.</b>

469
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,473
<b>Now each member will go into the Cashier's office...</b>

470
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:12,990
<b>and hand in R coins in the order that the center determines.</b>

471
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:15,390
<b>As I informed you earlier, the center goes in there last...</b>

472
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:17,260
<b>and return the R coins to make up the shortage.</b>

473
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,000
<b>And the center...</b>

474
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,912
<b>can check the remaining R coins of the members.</b>

475
00:16:20,929 --> 00:16:24,753
<b>And he can point out the member who returned least R coins.</b>

476
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,370
<b>If the center points out the member who handed in the fewest coins,</b>

477
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:30,652
<b>the member will make up the difference instead of the center.</b>

478
00:16:30,709 --> 00:16:32,839
<b>I didn't know about that.</b>

479
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:34,339
<b>If he fails to single out the betrayer,</b>

480
00:16:34,339 --> 00:16:37,493
<b>the center will hand in another five coins for not believing his member.</b>

481
00:16:38,449 --> 00:16:39,833
<b>- If I get it wrong... - Yes.</b>

482
00:16:39,849 --> 00:16:41,420
<b>When you go into the Cashier's office,</b>

483
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:44,103
<b>you'll be told the cumulative number of coins.</b>

484
00:16:45,219 --> 00:16:47,490
<b>- The winning team goes first. - Okay.</b>

485
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:49,243
<b>Let's make this look beautiful.</b>

486
00:16:49,329 --> 00:16:50,429
<b>We should do this equally.</b>

487
00:16:50,429 --> 00:16:52,358
<b>Three coins per person.</b>

488
00:16:52,359 --> 00:16:54,000
<b>Then you won't have to return your coins.</b>

489
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,129
<b>We should protect Kwang Soo.</b>

490
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:57,599
<b>- We should. - Right.</b>

491
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:00,270
<b>- So we will hand in our coins. - Okay.</b>

492
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,870
<b>- Let's do this right. - Do we need to give 20 coins?</b>

493
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:04,209
<b>- We should hand in 20 coins. - How many coins per person?</b>

494
00:17:04,209 --> 00:17:05,709
<b>- Let's be conscientious... - Hand in three coins.</b>

495
00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:06,939
<b>Three coins per person.</b>

496
00:17:06,939 --> 00:17:09,450
<b>- And I'll hand in five coins. - That would look great.</b>

497
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:11,050
<b>- Let's do that. - All right.</b>

498
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:12,649
<b>- I'll hand in 3 coins. - 3 coins.</b>

499
00:17:12,649 --> 00:17:14,863
<b>This is just the beginning.</b>

500
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:16,619
<b>- Seok Jin. - This is the first game.</b>

501
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:17,649
<b>This is the first game.</b>

502
00:17:17,649 --> 00:17:19,419
<b>I can tell that you're thinking of petty tricks.</b>

503
00:17:19,419 --> 00:17:22,343
<b>- Me? That's not true. - He should single out a member.</b>

504
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:25,359
<b>Even if I don't hand in my coins, I'll be safe if he guesses wrong.</b>

505
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,142
<b>That's why I have to hand in three coins.</b>

506
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,652
<b>- You go first then. - Kwang Soo, determine the order.</b>

507
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,270
<b>I'll call the most reliable one first.</b>

508
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:35,553
<b>Do Hyun goes first.</b>

509
00:17:35,569 --> 00:17:36,669
<b>- Me? - Okay.</b>

510
00:17:36,669 --> 00:17:38,492
<b>- Do Hyun goes first. - Yes. I'll be right back.</b>

511
00:17:38,569 --> 00:17:40,139
<b>- Just three coins. - Remember what we said.</b>

512
00:17:40,139 --> 00:17:43,510
<b>- I don't want anything else. - I think they are naive and nice.</b>

513
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:44,809
<b>They seem very nice.</b>

514
00:17:44,809 --> 00:17:46,180
<b>Can I give you my coins here?</b>

515
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,763
<b>(Do Hyun seems quite reliable. How many coins is he handing in?)</b>

516
00:17:49,349 --> 00:17:52,002
<b>(He promised to give 3 coins.)</b>

517
00:17:53,889 --> 00:17:57,573
<b>(Do Hyun handed in 3 coins as he promised.)</b>

518
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,182
<b>He handed some to them.</b>

519
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:05,212
<b>- Next up is Ji Hun. - Okay.</b>

520
00:18:05,329 --> 00:18:07,652
<b>You shouldn't give them any.</b>

521
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,553
<b>How many did the person in front of me give?</b>

522
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:15,462
<b>(Do Hyun gave 3 coins.)</b>

523
00:18:16,409 --> 00:18:19,133
<b>(Will he keep his end of the bargain as well?)</b>

524
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,103
<b>(He gives 3 as well.)</b>

525
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:27,873
<b>Kwang Soo will probably suspect me, right?</b>

526
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:30,129
<b>- Here. - Take them.</b>

527
00:18:30,129 --> 00:18:32,329
<b>- ZICO, why are looking at me? - Gosh.</b>

528
00:18:32,329 --> 00:18:35,383
<b>I can't believe you. Isn't it a bit too early?</b>

529
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,970
<b>- Why are you looking at me? - Isn't it a bit early?</b>

530
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:40,023
<b>Kwang Soo, go.</b>

531
00:18:40,069 --> 00:18:41,399
<b>Can I pick Se Chan before paying up?</b>

532
00:18:41,399 --> 00:18:42,740
<b>- Don't do that. - No?</b>

533
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:43,839
<b>- Just go first. - Do I need to go first?</b>

534
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,839
<b>You've already betrayed us.</b>

535
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:46,123
<b>(He's going to check how many coins there are.)</b>

536
00:18:46,339 --> 00:18:48,109
<b>(Did any of them betray the team?)</b>

537
00:18:48,109 --> 00:18:49,192
<b>Hello.</b>

538
00:18:52,649 --> 00:18:54,619
<b>(There should be a total of 15 coins.)</b>

539
00:18:54,619 --> 00:18:55,889
<b>(There are 12 coins in total. 3 are missing.)</b>

540
00:18:55,889 --> 00:18:57,002
<b>"12"?</b>

541
00:18:58,550 --> 00:18:59,742
<b>"12"?</b>

542
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:01,873
<b>Do I pick the suspect here?</b>

543
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,129
<b>Or do I do it over there?</b>

544
00:19:03,129 --> 00:19:05,313
<b>(He can either pay for everything or catch the traitor.)</b>

545
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:09,300
<b>- Can I pick without paying up? - Yes.</b>

546
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,383
<b>I'll do that.</b>

547
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,800
<b>Okay.</b>

548
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,800
<b>(He's going to pick the traitor.)</b>

549
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,139
<b>- Kwang Soo. - Yes?</b>

550
00:19:14,139 --> 00:19:15,793
<b>How many did you give them?</b>

551
00:19:15,869 --> 00:19:17,752
<b>Look at his face.</b>

552
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,139
<b>You look worked up.</b>

553
00:19:20,139 --> 00:19:21,680
<b>- I'm fine. - He must've paid a lot.</b>

554
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,849
<b>You look upset.</b>

555
00:19:22,849 --> 00:19:26,680
<b>There's a filthy loach among us.</b>

556
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,050
<b>(They burst into laughter.)</b>

557
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:30,689
<b>- There's one. - I bet there are more.</b>

558
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:33,190
<b>I'm going to catch him.</b>

559
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:34,290
<b>- One? - Really?</b>

560
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:35,873
<b>There is one loach...</b>

561
00:19:36,089 --> 00:19:38,389
<b>- Is there a loach among you? - that is ruining our team.</b>

562
00:19:38,389 --> 00:19:39,659
<b>I can see my future in him.</b>

563
00:19:39,659 --> 00:19:41,129
<b>- Please pick. - I trust you guys.</b>

564
00:19:41,129 --> 00:19:42,283
<b>I pick...</b>

565
00:19:42,829 --> 00:19:46,982
<b>(Which one of them does he think paid the least amount?)</b>

566
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,109
<b>Se Chan.</b>

567
00:19:50,109 --> 00:19:52,452
<b>(He picks Se Chan.)</b>

568
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:54,040
<b>I think Se Chan paid up.</b>

569
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,339
<b>- Goodness. - He did.</b>

570
00:19:55,339 --> 00:19:57,432
<b>There's no one else to pick.</b>

571
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:00,050
<b>Seong Wu looks brazen.</b>

572
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:01,680
<b>- Guys like him betray easily. - You paid?</b>

573
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,803
<b>- Let's see the result. - I'll tell you.</b>

574
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:07,202
<b>Kwang Soo, you have...</b>

575
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,990
<b>- failed. - Hey.</b>

576
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:12,343
<b>- See? - Please pay five more coins.</b>

577
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:15,442
<b>You'll become broke if you trust the wrong people.</b>

578
00:20:17,669 --> 00:20:18,769
<b>What?</b>

579
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:19,800
<b>The total is...</b>

580
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,593
<b>(Se Chan checked the total amount.)</b>

581
00:20:23,069 --> 00:20:24,240
<b>(I should pay 3 coins.)</b>

582
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,793
<b>(He'll pick me, then.)</b>

583
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:29,780
<b>(He wanted Kwang Soo to suspect him and paid 3 coins.)</b>

584
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:33,479
<b>The loach is among them!</b>

585
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,780
<b>- It's 1 of these 3. - I saw all of them paying.</b>

586
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:38,119
<b>ZICO seemed as if he was wrongfully accused.</b>

587
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:40,589
<b>(Which one of them is the loach?)</b>

588
00:20:40,589 --> 00:20:42,972
<b>Kwang Soo, please pay five more coins.</b>

589
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:44,472
<b>I should've just paid three back then.</b>

590
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:48,883
<b>(He pays 5 more for wrongfully suspecting Se Chan.)</b>

591
00:20:49,329 --> 00:20:51,853
<b>We'll start with our loach.</b>

592
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:54,740
<b>- I'm speechless and upset. - She'll go first.</b>

593
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:57,540
<b>- She won't be able to betray us. - I'm a scapegoat.</b>

594
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,710
<b>The loach will go first.</b>

595
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:00,793
<b>(Lady Loach goes first.)</b>

596
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:05,409
<b>(Amidst everyone's suspicion, what will she do?)</b>

597
00:21:05,409 --> 00:21:07,149
<b>You're already back?</b>

598
00:21:07,149 --> 00:21:09,419
<b>- Yes, because I paid. - Did you not pay?</b>

599
00:21:09,419 --> 00:21:11,550
<b>- Really? Let me check. - I think this is...</b>

600
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:13,760
<b>- a good deal. - I bet she paid up this time.</b>

601
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,059
<b>- You're right. - Because...</b>

602
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:17,559
<b>- She got caught in the first round. - Of course, I paid up.</b>

603
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:19,043
<b>There's no way I wouldn't have.</b>

604
00:21:19,159 --> 00:21:21,159
<b>Seok Jin, you need to watch Jae Seok.</b>

605
00:21:21,159 --> 00:21:24,283
<b>I bet Jae Seok will accuse me no matter what.</b>

606
00:21:24,829 --> 00:21:27,123
<b>See? He's acting.</b>

607
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,500
<b>(Exclaiming)</b>

608
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,908
<b>Look at how awkward he looks.</b>

609
00:21:30,909 --> 00:21:32,422
<b>Already?</b>

610
00:21:33,139 --> 00:21:34,363
<b>Then...</b>

611
00:21:35,639 --> 00:21:36,763
<b>Here.</b>

612
00:21:38,309 --> 00:21:40,780
<b>(Next up is Haha.)</b>

613
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,119
<b>(There's a total of 3 coins.)</b>

614
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:43,819
<b>(There are only 3 coins.)</b>

615
00:21:43,819 --> 00:21:46,373
<b>Someone didn't pay, right?</b>

616
00:21:46,589 --> 00:21:48,020
<b>- Then... - I'll...</b>

617
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,829
<b>(Haha, Jong Kook, and Ji Hyo have paid.)</b>

618
00:21:49,829 --> 00:21:51,430
<b>I trust you guys.</b>

619
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:53,230
<b>I hope I'll be able to smile when I get there.</b>

620
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:56,313
<b>I had no idea So Min would do that from the get-go.</b>

621
00:21:57,669 --> 00:21:59,839
<b>- Goodness. - He's driving me crazy.</b>

622
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:00,922
<b>Gosh.</b>

623
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,839
<b>My goodness.</b>

624
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:05,940
<b>They've all gone insane.</b>

625
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,492
<b>How could they do this?</b>

626
00:22:07,609 --> 00:22:10,232
<b>Is it that hard to pay three coins?</b>

627
00:22:11,849 --> 00:22:14,220
<b>I did expect some of them to betray the team but...</b>

628
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,763
<b>(He needs to pay all 14 coins or pick out the traitor.)</b>

629
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:18,972
<b>Gosh.</b>

630
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:20,720
<b>You guys are something.</b>

631
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,389
<b>- Seok Jin, trust me. - Did you see?</b>

632
00:22:22,389 --> 00:22:24,629
<b>There is a loach among us.</b>

633
00:22:24,629 --> 00:22:26,230
<b>- Seok Jin. - Catch the loach.</b>

634
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:27,328
<b>- Seok Jin. - Yes.</b>

635
00:22:27,329 --> 00:22:28,912
<b>Jae Seok looks thirsty.</b>

636
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:31,169
<b>Will you pay up or pick the suspect?</b>

637
00:22:31,169 --> 00:22:33,440
<b>The latter, of course. I'd be a fool not to.</b>

638
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,770
<b>If you pick me,</b>

639
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,369
<b>- that would be your mistake. - Pick one.</b>

640
00:22:36,369 --> 00:22:37,909
<b>You need to trust me.</b>

641
00:22:37,909 --> 00:22:39,639
<b>- Jae Seok looks anxious. - Your mouth's full.</b>

642
00:22:39,639 --> 00:22:41,210
<b>Look at me.</b>

643
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:43,763
<b>- How many did you pay? - I didn't know she'd betray us.</b>

644
00:22:43,879 --> 00:22:47,149
<b>I'll be honest. I paid two coins.</b>

645
00:22:47,149 --> 00:22:48,220
<b>That little...</b>

646
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,319
<b>(I know the truth.)</b>

647
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:50,819
<b>- I'm serious. - I ought to just...</b>

648
00:22:50,819 --> 00:22:52,790
<b>- You paid two coins? - Yes.</b>

649
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:54,073
<b>I paid two coins.</b>

650
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:56,859
<b>If the people who went first paid the correct amount,</b>

651
00:22:56,859 --> 00:22:58,889
<b>- I'd be relieved. - Hey.</b>

652
00:22:58,889 --> 00:23:01,859
<b>Will you only believe me once I crack one of these open?</b>

653
00:23:01,859 --> 00:23:04,270
<b>- What are you doing? - I'm innocent!</b>

654
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:05,930
<b>- Goodness. - You picked the right ones.</b>

655
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:07,869
<b>- You did. - You picked well.</b>

656
00:23:07,869 --> 00:23:09,169
<b>He's extremely unlucky.</b>

657
00:23:09,169 --> 00:23:11,240
<b>- That's strange. - Why were all of them...</b>

658
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,909
<b>- boiled eggs? - None of them were raw.</b>

659
00:23:12,909 --> 00:23:14,540
<b>- One of them should've burst. - I bet you paid one.</b>

660
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,780
<b>- One? - Jae Seok too.</b>

661
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,550
<b>I paid two!</b>

662
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:19,363
<b>- I paid two! - You're good.</b>

663
00:23:19,379 --> 00:23:21,419
<b>- You're good. - You are.</b>

664
00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:23,050
<b>There aren't even that many eggs left.</b>

665
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:24,373
<b>Goodness.</b>

666
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:25,720
<b>Why are all of them boiled?</b>

667
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,260
<b>You should've been this lucky during the previous game.</b>

668
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:29,202
<b>I can't express my innocence!</b>

669
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:31,389
<b>- Goodness. - Please pick the suspect.</b>

670
00:23:31,389 --> 00:23:32,588
<b>Okay.</b>

671
00:23:32,589 --> 00:23:33,760
<b>I think he'll get it right.</b>

672
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,299
<b>(Will he be able to pick out the traitor?)</b>

673
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,369
<b>- Jae Seok! - Goodness.</b>

674
00:23:38,369 --> 00:23:39,440
<b>Jae Seok.</b>

675
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,740
<b>- I think So Min... - You're probably right.</b>

676
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:41,940
<b>- paid 1 coin. - I paid 2 coins.</b>

677
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,139
<b>I bet she paid one.</b>

678
00:23:43,139 --> 00:23:44,940
<b>- You paid two? - I'm sure she paid.</b>

679
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,579
<b>- You caught him. - I did.</b>

680
00:23:46,579 --> 00:23:48,863
<b>- Seok Jin, - I got it right.</b>

681
00:23:48,909 --> 00:23:50,432
<b>you have...</b>

682
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:52,979
<b>- failed. - What?</b>

683
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,280
<b>I told you.</b>

684
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,118
<b>- You paid? - She...</b>

685
00:23:56,119 --> 00:23:57,950
<b>Why didn't you believe me?</b>

686
00:23:57,950 --> 00:23:59,232
<b>(Is the traitor someone else?)</b>

687
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:03,260
<b>(Jae Seok paid 2 coins.)</b>

688
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,472
<b>I should do this.</b>

689
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:06,460
<b>You know, right?</b>

690
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:08,442
<b>- She's the real culprit. - My gosh.</b>

691
00:24:08,659 --> 00:24:10,613
<b>- Who didn't pay up? - It's So Min.</b>

692
00:24:11,369 --> 00:24:16,770
<b>I know it looks like I'll pay three, but I won't.</b>

693
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:18,210
<b>(Ji Hyo didn't pay anything.)</b>

694
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:19,293
<b>Okay.</b>

695
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:22,909
<b>The first mission is over.</b>

696
00:24:22,909 --> 00:24:24,950
<b>Change into your uniforms and move to the next location.</b>

697
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:27,502
<b>(Both centers failed to catch the traitors and paid more.)</b>

698
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,690
<b>(There's a mysterious ranking list.)</b>

699
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:33,202
<b>What are these photos?</b>

700
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:35,190
<b>You guys look so unctuous.</b>

701
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:37,212
<b>That's the face Kwang Soo makes when taking photos.</b>

702
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:39,290
<b>- He raises his head. - It's my favorite photo.</b>

703
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:40,530
<b>He loves that angle.</b>

704
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:41,629
<b>He poses like that at airports abroad.</b>

705
00:24:41,629 --> 00:24:44,313
<b>- He likes that angle. - It's that.</b>

706
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:47,583
<b>Excuse me, but are Se Chan and Kwang Soo in disguises?</b>

707
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
<b>(They look too ugly.)</b>

708
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,108
<b>Not at all.</b>

709
00:24:50,109 --> 00:24:52,422
<b>Our team is known for being good-looking.</b>

710
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:55,839
<b>This mission is called Get into Any Rankings.</b>

711
00:24:55,839 --> 00:24:57,533
<b>(Get into Any Rankings)</b>

712
00:24:57,609 --> 00:24:59,763
<b>Get into any rankings</b>

713
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:01,480
<b><i>What's the problem?</i></b>

714
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,919
<b>A professional company...</b>

715
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:07,142
<b>has surveyed 112 individuals in their 20s and 60s.</b>

716
00:25:07,159 --> 00:25:08,873
<b>I'll give you a different genre for each round.</b>

717
00:25:08,919 --> 00:25:12,430
<b>Predict your rankings after discussing among yourselves.</b>

718
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:15,099
<b>Place your pieces among the 12 rankings.</b>

719
00:25:15,099 --> 00:25:16,912
<b>You'll get points if you're right.</b>

720
00:25:17,669 --> 00:25:20,800
<b>- I need to rank myself? - Correct.</b>

721
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,099
<b>More than one piece...</b>

722
00:25:22,099 --> 00:25:24,293
<b>- can be on each ranking. - Really?</b>

723
00:25:24,409 --> 00:25:26,740
<b>The team that gets the most correct rankings wins.</b>

724
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:29,579
<b>You'll need to get 2 out of the 3 rounds correct.</b>

725
00:25:29,579 --> 00:25:31,392
<b>This is tricky.</b>

726
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:33,232
<b>We don't know how others think of us.</b>

727
00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:35,363
<b>- Here's the first question. - Okay.</b>

728
00:25:35,819 --> 00:25:39,103
<b>We asked 112 people in their 20s to 60s.</b>

729
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:40,389
<b>"Who do you think was the most popular..."</b>

730
00:25:40,389 --> 00:25:41,720
<b>"to the opposite gender when they were young?"</b>

731
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,430
<b>(Who do you think was the most popular...)</b>

732
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:44,942
<b>(to the opposite gender when they were young?)</b>

733
00:25:45,389 --> 00:25:47,482
<b>- This is... - This is easy.</b>

734
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,899
<b>This is...</b>

735
00:25:48,899 --> 00:25:51,930
<b>- definitely me. - Popular to the opposite gender?</b>

736
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:54,500
<b>The most likely ones are over there.</b>

737
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,252
<b>- Right. - There's ZICO,</b>

738
00:25:57,569 --> 00:25:59,109
<b>Seong Wu, and more.</b>

739
00:25:59,109 --> 00:26:01,063
<b>The four lowest rankings are neck and neck.</b>

740
00:26:01,409 --> 00:26:03,010
<b>We're definitely neck and neck.</b>

741
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:04,510
<b>- That's heartbreaking. - Four?</b>

742
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:06,250
<b>Yes, four. We'll be neck and neck.</b>

743
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:08,303
<b>You're right.</b>

744
00:26:08,919 --> 00:26:10,020
<b>When we were young?</b>

745
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:12,418
<b>The age range is...</b>

746
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:14,290
<b>- Too broad? - Yes.</b>

747
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:16,730
<b>- I think you and Se Chan... - I agree.</b>

748
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:19,460
<b>- will be placed higher. - But...</b>

749
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,559
<b>Seong Wu said something very kind.</b>

750
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:24,083
<b>He said the age range was too broad,</b>

751
00:26:24,129 --> 00:26:27,182
<b>so the others had good chances as well.</b>

752
00:26:27,339 --> 00:26:29,399
<b>- Not at all. - He's so kindhearted.</b>

753
00:26:29,399 --> 00:26:31,210
<b>- That's not what I meant. - He said it so nicely.</b>

754
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:33,379
<b>- Thanks. - That's not what I meant.</b>

755
00:26:33,379 --> 00:26:36,932
<b>Since the elderly know them two better...</b>

756
00:26:37,109 --> 00:26:38,392
<b>That wasn't the nuance he gave off earlier.</b>

757
00:26:38,609 --> 00:26:40,180
<b>It sounded like he was saying, "Cheer up."</b>

758
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:42,303
<b>(He was pitying them.)</b>

759
00:26:42,349 --> 00:26:43,849
<b>- "You can do it." - "You can do it."</b>

760
00:26:43,849 --> 00:26:45,672
<b>- That's what I felt. - Not at all.</b>

761
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:48,319
<b>I wasn't going to say this.</b>

762
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:49,730
<b>(He suddenly interrupts them.)</b>

763
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:51,212
<b>Then don't say it.</b>

764
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:53,430
<b>Cut.</b>

765
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:56,299
<b>It's best not to say anything if you're hesitant.</b>

766
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,083
<b>Let me brag about my bachelor days.</b>

767
00:26:58,629 --> 00:27:00,623
<b>I hope this will help.</b>

768
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:03,940
<b>Someone asked for my number on the streets.</b>

769
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:05,869
<b>Did you give them your pager number or what?</b>

770
00:27:05,869 --> 00:27:07,139
<b>- What? - What did you give them back then?</b>

771
00:27:07,139 --> 00:27:08,309
<b>We didn't even have pagers.</b>

772
00:27:08,309 --> 00:27:09,680
<b>Did you give them your homing pigeon's name?</b>

773
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,232
<b>(Did they exchange letters through homing pigeons?)</b>

774
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:15,819
<b>- 9999-9999? - "9999"?</b>

775
00:27:15,819 --> 00:27:18,002
<b>They asked me...</b>

776
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:19,818
<b>- for my number. - Cut.</b>

777
00:27:19,819 --> 00:27:21,990
<b>What about you, Do Hyun? Were you popular?</b>

778
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:23,530
<b>- I bet he was. - Do tell us.</b>

779
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:26,190
<b>We need to rank ourselves.</b>

780
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:27,930
<b>Back then, you had to be humble...</b>

781
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:29,669
<b>- and not brag about such things. - Right.</b>

782
00:27:29,669 --> 00:27:31,300
<b>- But times have changed. - Right.</b>

783
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,300
<b>- To be honest, - Yes, be honest.</b>

784
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:36,639
<b>it was Valentine's Day in elementary school.</b>

785
00:27:36,639 --> 00:27:38,770
<b>There were chocolates on my desk.</b>

786
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:40,780
<b>- How much did you have? - On your desk?</b>

787
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:42,780
<b>- Can I brag? - Of course.</b>

788
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:46,033
<b>- You can. - He's almost 60, and he bragged.</b>

789
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:48,879
<b>My mom came to school...</b>

790
00:27:48,879 --> 00:27:50,690
<b>- and helped me carry them home. - My goodness.</b>

791
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:53,020
<b>This was in second grade.</b>

792
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,790
<b>Did you participate in relay races during field day?</b>

793
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:56,089
<b>- Every time. - Goodness.</b>

794
00:27:56,089 --> 00:27:57,430
<b>Then there's nothing more to say.</b>

795
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:58,990
<b>- I was the last runner. - The fourth runner!</b>

796
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:00,099
<b>- He was the fourth runner. - The fourth runner?</b>

797
00:28:00,099 --> 00:28:02,159
<b>The fourth runner is always the popular one.</b>

798
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,452
<b>- Seok Jin... - I was quite athletic.</b>

799
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:06,740
<b>- Didn't you play basketball? - In school.</b>

800
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:09,353
<b>Yes, I played basketball in high school.</b>

801
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:11,869
<b>- Then girls would've liked him. - He had to be popular.</b>

802
00:28:11,869 --> 00:28:14,480
<b>- Sports drinks... - Beverages?</b>

803
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,639
<b>Girls gave him sports drinks.</b>

804
00:28:15,639 --> 00:28:18,079
<b>- Yes, sports drinks. - He reminds me...</b>

805
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:19,649
<b>- of the protagonists in TV dramas. - Right?</b>

806
00:28:19,649 --> 00:28:21,980
<b>We see people like him in TV commercials too.</b>

807
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:22,990
<b>Yes, by the fountain.</b>

808
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:24,649
<b>Ji Hun, what about you?</b>

809
00:28:24,649 --> 00:28:25,720
<b>Me?</b>

810
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,558
<b>In middle school, after classes began,</b>

811
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,430
<b>for about three days...</b>

812
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:31,912
<b>(For 3 days after starting middle school...)</b>

813
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,858
<b>- Yes? - What happened?</b>

814
00:28:33,859 --> 00:28:36,530
<b>Girls were lined up.</b>

815
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:37,530
<b>- And... - Just to see you?</b>

816
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:38,730
<b>To get a glimpse of you?</b>

817
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:41,252
<b>So that they could cleanse their eyes!</b>

818
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:42,569
<b>Girls come by to look at handsome boys.</b>

819
00:28:42,569 --> 00:28:44,440
<b>I can't believe things like that happens.</b>

820
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,770
<b>- Exactly. - Girls line up?</b>

821
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:49,079
<b>We only thought that happened in movies or TV dramas.</b>

822
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:51,109
<b>Many went by to get a glimpse of Se Chan too,</b>

823
00:28:51,109 --> 00:28:52,280
<b>but for a different reason.</b>

824
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,349
<b>- Like coming to the zoo? - To get a good laugh.</b>

825
00:28:54,349 --> 00:28:55,649
<b>- Right. - Because they were fascinated.</b>

826
00:28:55,649 --> 00:28:57,990
<b>Now let's hear from ZICO.</b>

827
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:01,819
<b>I wasn't a popular kid because of my looks,</b>

828
00:29:01,819 --> 00:29:03,659
<b>- but retreats or... - Exactly.</b>

829
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:05,730
<b>- at school picnics. - Because you could sing.</b>

830
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:08,000
<b>After performing in front of the other kids,</b>

831
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,460
<b>I'd rise in fame.</b>

832
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:11,482
<b>Which song did you perform to?</b>

833
00:29:11,569 --> 00:29:14,169
<b>"Rising Sun" by TVXQ.</b>

834
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,169
<b>"Rising Sun"?</b>

835
00:29:15,169 --> 00:29:17,270
<b>Could you show us how you performed to it?</b>

836
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:19,123
<b>I don't remember anymore,</b>

837
00:29:22,139 --> 00:29:24,280
<b>but it was something like this.</b>

838
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,010
<b>Well, he's such a good dancer.</b>

839
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:27,450
<b>He looks cool even dancing those small moves.</b>

840
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:28,919
<b>Se Chan, how about you?</b>

841
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:30,450
<b>In my case...</b>

842
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:31,550
<b>How have you been lately?</b>

843
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:33,159
<b>- How have I been lately? - Are you good?</b>

844
00:29:33,159 --> 00:29:34,989
<b>Yes, I've been studying to learn new things.</b>

845
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:38,242
<b>I'm not kidding when I say that in high school,</b>

846
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:42,283
<b>a group of girls actually...</b>

847
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:44,069
<b>fought over me.</b>

848
00:29:44,069 --> 00:29:45,069
<b>- What? - Why?</b>

849
00:29:45,069 --> 00:29:47,369
<b>They liked me so much and they all wanted me.</b>

850
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:48,740
<b>- What? - They fought over me.</b>

851
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:49,869
<b>It's not a joke.</b>

852
00:29:49,869 --> 00:29:51,809
<b>This is the most hilarious thing you said today.</b>

853
00:29:51,809 --> 00:29:53,839
<b>Really? So what happened?</b>

854
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:56,879
<b>Well, the choice was mine. I had to make a choice.</b>

855
00:29:56,879 --> 00:29:58,550
<b>After fighting over him,</b>

856
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:01,402
<b>they came to the conclusion that it was a draw.</b>

857
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:04,349
<b>Just like we predicted,</b>

858
00:30:04,349 --> 00:30:07,059
<b>a lot of the members on that team will probably be...</b>

859
00:30:07,059 --> 00:30:08,059
<b>- high up in the rankings. - That's right.</b>

860
00:30:08,059 --> 00:30:11,190
<b>Let me tell you one hard fact though.</b>

861
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:13,099
<b>I went on my first group blind date in high school.</b>

862
00:30:13,099 --> 00:30:15,313
<b>Was it in Hanyang?</b>

863
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:18,300
<b>Yes, we traveled on horses to get there.</b>

864
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,970
<b>Where did you tie up your horse then?</b>

865
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:21,440
<b>- Your horse... - My horse?</b>

866
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,040
<b>- Next to Namdaemun... - He's taking it for now.</b>

867
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,809
<b>There were trees alongside it.</b>

868
00:30:24,809 --> 00:30:26,579
<b>- Trees? - What did you do on dates?</b>

869
00:30:26,579 --> 00:30:27,809
<b>Shoot arrows?</b>

870
00:30:27,809 --> 00:30:29,180
<b>Or a game of tuho?</b>

871
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,280
<b>Don't be ridiculous.</b>

872
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,180
<b>We just wrote down names...</b>

873
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,603
<b>- on a paper. - Really?</b>

874
00:30:33,649 --> 00:30:35,363
<b>But you would've had to write it in Chinese characters.</b>

875
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,573
<b>We still wrote in ancient Korean, so don't worry.</b>

876
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,103
<b>Ancient Korean?</b>

877
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:41,659
<b>We wrote in Korean, all right?</b>

878
00:30:41,659 --> 00:30:44,043
<b>The Korean published in Hunminjeongeum.</b>

879
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:46,260
<b>That's what we wrote in.</b>

880
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,300
<b>So three girls wrote your name down?</b>

881
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,659
<b>Ji Hyo, I bet you were popular in school.</b>

882
00:30:48,659 --> 00:30:49,730
<b>Of course, right?</b>

883
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:51,069
<b>- Me? - She probably was.</b>

884
00:30:51,069 --> 00:30:52,069
<b>I bet she was popular.</b>

885
00:30:52,069 --> 00:30:54,482
<b>I never went on group blind dates...</b>

886
00:30:54,839 --> 00:30:57,770
<b>and no one set me up on blind dates either.</b>

887
00:30:57,770 --> 00:31:00,280
<b>Popular kids don't know that they're popular.</b>

888
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,079
<b>- They don't. - Later on in life,</b>

889
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:03,849
<b>you realize you were popular.</b>

890
00:31:03,849 --> 00:31:05,909
<b>She was a cavewoman back then too, so of course, she didn't know.</b>

891
00:31:05,909 --> 00:31:07,720
<b>I never caught on to those things.</b>

892
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:10,750
<b>You probably all know Ji Hyo's photo from high school.</b>

893
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,419
<b>The one with the slick bangs.</b>

894
00:31:12,419 --> 00:31:14,460
<b>It looks like she had a temper back then.</b>

895
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,290
<b>- Tell us how it was. - That was me in high school.</b>

896
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:18,829
<b>The middle school I attended had some strict rules.</b>

897
00:31:18,829 --> 00:31:20,200
<b>Our hair had to be a short bob.</b>

898
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,359
<b>You definitely are older than how you look.</b>

899
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:24,629
<b>- Now I'm curious. - Is this you in middle school?</b>

900
00:31:24,629 --> 00:31:26,069
<b>- Yes, that. - In middle school?</b>

901
00:31:26,069 --> 00:31:28,752
<b>- No wonder... - I had just been crying.</b>

902
00:31:28,839 --> 00:31:31,023
<b>- So there you are. - I don't mind your hair though.</b>

903
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:32,809
<b>You were pretty.</b>

904
00:31:32,809 --> 00:31:34,209
<b>So Min, what about you?</b>

905
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:36,962
<b>Many think that I was popular in school,</b>

906
00:31:37,149 --> 00:31:39,609
<b>but my mom never helped me carry the chocolates I received.</b>

907
00:31:39,609 --> 00:31:42,250
<b>In fact, she helped me make...</b>

908
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:44,250
<b>the chocolates I wanted to give to the boy I like.</b>

909
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:45,750
<b>I feel bad for your mom.</b>

910
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:47,619
<b>- Goodness. - She helped me make them.</b>

911
00:31:47,619 --> 00:31:49,889
<b>- When it comes to love... - That's right.</b>

912
00:31:49,889 --> 00:31:51,030
<b>She makes sure she gets it.</b>

913
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:53,159
<b>The boys that I liked...</b>

914
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:55,200
<b>would like my best friends though.</b>

915
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,260
<b>I have some sad memories.</b>

916
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:58,099
<b>So that's what it was like for So Min.</b>

917
00:31:58,099 --> 00:32:00,639
<b>The boys she liked had feelings for someone else.</b>

918
00:32:00,639 --> 00:32:02,869
<b>- Jae Seok too. - It was like that for me too.</b>

919
00:32:02,869 --> 00:32:04,669
<b>- He'd bring up the mood. - Things would heat up,</b>

920
00:32:04,669 --> 00:32:07,440
<b>but the ladies would choose my friends instead.</b>

921
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,210
<b>Jong Kook, weren't you popular too?</b>

922
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:10,609
<b>- Most definitely. - Well,</b>

923
00:32:10,609 --> 00:32:11,849
<b>I...</b>

924
00:32:11,849 --> 00:32:13,349
<b>- Of course, he was famous. - Older girls were more fond of me.</b>

925
00:32:13,349 --> 00:32:15,363
<b>That suits you though.</b>

926
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:17,290
<b>Nothing can be better than that.</b>

927
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:19,250
<b>There was a salon I'd go to when I was in high school.</b>

928
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:20,559
<b>- He's on a different level. - The hairstylists?</b>

929
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:21,990
<b>- The older girls there... - The hairstylists?</b>

930
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:24,559
<b>- Yes, in their early 20s. - They were adults then.</b>

931
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:26,659
<b>Yes, older girls liked me when I was in high school.</b>

932
00:32:26,659 --> 00:32:28,829
<b>It's probably because you managed the store.</b>

933
00:32:28,829 --> 00:32:29,912
<b>(That's why.)</b>

934
00:32:30,169 --> 00:32:31,669
<b>I bet you were cool back then.</b>

935
00:32:31,669 --> 00:32:33,300
<b>You managed salons too?</b>

936
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,200
<b>- You managed stores? - Really?</b>

937
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,909
<b>- No, hold on. - I had no idea.</b>

938
00:32:37,909 --> 00:32:39,369
<b>You managed the salon for them?</b>

939
00:32:39,369 --> 00:32:41,280
<b>- Is that what you did? - Anyway,</b>

940
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,639
<b>older girls were more fond of me.</b>

941
00:32:42,639 --> 00:32:44,263
<b>It's so believable though.</b>

942
00:32:44,349 --> 00:32:45,450
<b>So now...</b>

943
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:48,250
<b>Yes, go ahead and predict where you would be on the ranking.</b>

944
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:50,250
<b>- Our own? - Yes, guess your own ranking.</b>

945
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:52,349
<b>Just know that we need to win this round.</b>

946
00:32:52,349 --> 00:32:54,242
<b>We have to guess our own ranking correctly.</b>

947
00:32:54,359 --> 00:32:56,930
<b>Most of us are probably high up.</b>

948
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:58,190
<b>We're high up in the ranking.</b>

949
00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:00,460
<b>- But... - Kwang Soo and I...</b>

950
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:02,159
<b>- Exactly. - We'll be low on the ranking.</b>

951
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,669
<b>Jae Seok could be high up in the ranking though...</b>

952
00:33:04,669 --> 00:33:05,869
<b>since he's funny.</b>

953
00:33:05,869 --> 00:33:07,440
<b>- Right? - The funny ones...</b>

954
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,899
<b>were popular in school.</b>

955
00:33:08,899 --> 00:33:11,540
<b>- I bet he's in the top three. - Let's start with Seok Jin.</b>

956
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:13,069
<b>I...</b>

957
00:33:13,069 --> 00:33:15,680
<b>- It's all about guessing correctly. - But Seok Jin's well-known,</b>

958
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,550
<b>- so... - In my case...</b>

959
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:20,050
<b>Our team needs to win, so I'll put myself in ninth place.</b>

960
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:22,020
<b>You think three are beneath you in the ranking?</b>

961
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,773
<b>- Eighth place? - To be honest,</b>

962
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:26,149
<b>I think you're probably in 10th place.</b>

963
00:33:26,149 --> 00:33:27,359
<b>Shut it.</b>

964
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:28,472
<b>(Mr. Popular explodes.)</b>

965
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,559
<b>- The choice is yours. - I was quite popular, you know.</b>

966
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:31,930
<b>Go with your gut then.</b>

967
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:34,658
<b>- I was popular with the ladies. - Go with your gut.</b>

968
00:33:34,659 --> 00:33:36,300
<b>- Follow your gut. - Okay.</b>

969
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,369
<b>(He trusts his gut...)</b>

970
00:33:37,369 --> 00:33:38,829
<b>(and puts himself in 7th place.)</b>

971
00:33:38,829 --> 00:33:41,152
<b>No, don't be like that!</b>

972
00:33:41,169 --> 00:33:43,669
<b>- His gut? - You told me to follow my gut!</b>

973
00:33:43,669 --> 00:33:45,869
<b>- I know I said that, but... - If I'm being honest,</b>

974
00:33:45,869 --> 00:33:47,280
<b>- this is where I should be. - Stop it.</b>

975
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,809
<b>- But your gut feeling is wrong! - This is what my gut is telling me.</b>

976
00:33:49,809 --> 00:33:51,409
<b>Add a splash of conscience too.</b>

977
00:33:51,409 --> 00:33:53,149
<b>- Exactly. - I'll add a lot of it.</b>

978
00:33:53,149 --> 00:33:54,449
<b>- Exactly. - Add some conscience.</b>

979
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:55,849
<b>- Okay! - Nice.</b>

980
00:33:55,849 --> 00:33:57,990
<b>- Happy now? - Yes, we're good.</b>

981
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:00,043
<b>- Okay, fine. - It's so that the team can win.</b>

982
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:02,919
<b>Ji Hyo, don't be too modest.</b>

983
00:34:02,919 --> 00:34:04,859
<b>- Ji Hyo... - Don't be modest.</b>

984
00:34:04,859 --> 00:34:07,659
<b>It only makes sense that you're high up in the ranking.</b>

985
00:34:07,659 --> 00:34:09,359
<b>What is your take on this?</b>

986
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:10,783
<b>- Me? - Yes.</b>

987
00:34:11,169 --> 00:34:13,152
<b>Just be honest with us.</b>

988
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:15,169
<b>First place?</b>

989
00:34:15,169 --> 00:34:16,910
<b>(1st place?)</b>

990
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:18,069
<b>Nice one!</b>

991
00:34:18,069 --> 00:34:19,870
<b>- Do it then. - Put yourself in first place.</b>

992
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:21,280
<b>- Go ahead. - You should.</b>

993
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,010
<b>- Go for first place. - Look how brazen you are.</b>

994
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:24,749
<b>I truly believe...</b>

995
00:34:24,749 --> 00:34:27,050
<b>- I'm in first place. - I love that about you.</b>

996
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:29,619
<b>You should do whatever you want regardless of what others think.</b>

997
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:31,649
<b>- No matter what others say... - Regardless?</b>

998
00:34:31,649 --> 00:34:32,720
<b>- Be yourself. - Go for it.</b>

999
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:33,990
<b>- First place. - Prettier kids...</b>

1000
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:36,272
<b>- were most popular in school. - Right.</b>

1001
00:34:36,359 --> 00:34:38,760
<b>So Min is probably high up on the ranking too.</b>

1002
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,959
<b>So Min, just follow your gut.</b>

1003
00:34:39,959 --> 00:34:42,530
<b>I think I could be in third place.</b>

1004
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:44,899
<b>(Laughing hysterically)</b>

1005
00:34:44,899 --> 00:34:47,269
<b>- Unbelievable. - Why are you laughing?</b>

1006
00:34:47,269 --> 00:34:49,569
<b>- I'm pretty, you know. - Yes, I know that.</b>

1007
00:34:49,569 --> 00:34:51,669
<b>(You're the only one who doesn't know.)</b>

1008
00:34:51,669 --> 00:34:53,209
<b>Can't I even laugh now?</b>

1009
00:34:53,209 --> 00:34:55,680
<b>- "I'm pretty, you know." - You never know though.</b>

1010
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:58,910
<b>So Min was adorable as a kid, so she was probably popular.</b>

1011
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:00,180
<b>- I agree. - Third place.</b>

1012
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:02,902
<b>- I bet you were popular. - Wouldn't second place be better?</b>

1013
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:06,249
<b>I think I could be higher in the ranking,</b>

1014
00:35:06,249 --> 00:35:08,060
<b>but I'll settle for this.</b>

1015
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:09,772
<b>Team Kwang Soo, you're up.</b>

1016
00:35:10,089 --> 00:35:12,143
<b>- This is a team game, guys. - We know.</b>

1017
00:35:12,189 --> 00:35:14,343
<b>Let us be objective, okay?</b>

1018
00:35:14,459 --> 00:35:16,883
<b>Personally, I believe in you.</b>

1019
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,069
<b>I bet you're in seconds place.</b>

1020
00:35:19,069 --> 00:35:21,439
<b>I was quite popular in school, you know.</b>

1021
00:35:21,439 --> 00:35:23,470
<b>- I bet you were. - You're tall so...</b>

1022
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:26,010
<b>- They're trying to fool you. - I liked to joke around too.</b>

1023
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:27,180
<b>This is a trap.</b>

1024
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:28,993
<b>Why would you think that way?</b>

1025
00:35:29,539 --> 00:35:31,249
<b>Because they think I should be high up?</b>

1026
00:35:31,249 --> 00:35:33,010
<b>Anyway, keep in mind that this is a team game.</b>

1027
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:34,879
<b>- You're in 2nd place. - 2nd place sounds good.</b>

1028
00:35:34,879 --> 00:35:36,819
<b>- Second place sounds good. - Where's your confidence?</b>

1029
00:35:36,819 --> 00:35:38,133
<b>Of course, you're in second place.</b>

1030
00:35:38,189 --> 00:35:39,519
<b>- Right? - Go for it.</b>

1031
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:40,919
<b>I'm not sure but...</b>

1032
00:35:40,919 --> 00:35:42,660
<b>You're in second place. Gosh.</b>

1033
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,060
<b>So what?</b>

1034
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,060
<b>I'm putting myself in second place.</b>

1035
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,459
<b>He's being ridiculous.</b>

1036
00:35:46,459 --> 00:35:48,913
<b>The team leader has no consideration for his team.</b>

1037
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:51,669
<b>There's no one in the lower rankings.</b>

1038
00:35:51,669 --> 00:35:53,030
<b>- First place. - Seong Wu.</b>

1039
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:55,370
<b>- First place! - Don't be modest.</b>

1040
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:56,953
<b>This isn't me being modest.</b>

1041
00:35:58,039 --> 00:36:01,910
<b>I just think that the members of Running Man...</b>

1042
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:04,133
<b>have a better chance to be higher up in the ranking.</b>

1043
00:36:04,149 --> 00:36:06,010
<b>- What? - No way!</b>

1044
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:09,203
<b>If that's the case, you'll be in ninth place.</b>

1045
00:36:09,649 --> 00:36:11,089
<b>- We're a group of eight. - Not all of them.</b>

1046
00:36:11,089 --> 00:36:12,732
<b>- Is that so? - Seok Jin.</b>

1047
00:36:12,789 --> 00:36:14,160
<b>Not you.</b>

1048
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,359
<b>- Not you. - Quietly but firmly...</b>

1049
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:18,013
<b>I still think I'm better looking than some of you.</b>

1050
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:19,060
<b>So not me, then.</b>

1051
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,359
<b>- I'm loving your style. - Nice one.</b>

1052
00:36:20,359 --> 00:36:21,459
<b>That's him being modest too.</b>

1053
00:36:21,459 --> 00:36:23,343
<b>You could be right though.</b>

1054
00:36:23,669 --> 00:36:25,100
<b>Don't forget that you played basketball.</b>

1055
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,039
<b>- He was actually popular in school. - Right.</b>

1056
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:29,039
<b>Do Hyun, just think about how you really were.</b>

1057
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:32,269
<b>People don't approach me easily though...</b>

1058
00:36:32,269 --> 00:36:36,039
<b>because they find me to be quite cold at first.</b>

1059
00:36:36,039 --> 00:36:38,249
<b>- So I wasn't... - What's your estimate ranking?</b>

1060
00:36:38,249 --> 00:36:41,163
<b>Well, about 4th or 5th place?</b>

1061
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:43,419
<b>That high up when you think you weren't popular?</b>

1062
00:36:43,419 --> 00:36:45,850
<b>- Unbelievable. - Are you kidding me?</b>

1063

<b>It's right for popular kids to say that.</b>

<b>- He's not like us. - "About 4th or 5th?"</b>

<b>Unbelievable.</b>

1066
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:53,760
<b>If we started off by saying that,</b>

1067

<b>we would've said "below ninth."</b>

1068
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,260
<b>I'll go for fourth place.</b>

1069
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,569
<b>Sure, fourth place.</b>

1070
00:36:57,569 --> 00:36:58,970
<b>All right.</b>

1071
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:00,569
<b>- Good one. - How modest.</b>

1072
00:37:00,569 --> 00:37:01,970
<b>ZICO, you're next.</b>

1073
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,039
<b>I think you'll be in first place.</b>

1074

<b>ZICO's song has been trending these days.</b>

1075

<b>I'm sure everyone has heard "Any Song" by now.</b>

1076

<b>- Then... - It's third place for me.</b>

1077
00:37:10,479 --> 00:37:11,609
<b>- Third place? - Yes.</b>

1078
00:37:11,609 --> 00:37:13,280
<b>People will criticize Kwang Soo now.</b>

1079

<b>You said you expected to be high up.</b>

1080
00:37:15,419 --> 00:37:18,450
<b>I can't believe you threw me under the bus like this.</b>

1081

<b>- But you're our team leader. - What?</b>

1082
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:23,143
<b>- You're our team leader. - You're the worst, you know.</b>

1083
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,942
<b>- Se Chan's up. - He doesn't have much of a choice.</b>

1084
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:27,530
<b>I'm definitely higher up than Seok Jin.</b>

1085
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:29,300
<b>- So eighth place. - He should be beneath me.</b>

1086
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,269
<b>His estimate isn't modest at all.</b>

1087

<b>- Go for 8th place. - Yes, 8th place.</b>

00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:34,652
<b>- Right. - It's not so bad.</b>

1089
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,383

<b>You should never be arrogant.</b>

<b>- Do Hyun is so funny. - You should be humble.</b>

1130

<b>Let me explain.</b>

1131
00:38:49,939 --> 00:38:52,593
<b>People in their 20s cast the most votes for ZICO.</b>

<b>- I knew it. - But all the other age groups...</b>

<b>- Ji Hyo, you're incredible. - Ji Hyo is strong.</b>

1135

<b>Also, all the age groups cast the fewest votes for Seok Jin.</b>

1136

<b>(Seok Jin got the fewest votes from all the age groups.)</b>

1137

<b>You're below me.</b>

1138

<b>I understand that.</b>

1139
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:08,430
<b>- They don't know what I was like. - He's angry.</b>

<b>That's understandable.</b>

1141

<b>Okay, I get it now. So this is how it works.</b>

1142
00:39:11,269 --> 00:39:12,499
<b>I get it now.</b>

1143

<b>Here's the second question.</b>

<b>- Wait. - This question...</b>

1148
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:24,649
<b>For this question,</b>

1149
00:39:24,649 --> 00:39:26,393
<b>- I'll definitely be near the top. - I will be in the lower ranks.</b>

1150
00:39:26,479 --> 00:39:28,319
<b>So fun people are supposed to be at the bottom, right?</b>

1151
00:39:28,319 --> 00:39:30,120
<b>What are you guys like? Kwang Soo.</b>

<b>What do you do at clubs?</b>

1153

<b>I'm kind of tall,</b>

1154

<b>so I attract a lot of attention.</b>

1155
00:39:35,819 --> 00:39:36,990
<b>So what exactly do you do?</b>

1156

<b>Around me...</b>

1157

<b>You're pretentious and frivolous?</b>

<b>"That guy is wearing such strong perfume."</b>

00:46:55,959 --> 00:46:57,229
<b>He's so cool about it.</b>

1364
00:46:57,229 --> 00:46:58,330
<b>(He swallows his pride to win a prize.)</b>

1365
00:46:58,330 --> 00:46:59,769
<b>You're in 12th place.</b>

1366
00:46:59,769 --> 00:47:01,499
<b>- You're in 12th place. - I don't go to clubs a lot.</b>

1367
00:47:01,499 --> 00:47:02,700
<b>- We know that. - We know that.</b>

1368
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:04,493
<b>It's just about having a fun image.</b>

1369
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:06,769
<b>- I have no choice. - With "Any Song"...</b>

1370
00:47:06,769 --> 00:47:07,910
<b>- That's a good choice. - Well done.</b>

1371
00:47:07,910 --> 00:47:09,363
<b>"Any Song" is so popular.</b>

1372
00:47:10,109 --> 00:47:13,863
<b>(Who would be the most boring at clubs?)</b>

1373
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:15,933
<b>- We have a good chance of winning. - Will this hurt?</b>

1374
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:18,502
<b>Let's win this. Let's do this.</b>

1375
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:20,332
<b>Let me reveal the result.</b>

1376
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,542
<b>1, 2, 3.</b>

1377

<b>(What's the result?)</b>

1378
00:47:26,530 --> 00:47:27,743
<b>We win again!</b>

1379
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:31,999
<b>(Team Lee Kwang Soo is the final winner.)</b>

1380
00:47:31,999 --> 00:47:33,899
<b>- Let's see the result. - You got it right.</b>

1381
00:47:33,899 --> 00:47:35,269
<b>We lose again? Why?</b>

1382
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:36,939
<b>- Why did we lose? - Why?</b>

1383
00:47:36,939 --> 00:47:38,109
<b>Let's see the result.</b>

1384
00:47:38,109 --> 00:47:39,609
<b>- What is that? - I got it right.</b>

1385
00:47:39,609 --> 00:47:40,879
<b>- I got it right too. - I got it right.</b>

1386
00:47:40,879 --> 00:47:42,993
<b>(The correct ranking)</b>

1387
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:46,749
<b>(3 members of Team Lee Kwang Soo got their places right...)</b>

1388
00:47:46,749 --> 00:47:48,203
<b>(while no member of Team Jee Seok Jin got it right.)</b>

1389
00:47:48,879 --> 00:47:50,450
<b>- Do Hyun really is in 2nd place. - I got it right.</b>

1390
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:51,519
<b>He's in 2nd place?</b>

1391
00:47:51,519 --> 00:47:52,950
<b>Hey, you're in 2nd place.</b>

1392
00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:54,402
<b>(Do I look so boring?)</b>

1393
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:56,819
<b>Is that my image?</b>

1394
00:47:56,819 --> 00:47:58,530
<b>Haha placed 11th.</b>

1395
00:47:58,530 --> 00:48:02,513
<b>Haha, only a few people think you are like Sean.</b>

1396
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:05,530
<b>Only your close friends think that.</b>

1397
00:48:05,530 --> 00:48:06,700
<b>(Only his close friends think he is a loving husband.)</b>

1398
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:07,999
<b>What do you mean Haha is like Sean?</b>

1399
00:48:07,999 --> 00:48:09,700
<b>He said his image is like that of Sean.</b>

1400
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:10,922
<b>What kind of nonsense is that?</b>

1401
00:48:10,939 --> 00:48:12,209
<b>- Seriously. - That's ridiculous.</b>

1402
00:48:12,209 --> 00:48:13,839
<b>- Only my close friends think that. - That's right.</b>

1403
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:16,192
<b>- The public doesn't know that. - No, it doesn't.</b>

1404
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,709
<b>Thus, Team Lee Kwang Soo won.</b>

1405
00:48:19,709 --> 00:48:21,249
<b>(Team Lee Kwang Soo won the 2nd round.)</b>

1406
00:48:21,249 --> 00:48:22,602
<b>Yes!</b>

1407
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:24,319
<b>Team Lee Kwang Soo will submit 15 R coins...</b>

1408

<b>and Team Jee Seok Jin will submit 20 R coins.</b>

1409
00:48:27,819 --> 00:48:29,859
<b>- Se Chan, go first. - Shall I go first?</b>

1410
00:48:29,859 --> 00:48:31,089
<b>- Okay. - Shall we go in this order?</b>

1411
00:48:31,089 --> 00:48:33,042
<b>I know Se Chan will make the right choice.</b>

1412
00:48:33,189 --> 00:48:35,530
<b>Gosh, I didn't want to go first.</b>

1413
00:48:35,530 --> 00:48:37,030
<b>(The first person's choice will affect everyone who follows.)</b>

1414
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:39,712
<b>(What will be Se Chan's choice?)</b>

1415
00:48:39,999 --> 00:48:41,069
<b>- You are done, right? - I am done.</b>

1416
00:48:41,069 --> 00:48:42,800
<b>- ZICO, go right ahead. - Okay.</b>

1417
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,553
<b>ZICO, I don't doubt you.</b>

1418
00:48:47,069 --> 00:48:51,192
<b>(Will ZICO remain loyal?)</b>

1419
00:48:53,149 --> 00:48:55,933
<b>Look at Ji Hun. He is taking out R coins as he goes.</b>

1420
00:48:56,249 --> 00:48:57,519
<b>People who pay up are different.</b>

1421
00:48:57,519 --> 00:49:01,542
<b>(Seong Wu submits R coins last.)</b>

1422
00:49:03,289 --> 00:49:04,573
<b>(My goodness.)</b>

1423
00:49:05,189 --> 00:49:06,660
<b>- How many were there? - How many did you submit?</b>

1424
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:08,129
<b>How many did you submit?</b>

1425
00:49:08,129 --> 00:49:09,129
<b>What is it, Seong Wu?</b>

1426
00:49:09,129 --> 00:49:11,069
<b>- Go, Kwang Soo. - I don't doubt you guys.</b>

1427
00:49:11,069 --> 00:49:12,129
<b>(Is Seong Wu shocked due to the number of R coins?)</b>

1428
00:49:12,129 --> 00:49:13,283
<b>If you didn't pay up...</b>

1429
00:49:13,870 --> 00:49:16,383
<b>I... Kwang Soo.</b>

1430
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,453
<b>I had no choice.</b>

1431
00:49:19,209 --> 00:49:21,093
<b>- I had no choice either. - I...</b>

1432
00:49:21,879 --> 00:49:25,109
<b>(It's time to check the number of submitted R coins.)</b>

1433
00:49:25,109 --> 00:49:26,450
<b>(The current number of R coins)</b>

1434
00:49:26,450 --> 00:49:28,933
<b>(Only 1)</b>

1435
00:49:29,979 --> 00:49:31,672
<b>You jerks!</b>

1436
00:49:32,589 --> 00:49:34,789
<b>(He gives an angry shout.)</b>

1437
00:49:34,789 --> 00:49:35,990
<b>That startled me. What is it?</b>

1438
00:49:35,990 --> 00:49:37,743
<b>Let's break off the team.</b>

1439
00:49:37,830 --> 00:49:39,959
<b>- Why? What is it like? - What is it like?</b>

1440
00:49:39,959 --> 00:49:41,183
<b>You know,</b>

1441
00:49:41,330 --> 00:49:42,800
<b>this number is ridiculous.</b>

1442
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:43,982
<b>(We aren't a team.)</b>

1443
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:48,053
<b>Failing to catch the traitor would be harder.</b>

1444
00:49:48,499 --> 00:49:50,883
<b>- I will catch the traitor. - How many R coins are there?</b>

1445
00:49:50,910 --> 00:49:53,022
<b>- Four? - Shut it!</b>

1446
00:49:53,339 --> 00:49:54,910
<b>We aren't a team.</b>

1447
00:49:54,910 --> 00:49:56,080
<b>(He is seething due to the shocking result.)</b>

1448
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:58,748
<b>- I can't believe them. - Well done.</b>

1449
00:49:58,749 --> 00:49:59,979
<b>- What a twist! - Catch the traitor.</b>

1450
00:49:59,979 --> 00:50:02,220
<b>Will you pay for everything or catch the member who paid less?</b>

1451
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:03,332
<b>I will catch the traitor.</b>

1452
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:05,249
<b>- I will catch the traitor. - Please pick one.</b>

1453
00:50:05,249 --> 00:50:06,249
<b>(4 out of 5 members submitted 0 R coins.)</b>

1454
00:50:06,249 --> 00:50:08,289
<b>There are so many suspects.</b>

1455
00:50:08,289 --> 00:50:09,419
<b>I guess someone submitted zero R coins.</b>

1456
00:50:09,419 --> 00:50:11,689
<b>I think the lowest number is either 1 or 0.</b>

1457
00:50:11,689 --> 00:50:14,712
<b>I will let you defend yourself one last time.</b>

1458
00:50:15,129 --> 00:50:17,042
<b>I know how many coins Se Chan submitted.</b>

1459
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,312
<b>- ZICO could be lying. - So...</b>

1460
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:24,053
<b>I submitted as much as Se Chan did.</b>

1461
00:50:24,609 --> 00:50:26,140
<b>(You little...)</b>

1462
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:27,252
<b>Don't curse!</b>

1463
00:50:27,439 --> 00:50:28,810
<b>(A sense of betrayal makes him curse.)</b>

1464
00:50:28,810 --> 00:50:29,879
<b>Don't curse!</b>

1465
00:50:29,879 --> 00:50:31,910
<b>There are two loaches!</b>

1466
00:50:31,910 --> 00:50:33,910
<b>I am sorry. I am sorry.</b>

1467
00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:35,163
<b>- That's not true. - Hey!</b>

1468
00:50:36,019 --> 00:50:38,133
<b>- My goodness. - Don't let him fool you.</b>

1469
00:50:38,189 --> 00:50:40,732
<b>Listen, Kwang Soo. Earlier...</b>

1470
00:50:41,019 --> 00:50:43,372
<b>- Do Hyun. - We started off on the wrong foot.</b>

1471
00:50:43,589 --> 00:50:45,359
<b>- You know what I mean, right? - For goodness' sake.</b>

1472
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:46,442
<b>What did you do?</b>

1473
00:50:46,459 --> 00:50:49,600
<b>I had no choice but to follow.</b>

1474
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:51,200
<b>(Kwang Soo is speechless.)</b>

1475
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,529
<b>- And... - How many coins are there in total?</b>

1476
00:50:53,530 --> 00:50:56,370
<b>And I saw the need to get back on the right track.</b>

1477
00:50:56,370 --> 00:50:58,410
<b>- So you... - You have an idea now, right?</b>

1478
00:50:58,410 --> 00:50:59,993
<b>- Are you saying you paid up? - Yes.</b>

1479
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:03,039
<b>- How many coins did you pay up? - I can't tell you that.</b>

1480
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:05,479
<b>How many coins did you pay up? Tell me honestly.</b>

1481
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:06,593
<b>No.</b>

1482
00:51:07,749 --> 00:51:08,933
<b>Tell me!</b>

1483
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:10,863
<b>- Tell me! How many coins? - I can't tell you.</b>

1484
00:51:11,089 --> 00:51:13,473
<b>I see why your mom grabbed you by your hair.</b>

1485
00:51:14,289 --> 00:51:16,803
<b>- I see why your mom did it. - I can't tell you.</b>

1486
00:51:17,089 --> 00:51:18,990
<b>Seong Wu can't even laugh comfortably.</b>

1487
00:51:18,990 --> 00:51:21,229
<b>- I am... - I know. He is nervous.</b>

1488
00:51:21,229 --> 00:51:24,553
<b>the first person...</b>

1489
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,283
<b>who didn't follow the wrong trend.</b>

1490
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:29,122
<b>- You are saying you paid up. - Yes.</b>

1491
00:51:30,470 --> 00:51:31,970
<b>- He is trying his best to survive. - Seong Wu submitted two coins.</b>

1492
00:51:31,970 --> 00:51:33,010
<b>Really?</b>

1493
00:51:33,010 --> 00:51:35,539
<b>My guess is 0, 0, 1, 1, and 2 coins. Did I get it right?</b>

1494
00:51:35,539 --> 00:51:38,232
<b>- The wrong trend... - You are close.</b>

1495
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:40,209
<b>- Did I get it right? - Kwang Soo looks upset.</b>

1496
00:51:40,209 --> 00:51:41,519
<b>No, no. That can't be right.</b>

1497
00:51:41,519 --> 00:51:44,033
<b>I wouldn't be so angry if that's the case.</b>

1498
00:51:44,950 --> 00:51:46,990
<b>- Is it worse? - Is it worse?</b>

1499
00:51:46,990 --> 00:51:49,243
<b>- My goodness. - Is it worse?</b>

1500
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:52,160
<b>Then you should pick anyone.</b>

1501
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,789
<b>He should just pick one of them.</b>

1502
00:51:53,789 --> 00:51:55,129
<b>(Failing to catch the traitor would be harder.)</b>

1503
00:51:55,129 --> 00:51:56,783
<b>This isn't a team. For goodness' sake.</b>

1504
00:51:57,999 --> 00:52:00,499
<b>I will pick 1 of these 3.</b>

1505
00:52:00,499 --> 00:52:02,122
<b>- Okay. - One of us?</b>

1506
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:03,769
<b>I told you that we started off on the wrong foot.</b>

1507
00:52:03,769 --> 00:52:05,240
<b>- Don't be ridiculous. - You started off on the wrong foot?</b>

1508
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:07,422
<b>Tell me how many coins you submitted and I won't pick you.</b>

1509
00:52:07,879 --> 00:52:09,479
<b>- How many coins? - I will whisper it in your ear.</b>

1510
00:52:09,479 --> 00:52:10,823
<b>I don't want the others to know.</b>

00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,310
<b>He can lie, so it doesn't matter.</b>

1512
00:52:13,310 --> 00:52:16,350
<b>I pick Do Hyun.</b>

1513
00:52:16,350 --> 00:52:18,272
<b>(My goodness.)</b>

1514
00:52:18,749 --> 00:52:19,902
<b>I pick Do Hyun.</b>

1515
00:52:20,149 --> 00:52:21,743
<b>- It's you. - Why do you think that?</b>

1516
00:52:21,859 --> 00:52:24,319
<b>What he whispered in my ear makes no sense.</b>

1517
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:25,442
<b>It's you.</b>

1518
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:27,143
<b>- It's you. I pick Do Hyun. - But...</b>

1519

<b>- we started off on the wrong foot. - Do Hyun.</b>

1520

<b>Kwang Soo,</b>

1521
00:52:30,530 --> 00:52:31,530
<b>(Will Kwang Soo succeed to apprehend the traitor?)</b>

00:52:31,530 --> 00:52:32,700
<b>you have...</b>

1523
00:52:32,701 --> 00:52:34,784
<b>(Will Kwang Soo succeed to apprehend the traitor?)</b>

1524
00:52:36,919 --> 00:52:39,820
<b>- successfully picked your traitor. - Okay!</b>

1525
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:41,160
<b>(Sighing)</b>

1526
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:42,590
<b>- You... - Se Chan!</b>

1527

<b>- Seriously. - You shouldn't be that way!</b>

1528
00:52:43,990 --> 00:52:45,729
<b>- What are you talking about? - You shouldn't be that way!</b>

1529
00:52:45,729 --> 00:52:46,789
<b>Do Hyun,</b>

<b>It annoyed me that he lied.</b>

1532

<b>Everyone submitted zero coins.</b>

1533
00:52:54,039 --> 00:52:55,452
<b>- For goodness' sake. - Go.</b>

1534
00:52:56,099 --> 00:52:59,022
<b>(Since Do Hyun has been apprehended as the traitor,)</b>

1535

<b>(he submits 14 R coins.)</b>

<b>(Seong Wu was the person who submitted 1 R coin.)</b>

<b>Ji Hyo should go first.</b>

1539

<b>We need to start off on the right foot.</b>

1540
00:53:10,150 --> 00:53:11,249
<b>- Ji Hyo, can you pay two R coins? - I will...</b>

1541
00:53:11,249 --> 00:53:12,403
<b>- I will do that. - Let's do this right.</b>

1542
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:13,889
<b>(They submit R coins in turn.)</b>

1543
00:53:13,889 --> 00:53:15,872
<b>- Our total was 1 R coin. - 1 R coin.</b>

1544
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:19,189
<b>(There are 8 R coins in total.)</b>

1545
00:53:19,189 --> 00:53:21,082
<b>Is this a family?</b>

1546
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:22,713
<b>Okay.</b>

<b>(Seok Jin picks Haha.)</b>

1550

<b>Seo Jin, you have...</b>

1551
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:31,309
<b>- succeeded. - All right.</b>

1552
00:53:31,309 --> 00:53:33,610
<b>Haha, pay up the rest of the R coins.</b>

1553

<b>(Haha had submitted 0 R coins. He pays up 12 R coins.)</b>

<b>(Team Lee Kwang Soo and Team Jee Seok Jin)</b>

<b>The last mission which gives you a chance to win more R coins is...</b>

1557

<b>Trust the Piggy Banks.</b>

1558
00:53:45,349 --> 00:53:46,533
<b>(Trust the Piggy Banks)</b>

1559
00:53:46,550 --> 00:53:48,360
<b>You will play Name Tag Elimination for a limited amount of time.</b>

1560
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:49,519
<b>(They will play Name Tag Elimination for 30 minutes.)</b>

1561
00:53:49,519 --> 00:53:51,573
<b>A team member can win R coins...</b>

1562
00:53:51,659 --> 00:53:53,543
<b>by removing the other team's name tags...</b>

<b>To the center.</b>

1566
00:53:59,429 --> 00:54:02,340
<b>All coins will be submitted to the center,</b>

1567

<b>but the center can't put them in the piggy banks.</b>

1568
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:08,762
<b>The 12 members' piggy banks will be in the centers' room.</b>

1569
00:54:09,210 --> 00:54:12,550
<b>The centers must distribute coins to the members.</b>

1570
00:54:12,550 --> 00:54:14,250
<b>Then those members will enter the room...</b>

1571
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:16,233
<b>and put the coins in the piggy banks of their choice.</b>

1572
00:54:17,019 --> 00:54:18,989
<b>- I need to trust the team members. - Seriously.</b>

1573
00:54:18,989 --> 00:54:21,389
<b>Are you out if your name tag gets ripped off?</b>

1574
00:54:21,389 --> 00:54:23,202
<b>- You keep playing. - I see.</b>

1575
00:54:23,519 --> 00:54:25,289
<b>The center can also win coins...</b>

<b>in the centers' room through a separate mission.</b>

1577
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,199
<b>Okay. I got it.</b>

1578
00:54:30,199 --> 00:54:32,052
<b>- Let's start the race. - Let's go.</b>

1579
00:54:32,369 --> 00:54:33,753
<b>We need to win as a team.</b>

1580
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,570
<b>(Team Jee Seok Jin has 30 coins, Team Lee Kwang Soo has 43 coins.)</b>

1581
00:54:36,570 --> 00:54:37,570
<b>I need to beat Kwang Soo.</b>

1582

<b>I think I am losing.</b>

1583
00:54:40,039 --> 00:54:42,463
<b>- That's right. I am winning. - But I have Jae Seok and Jong Kook.</b>

1584
00:54:42,639 --> 00:54:43,710
<b>They are good at...</b>

1585
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:44,809
<b>- Name Tag Elimination. - That's right.</b>

1586
00:54:44,809 --> 00:54:46,093
<b>Once they bring me name tags...</b>

1587
00:54:46,409 --> 00:54:49,280
<b>Should I put my interest first?</b>

1588
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:50,972
<b>Should I put the team's interest first?</b>

1589
00:54:51,050 --> 00:54:52,420
<b>That's the question.</b>

1590
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:53,489
<b>(You can avoid the penalty if you have a lot of R coins.)</b>

1591
00:54:53,489 --> 00:54:56,443
<b>Okay. In this round, I plan to put the team's interest first.</b>

1592
00:54:56,860 --> 00:54:58,289
<b>I should focus on...</b>

1593

<b>finding the hidden name tags.</b>

1594
00:55:00,090 --> 00:55:02,383
<b>Everyone on that team must be stronger than me.</b>

1595
00:55:03,059 --> 00:55:05,552
<b>I will yank off the name tag of anyone I meet.</b>

1596
00:55:06,230 --> 00:55:08,352
<b>So Min, Ji Hyo...</b>

1597
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:12,753
<b>I could find my teammates' name tags...</b>

1598
00:55:13,409 --> 00:55:15,162
<b>and sell them for two coins each...</b>

1599
00:55:15,179 --> 00:55:16,710
<b>- to the other team. - You could do that.</b>

1600
00:55:16,710 --> 00:55:19,293
<b>(Betrayal is engraved on his DNA.)</b>

1601
00:55:19,550 --> 00:55:21,463

1608
00:55:29,619 --> 00:55:30,903
<b>Shall I go?</b>

1609
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:32,760
<b>(The race starts!)</b>

1610
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:34,383
<b>The race starts.</b>

1611
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:36,843
<b>- Did it start already? - It started.</b>

1612
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,599
<b>The two of you will have a quiz.</b>

1613
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:40,630
<b>A quiz?</b>

1614
00:55:40,630 --> 00:55:42,599
<b>- Listen to the question. - I think I have an advantage.</b>

1615
00:55:42,599 --> 00:55:44,039
<b>You never know if I do this seriously.</b>

1616
00:55:44,039 --> 00:55:46,809
<b>The center who answers the question correctly first...</b>

1617
00:55:46,809 --> 00:55:50,710
<b>- will get 1 coin from the other. - 1 coin.</b>

1618
00:55:50,710 --> 00:55:53,809
<b>The coins you get from the members as well as the quiz...</b>

1619
00:55:53,809 --> 00:55:56,449
<b>need to go into the piggy banks.</b>

1620
00:55:56,449 --> 00:55:59,090
<b>So I need to give them to my team members.</b>

1621
00:55:59,090 --> 00:56:01,173
<b>I should save up the coins...</b>

1622
00:56:01,219 --> 00:56:02,219
<b>and give them at once.</b>

1623
00:56:02,219 --> 00:56:03,360
<b>Who do you trust the most?</b>

1624
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,159
<b>I trust Jong Kook the most.</b>

1625
00:56:05,159 --> 00:56:07,558
<b>He doesn't lie to your face.</b>

1626
00:56:07,559 --> 00:56:09,343
<b>I don't trust anyone but Seong Wu.</b>

1627
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:12,552
<b>Your team is the absolute worst.</b>

1628
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:14,900
<b>Here comes the first question.</b>

1629
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:18,253
<b>- Jae Seok has a son, right? - Yes.</b>

1630
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:21,409
<b>When is Yu Ji Ho's birthday?</b>

1631

<b>(When is Yu Ji Ho's birthday?)</b>

1632
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:25,992
<b>(What kind of a question is this?)</b>

1633
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:28,262
<b>(Flustered)</b>

1634
00:56:28,550 --> 00:56:30,349
<b>Do you think we are Jae Seok's slaves?</b>

1635
00:56:30,349 --> 00:56:31,449
<b>(The ridiculous question disheartens them.)</b>

1636
00:56:31,449 --> 00:56:32,903
<b>This is driving me crazy.</b>

1637

<b>(Meanwhile, Jae Seok is looking for name tags.)</b>

1638

<b>(ZICO spots Jae Seok...)</b>

1639
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:39,659
<b>I spotted him.</b>

1640
00:56:39,659 --> 00:56:41,182
<b>(and begins to chase after him.)</b>

1641
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:43,960
<b>(Jae Seok is unsuspecting.)</b>

1642

<b>- We need to find name tags. - I know.</b>

1643

<b>- Where can they hide... - ZICO is behind you.</b>

1644

<b>(He stops abruptly.)</b>

1645
00:56:52,010 --> 00:56:54,070
<b>(He sees Jong Kook too late.)</b>

1646
00:56:54,070 --> 00:56:56,023
<b>ZICO is behind you.</b>

1647

<b>(He's shocked.)</b>

1648

<b>- Wait for me. - Goodness.</b>

1649
00:56:59,610 --> 00:57:01,380
<b>(The tables are turned.)</b>

1650

<b>- This is so scary. - Come here.</b>

1651
00:57:03,619 --> 00:57:06,133
<b>- I'm so scared. - Come.</b>

1652
00:57:06,889 --> 00:57:08,460
<b>What do I do?</b>

1653
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:10,343
<b>I'm sorry, ZICO.</b>

1654
00:57:11,130 --> 00:57:12,159
<b>No.</b>

1655
00:57:12,159 --> 00:57:13,960
<b>- Rip it off. - Don't.</b>

1656
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:16,400
<b>We started less than five minutes ago.</b>

1657

<b>- Sorry. - No.</b>

1661

<b>He's so funny.</b>

1662

<b>He ran up from behind to rip off my name tag,</b>

1663
00:57:28,309 --> 00:57:30,423
<b>and then he was petrified when he saw you.</b>

1664
00:57:31,079 --> 00:57:32,710
<b>(He didn't see Jong Kook.)</b>

1665
00:57:32,710 --> 00:57:34,480
<b>You had no idea ZICO was there.</b>

1666
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:37,989
<b>- I had no idea. - He came up so fast.</b>

1667
00:57:37,989 --> 00:57:39,889
<b>You had no idea ZICO was there.</b>

1668
00:57:39,889 --> 00:57:40,889
<b>(So Min takes the name tag and runs away.)</b>

1669
00:57:40,889 --> 00:57:42,343
<b>It's my lucky day!</b>

1670
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:45,173
<b>I got lucky. Thanks, Jong Kook.</b>

1671
00:57:45,659 --> 00:57:47,030
<b>I have to answer this before Jae Seok gets here.</b>

1672
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:48,559
<b>Let's go for it. Let me answer.</b>

1673
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:50,559
<b>- August 2... - I'm here.</b>

1674
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:52,070
<b>- You're here? - You're here already?</b>

1675
00:57:52,070 --> 00:57:53,670
<b>(So Min arrives at the centers' room.)</b>

1676
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:55,253
<b>Hey.</b>

1677
00:57:55,269 --> 00:57:56,300
<b>(Nice, So Min.)</b>

1678
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:57,468
<b>Good job.</b>

1679
00:57:57,469 --> 00:58:00,869
<b>- Did you rip ZICO's name tag? - No, I was there at the right time.</b>

1680
00:58:00,869 --> 00:58:02,063
<b>Anyhow,</b>

1681
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:03,239
<b>this is the first one.</b>

1682
00:58:03,239 --> 00:58:06,250
<b>So Min, I'll give you coins for the name tag.</b>

1683
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:07,679
<b>- Thank you. How many are there? - Is it three?</b>

1684
00:58:07,679 --> 00:58:10,249
<b>That's it? Only three?</b>

1685
00:58:10,250 --> 00:58:12,690
<b>If we get Ji Ho's birthday right, we get one.</b>

1686
00:58:12,690 --> 00:58:14,820
<b>If he doesn't get the question right, do we lose this?</b>

1687
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:15,989
<b>- No. - It's not like that.</b>

1688
00:58:15,989 --> 00:58:18,059
<b>- We keep this. Wait. - Okay.</b>

1689
00:58:18,059 --> 00:58:19,558
<b>Get back out there for now.</b>

1690
00:58:19,559 --> 00:58:20,690
<b>- Do I leave? - Good job.</b>

1691
00:58:20,690 --> 00:58:22,559
<b>No, I should put them away.</b>

1692
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:24,059
<b>No, we'll collect them first.</b>

1693
00:58:24,059 --> 00:58:25,599
<b>- No. - No.</b>

1694
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:28,383
<b>10 seconds ago, he said he'll never give them to you.</b>

1695
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:29,900
<b>That's not true. Our team has to win.</b>

1696
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:31,710
<b>He doesn't trust you or Haha.</b>

1697
00:58:31,710 --> 00:58:32,969
<b>- That's not true. - No.</b>

1698
00:58:32,969 --> 00:58:34,780
<b>- Leave. Our team has to win. - I have to check.</b>

1699
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:36,309
<b>- It's for the team. - Keep playing.</b>

1700

<b>Let me answer. August 22.</b>

1701

<b>(August 22 is incorrect.)</b>

1702

<b>- How am I supposed to know? - What's the question?</b>

1703
00:58:42,550 --> 00:58:43,662
<b>Let me answer.</b>

1704
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:45,050

<b>(Striking)</b>

<b>You didn't hit me earlier.</b>

1711

<b>(My answer was incorrect.)</b>

1712

<b>(Ji Ho's birthday is the question?)</b>

1713

<b>You lost your chance.</b>

<b>I'm right. It was the password.</b>

1717

<b>- Let me answer. - Seok Jin.</b>

<b>(correct.)</b>

1723
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:20,432
<b>You're correct.</b>

1724
00:59:21,289 --> 00:59:22,489
<b>(He picked up Haha's answer.)</b>

<b>Continue your activities. Why are you being lazy?</b>

<b>Get the name tags.</b>

1733
00:59:37,170 --> 00:59:40,139
<b>So I work like a dog and give him the coins?</b>

1734
00:59:40,139 --> 00:59:41,940
<b>That's up to the centers.</b>

1735

<b>This isn't looking good.</b>

1738

<b>What's my team doing?</b>

1739
00:59:51,449 --> 00:59:53,872
<b>(ZICO is looking for another chance.)</b>

1740

<b>That scared me. She's pink.</b>

<b>(He starts attacking.)</b>

<b>Get him.</b>

1751

<b>Please, Jong Kook. Please.</b>

<b>- Do you... - You have another one?</b>

1765

<b>How many times did ZICO get his name tag ripped?</b>

1766

<b>ZICO and Ji Hun.</b>

1767

<b>What's he doing?</b>

1768

<b>(What on earth are these two doing?)</b>

1769
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:56,963
<b>Why does ZICO keep getting eliminated?</b>

1770
01:00:57,019 --> 01:00:59,288
<b>Give me some, and you can take this.</b>

1771

<b>(2 for the captain and 1 for each of them)</b>

<b>- Did you hear that? - I did.</b>

1776
01:01:08,530 --> 01:01:10,512
<b>We almost caught up.</b>

1777
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:12,329
<b>What's my team doing?</b>

<b>Over there!</b>

1781
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:20,109

<b>Over there!</b>

1783

<b>He's strong.</b>

1785

<b>- Don't come. - Get him.</b>

1786

<b>- Rip his name tag off. - Go.</b>

1787
01:01:28,579 --> 01:01:30,980
<b>- Get his name tag. - Don't do it.</b>

1788

<b>- Sorry. - Rip off Seong Wu's name tag.</b>

01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:42,313
<b>Sorry.</b>

1794

<b>Just hide!</b>

1811

<b>I'm running away.</b>

1819
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:37,932
<b>Do you think you can get my name tag?</b>

1820

<b>- Sorry? - If we wanted to.</b>

1821

<b>Sure. Okay.</b>

1945
01:06:28,619 --> 01:06:30,233
<b>(I like this guy.)</b>

<b>(Meanwhile, Jong Kook is looking for name tags.)</b>

1968
01:07:15,659 --> 01:07:17,012
<b>Where could they be?</b>

1969
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:19,329
<b>(Trailing behind him...)</b>

1970
01:07:19,329 --> 01:07:22,383
<b>(is Do Hyun.)</b>

1971
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,409
<b>(He holds his breath...)</b>

1972
01:07:25,409 --> 01:07:28,122
<b>(and chases after Jong Kook!)</b>

1973
01:07:28,780 --> 01:07:30,010
<b>(Waiting for his chance)</b>

1974
01:07:30,010 --> 01:07:32,079
<b>They used to hide name tags in here.</b>

1975
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:34,380
<b>(Jong Kook was looking for name tags...)</b>

1976
01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:35,633
<b>My goodness.</b>

1977
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:38,602
<b>(when he spots Do Hyun.)</b>

1978
01:07:38,820 --> 01:07:40,432
<b>I didn't expect you to look back.</b>

1979
01:07:41,250 --> 01:07:43,142
<b>You should have walked over faster.</b>

1980
01:07:43,659 --> 01:07:45,489
<b>You grew up watching Running Man, right?</b>

1981
01:07:45,489 --> 01:07:46,773
<b>Of course.</b>

1982
01:07:47,159 --> 01:07:48,742
<b>- You are the tiger. - Let me help you feel...</b>

1983
01:07:49,159 --> 01:07:50,543
<b>what it's like.</b>

1984
01:07:51,630 --> 01:07:53,512
<b>(Please spare me.)</b>

1985
01:07:54,670 --> 01:07:56,269
<b>(It's a touch-and-go situation.)</b>

1986
01:07:56,269 --> 01:07:57,952
<b>Jong Kook, please.</b>

1987
01:07:58,239 --> 01:08:00,739
<b>(Despite his effort,)</b>

1988
01:08:00,739 --> 01:08:03,739
<b>(the kid who grew up watching Running Man is outmatched.)</b>

1989
01:08:03,739 --> 01:08:05,432
<b>You are too strong!</b>

1990
01:08:05,780 --> 01:08:07,233
<b>(Jong Kook is relaxed.)</b>

1991
01:08:08,519 --> 01:08:09,963
<b>(Ripping)</b>

1992
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:14,503
<b>(I didn't think Name Tag Elimination would end so quickly.)</b>

1993
01:08:15,019 --> 01:08:17,289
<b>I wasn't going to rip off anyone's name tag.</b>

1994
01:08:17,289 --> 01:08:19,142
<b>I was looking for the hidden ones. Why did you follow me?</b>

1995
01:08:20,389 --> 01:08:22,530
<b>(After the storm,)</b>

1996
01:08:22,530 --> 01:08:23,659
<b>Look at this.</b>

1997
01:08:23,659 --> 01:08:24,800
<b>It broke.</b>

1998
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:26,630
<b>(only the traces of a ruthless fight remain.)</b>

1999
01:08:26,630 --> 01:08:28,383
<b>Do Hyun, you got your name tag ripped off.</b>

2000
01:08:29,539 --> 01:08:33,253
<b>You always participate in a race with someone like him.</b>

2001
01:08:33,270 --> 01:08:34,822
<b>- Yes. - How do you do it?</b>

2002
01:08:35,010 --> 01:08:37,622
<b>- They could be at the cafeteria. - There must be many here.</b>

2003
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:38,833
<b>Shall we go inside?</b>

2004
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:42,020
<b>- They could be here. - You are looking in there.</b>

2005
01:08:42,020 --> 01:08:44,579
<b>(They flaunt their skills as the fruitless search continues.)</b>

2006
01:08:44,579 --> 01:08:45,772
<b>Of course.</b>

2007
01:08:46,119 --> 01:08:47,349
<b>You are incredible.</b>

2008
01:08:47,350 --> 01:08:49,202
<b>I didn't think to look in there.</b>

2009
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:51,760
<b>They could be here.</b>

2010
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:53,213
<b>You didn't see this, did you?</b>

2011
01:08:53,829 --> 01:08:56,683
<b>(There is an envelope containing a name tag.)</b>

2012
01:08:58,260 --> 01:08:59,482
<b>This is a new pattern, right?</b>

2013
01:08:59,770 --> 01:09:01,553
<b>- Whose... - Whose name tag is inside?</b>

2014
01:09:02,170 --> 01:09:03,753
<b>Gosh, it's So Min's.</b>

2015
01:09:04,869 --> 01:09:06,522
<b>It's So Min's.</b>

2016
01:09:06,569 --> 01:09:07,640
<b>- Jae Seok. - Yes?</b>

2017
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:09,562
<b>- Give me So Min's name tag. - Why?</b>

2018
01:09:10,810 --> 01:09:12,409
<b>- Why? - I want to sell it.</b>

2019
01:09:12,409 --> 01:09:14,192
<b>(I want to sell it to the other team.)</b>

2020
01:09:16,149 --> 01:09:17,149
<b>Come on.</b>

2021
01:09:17,149 --> 01:09:18,933
<b>I am dying here.</b>

2022
01:09:19,350 --> 01:09:21,090
<b>- You can't do that. - Why not?</b>

2023
01:09:21,090 --> 01:09:23,173
<b>You can't sell your fellow team member's name tag!</b>

2024
01:09:23,890 --> 01:09:24,989
<b>- Seriously. - Give it to me.</b>

2025
01:09:24,989 --> 01:09:26,689
<b>I want to sell it for two coins.</b>

2026
01:09:26,689 --> 01:09:27,929
<b>I don't have any coins.</b>

2027
01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:29,083
<b>Give it to me.</b>

2028
01:09:30,930 --> 01:09:32,199
<b>What are you doing? What is it?</b>

2029
01:09:32,199 --> 01:09:33,383
<b>(So Min appears.)</b>

2030
01:09:33,569 --> 01:09:35,100
<b>(Both of them are flustered.)</b>

2031
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:36,599
<b>- What is it? - It's nothing.</b>

2032
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:37,970
<b>- What were you doing? - What?</b>

2033
01:09:37,970 --> 01:09:40,093
<b>What were you doing? What is that?</b>

2034
01:09:40,439 --> 01:09:42,662
<b>- What is that? - Whose name tag is it?</b>

2035
01:09:42,710 --> 01:09:43,810
<b>- Whose is it? - Whose is it?</b>

2036
01:09:43,810 --> 01:09:46,750
<b>- I can't tell you. - Why not? We are on the same team.</b>

2037
01:09:46,750 --> 01:09:48,079
<b>- It's yours, right? - No.</b>

2038
01:09:48,079 --> 01:09:49,550
<b>- Whose is it? - Actually,</b>

2039
01:09:49,550 --> 01:09:51,680
<b>it doesn't matter whether it belongs to someone on my team or me.</b>

2040
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:53,789
<b>- I used to think the same. - Hurry up and spill.</b>

2041
01:09:53,789 --> 01:09:55,319
<b>But even a team member's name tag does matter.</b>

2042
01:09:55,319 --> 01:09:57,442
<b>(I figured it out.)</b>

2043
01:09:57,890 --> 01:09:59,159
<b>(Haha gave a new meaning to a fellow team member's name tag.)</b>

2044
01:09:59,159 --> 01:10:00,872
<b>I used to think the same until a moment ago.</b>

2045
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:02,600
<b>- But... - What do you mean?</b>

2046
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:04,029
<b>even a fellow team member's name tag has its use.</b>

2047
01:10:04,029 --> 01:10:05,630
<b>- Please explain. - It didn't occur to me at first.</b>

2048
01:10:05,630 --> 01:10:06,970
<b>What do you mean? What use does it have?</b>

2049
01:10:06,970 --> 01:10:08,170
<b>Whose is it? Give it to me.</b>

2050
01:10:08,170 --> 01:10:10,322
<b>- I have everyone's. - Whose is it?</b>

2051
01:10:10,770 --> 01:10:13,409
<b>(Whose name tag does she have?)</b>

2052
01:10:13,409 --> 01:10:14,622
<b>- Tell us. - In that case,</b>

2053
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:16,039
<b>- give me mine. - Why?</b>

2054
01:10:16,039 --> 01:10:17,223
<b>I will give you yours.</b>

2055
01:10:19,180 --> 01:10:21,433
<b>- Is it Jae Seok's? - Yes. I have his.</b>

2056
01:10:21,750 --> 01:10:22,963
<b>Give it to me.</b>

2057
01:10:23,479 --> 01:10:25,603
<b>- Come on. Give it to me. - Give it to me.</b>

2058
01:10:25,789 --> 01:10:28,433
<b>- I can't trust you. - You are holding it too tightly.</b>

2059
01:10:28,460 --> 01:10:29,560
<b>Come here.</b>

2060
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:30,590
<b>I will pay a coin for it.</b>

2061
01:10:30,590 --> 01:10:32,543
<b>(He wants to buy Jae Seok's name tag.)</b>

2062
01:10:33,329 --> 01:10:34,859
<b>I will sell it to you for two coins.</b>

2063
01:10:34,859 --> 01:10:36,482
<b>You are a swindler.</b>

2064
01:10:36,699 --> 01:10:37,760
<b>- Hey! - Let me see it.</b>

2065
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:38,853
<b>(Jae Seok forces the trade.)</b>

2066
01:10:39,130 --> 01:10:41,600
<b>(He opens So Min's envelope.)</b>

2067
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:42,939
<b>There is nothing inside!</b>

2068
01:10:42,939 --> 01:10:44,883
<b>(Annoyed)</b>

2069
01:10:46,069 --> 01:10:49,062
<b>(So Min is the queen of investment.)</b>

2070
01:10:49,109 --> 01:10:50,779
<b>She is the absolute worst.</b>

2071
01:10:50,779 --> 01:10:52,210
<b>I hate her.</b>

2072
01:10:52,210 --> 01:10:54,010
<b>What is wrong with her?</b>

2073
01:10:54,010 --> 01:10:55,079
<b>(Jae Seok, thank you for the trade.)</b>

2074
01:10:55,079 --> 01:10:56,833
<b>She keeps getting worse.</b>

2075
01:10:57,380 --> 01:10:59,803
<b>(After the trade...)</b>

2076
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:01,019
<b>Se Chan.</b>

2077
01:11:01,020 --> 01:11:03,189
<b>I will sell 2 of my team's name tags for 3 coins.</b>

2078
01:11:03,189 --> 01:11:04,760
<b>- My coins? Can we do that? - Yes.</b>

2079
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:06,060
<b>I don't need these name tags.</b>

2080
01:11:06,060 --> 01:11:08,060
<b>- Hold on. Stay right there. - Come here.</b>

2081
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:10,612
<b>- Stay there. - I have four name tags in total.</b>

2082
01:11:10,699 --> 01:11:13,029
<b>- Hold on. How... - I found them.</b>

2083
01:11:13,029 --> 01:11:14,600
<b>- Did you find them? - How did you find so many?</b>

2084
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:17,000
<b>I can't do anything with them since they belong to my team,</b>

2085
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,069
<b>so I want to sell them.</b>

2086
01:11:18,069 --> 01:11:21,963
<b>I need coins because Seok Jin probably won't give me any.</b>

2087
01:11:21,979 --> 01:11:23,923
<b>Thus, I want some coins for myself.</b>

2088
01:11:24,340 --> 01:11:26,433
<b>- So this is a private business. - I am running a private business.</b>

2089
01:11:27,149 --> 01:11:28,979
<b>3 coins for 2 name tags.</b>

2090
01:11:28,979 --> 01:11:30,050
<b>Five coins for these.</b>

2091
01:11:30,050 --> 01:11:32,872
<b>- I have seven name tags. - In that case...</b>

2092
01:11:32,949 --> 01:11:34,050
<b>I will pay three coins.</b>

2093
01:11:34,050 --> 01:11:35,119
<b>I will sell these for five coins.</b>

2094
01:11:35,119 --> 01:11:36,543
<b>- How many do you want to sell? - Three name tags.</b>

2095
01:11:36,590 --> 01:11:37,659
<b>You said earlier that you would sell four name tags.</b>

2096
01:11:37,659 --> 01:11:38,843
<b>There are some I can't sell.</b>

2097
01:11:38,859 --> 01:11:39,890
<b>Listen.</b>

2098
01:11:39,890 --> 01:11:41,560
<b>We can't buy from a private seller who changes her words.</b>

2099
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:43,500
<b>- Let's go. - I have three name tags to sell.</b>

2100
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:45,430
<b>- Let's go. - Buy two name tags.</b>

2101
01:11:45,430 --> 01:11:47,199
<b>ZICO, buy two name tags.</b>

2102
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:48,640
<b>- Buy two name tags. - ZICO.</b>

2103
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:49,952
<b>This is how you do business.</b>

2104
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:53,322
<b>(This is how you do business.)</b>

2105
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:55,862
<b>They are so cheap.</b>

2106
01:11:55,939 --> 01:11:57,439
<b>(She is tired from meeting annoying customers.)</b>

2107
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:58,633
<b>I would buy all of these name tags.</b>

2108
01:11:59,079 --> 01:12:00,380
<b>I don't even know. I will get going.</b>

2109
01:12:00,380 --> 01:12:02,380
<b>(It's another peace race on Running Man.)</b>

2110
01:12:02,380 --> 01:12:04,020
<b>I should have gotten more coins.</b>

2111
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:05,673
<b>- I will give you the next question. - Okay.</b>

2112
01:12:06,189 --> 01:12:08,350
<b>This one is about So Min.</b>

2113
01:12:08,350 --> 01:12:09,760
<b>I don't know anything about So Min.</b>

2114
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:11,890
<b>On Running Man, So Min once said,</b>

2115
01:12:11,890 --> 01:12:16,799
<b>"In high school, 'Blank' went into my clothes by accident."</b>

2116
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:18,500
<b>- Blank? - What goes in the blank?</b>

2117
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:20,069
<b>- It went into her clothes? - Yes.</b>

<b>Is it incorrect?</b>

2120
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:25,909
<b>(Kwang Soo hits his head with the stick part.)</b>

2121
01:12:25,909 --> 01:12:27,152
<b>Gosh, I am sorry.</b>

2122
01:12:27,670 --> 01:12:29,238
<b>Gosh, I am sorry.</b>

2123
01:12:29,239 --> 01:12:31,510
<b>- It was an accident. - What did you use to hit me?</b>

2124
01:12:31,510 --> 01:12:33,833
<b>- It was an accident. - What did you use to hit me?</b>

2125
01:12:34,109 --> 01:12:35,633
<b>It was an accident.</b>

2126

<b>Are you okay?</b>

2127
01:12:37,449 --> 01:12:38,550
<b>It was an accident.</b>

2128
01:12:38,550 --> 01:12:40,349
<b>- You were closer than I thought. - All right.</b>

2129
01:12:40,350 --> 01:12:41,633
<b>I shouldn't have stretched my arm.</b>

2130
01:12:41,789 --> 01:12:44,343
<b>- I shouldn't have stretched my arm. - All right.</b>

2131
01:12:45,229 --> 01:12:46,612
<b>Let me answer. A petal.</b>

2132

<b>(Seok Jin's answer is incorrect.)</b>

2133

<b>(Aim well.)</b>

2134
01:12:50,659 --> 01:12:51,843
<b>It's here.</b>

2135
01:12:53,300 --> 01:12:56,353
<b>(What? Kwang Soo hits his head with the side this time.)</b>

<b>What are you doing?</b>

2138
01:13:00,670 --> 01:13:02,162
<b>I hit you properly this time.</b>

2139

<b>- It felt different, you jerk. - Why?</b>

2140
01:13:04,180 --> 01:13:06,692
<b>(It's a strange toy hammer that hits with a thud.)</b>

2141
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:07,909
<b>What?</b>

2142
01:13:07,909 --> 01:13:09,020
<b>I hit you properly this time.</b>

<b>(This is strange.)</b>

2149

<b>ZICO, did you put coins in the piggy banks?</b>

<b>Seong Wu, did you put coins in the piggy banks?</b>

<b>You have the right to go in there.</b>

<b>Why didn't you give a single coin to the members?</b>

<b>Hard work pays off, okay?</b>

2177
01:14:07,239 --> 01:14:09,710
<b>It's not like I will take all the coins.</b>

2178
01:14:09,710 --> 01:14:11,109
<b>Shouldn't we get the coins...</b>

2179

<b>- Give us two coins each. - Let me ask you this.</b>

2184

<b>Who is your captain?</b>

2185
01:14:21,850 --> 01:14:23,060
<b>Then why are you listening to him?</b>

2186

<b>We will put some coins in your piggy bank too.</b>

2187

<b>Be fair. We will put some coins in your piggy bank too.</b>

2188

<b>Go and work!</b>

2192

<b>Do you think I am lazing around? Go and work!</b>

2194
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:41,640
<b>- Don't let him sway you. - Use this time to get...</b>

2195
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:43,239
<b>as many name tags as possible.</b>

2196
01:14:43,239 --> 01:14:45,893
<b>If I were you, I would give away my name tag to sabotage him.</b>

2197

<b>- Hey. - I didn't think about this.</b>

2198

<b>Why are you ganging up on me?</b>

2199

<b>(The group action makes Kwang Soo anxious.)</b>

2200

<b>- I will distribute them as I want. - Okay.</b>

2201
01:14:52,789 --> 01:14:54,032
<b>I will distribute them as I want.</b>

2202

<b>Close your eyes.</b>

2203
01:14:57,119 --> 01:14:59,259
<b>- Close your eyes. - We worked hard!</b>

2204
01:14:59,260 --> 01:15:01,213
<b>Close your eyes.</b>

2205

<b>(They close their eyes willingly because they are nice.)</b>

2207
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:06,029
<b>I see someone who didn't close his eyes.</b>

<b>Hold on.</b>

2213
01:15:15,510 --> 01:15:17,162

<b>I worked so hard.</b>

2222

<b>There is no one I can trust, okay?</b>

2239

<b>Seong Wu, will get five coins.</b>

2243
01:16:16,239 --> 01:16:17,500
<b>This is nothing to be happy about.</b>

<b>Look at the forest, not the trees.</b>

2256

<b>(Then he adds another one.)</b>

<b>Rip off name tags like crazy. We're losing right now.</b>

2269
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:12,043
<b>- Hurry. Anybody! - Hurry up.</b>

2270
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:13,090
<b>Should I go now?</b>

2271
01:17:13,090 --> 01:17:14,090
<b>(ZICO was abandoned by Kwang Soo,)</b>

2272
01:17:14,090 --> 01:17:15,390
<b>(but he shows his loyalty near the end.)</b>

2273
01:17:15,390 --> 01:17:17,229
<b>- They're not my team. - Okay!</b>

2274
01:17:17,229 --> 01:17:18,600
<b>- Four dollars. - Hurry!</b>

2275
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:21,353
<b>(He flung ZICO earlier, but he loves him now.)</b>

2276
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:24,282
<b>We're behind by 12 to 13.</b>

2277
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:27,192
<b>- Your team has enough. Take it. - Wait.</b>

2278
01:17:27,439 --> 01:17:29,810
<b>Your team has enough. Give it to yourself.</b>

2279
01:17:29,810 --> 01:17:31,140
<b>Race is over.</b>

2280
01:17:31,140 --> 01:17:33,380
<b>This is the last chance.</b>

2281
01:17:33,380 --> 01:17:34,793
<b>(Race is over, and this is the last chance to deposit coins.)</b>

2282
01:17:35,279 --> 01:17:36,819
<b>(Did Kwang Soo and the team see the forest or the trees?)</b>

2283
01:17:36,819 --> 01:17:39,189
<b>- I think we won. - You guys already won.</b>

2284
01:17:39,189 --> 01:17:40,633
<b>Race is over.</b>

2285
01:17:41,020 --> 01:17:43,460
<b>We're counting the coins right now.</b>

2286
01:17:43,460 --> 01:17:45,489
<b>As I said before, we'll compare which captain has more coins,</b>

2287
01:17:45,489 --> 01:17:47,130
<b>and the team with that captain wins.</b>

2288
01:17:47,130 --> 01:17:48,590
<b>1st and 2nd place on the winning team will win prizes,</b>

2289

<b>and the last two on the losing team will face the penalty.</b>

2290
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:52,869
<b>I heard something shocking from that team,</b>

2291
01:17:52,869 --> 01:17:53,899
<b>but I hope it's not true.</b>

2292
01:17:53,899 --> 01:17:56,053
<b>Somebody sold their name tag.</b>

2293
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:58,239
<b>- No way. - Somebody gave 2 to 3 coins...</b>

2294
01:17:58,239 --> 01:17:59,909
<b>per name tag.</b>

2295
01:17:59,909 --> 01:18:01,969
<b>- I hope it's not true. - This is the funny part.</b>

2296
01:18:01,970 --> 01:18:03,109
<b>They sold other people's name tags for cheap...</b>

2297
01:18:03,109 --> 01:18:05,022
<b>and sold their own at a higher price.</b>

2298
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:07,180
<b>Other people for cheap, and theirs at a higher price.</b>

2299
01:18:07,180 --> 01:18:10,433
<b>I heard my name tag got sold for a coin.</b>

2300
01:18:10,479 --> 01:18:13,119
<b>My team fell apart.</b>

2301
01:18:13,119 --> 01:18:15,433
<b>There was no other way. I didn't want to lose.</b>

2302
01:18:16,390 --> 01:18:18,560
<b>- Seok Jin, look at yours first. - Okay, I will.</b>

2303
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:19,689
<b>This.</b>

2304
01:18:19,689 --> 01:18:20,859
<b>It looks heavy.</b>

2305
01:18:20,859 --> 01:18:23,899
<b>- You probably have a lot. - I know, I gave him a lot.</b>

<b>I gave him everything.</b>

2307

<b>- Stop lying. - I gave him a lot.</b>

2308
01:18:27,170 --> 01:18:28,270
<b>That's a lot.</b>

2309
01:18:28,270 --> 01:18:30,100
<b>Haha is lying 100 percent.</b>

2310
01:18:30,100 --> 01:18:31,869
<b>Seok Jin got...</b>

<b>43 coins.</b>

<b>43 in this?</b>

2314

<b>That's a lot.</b>

2315

<b>- I gave you all of them. - I gave you them all.</b>

2316

<b>Really? You gave me a lot.</b>

2317
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:41,162
<b>(Kwang Soo opens his piggy bank.)</b>

2318
01:18:42,279 --> 01:18:43,562
<b>We should have more.</b>

2319

<b>Maybe we won.</b>

2322
01:18:48,550 --> 01:18:50,159
<b>- We won. - I think we won.</b>

2323

<b>- See? - We won.</b>

2327

<b>- We're family. - Wait.</b>

2328

<b>That was everything.</b>

2329

<b>- Let me tell you. - These people.</b>

2333

<b>Kwang Soo's piggy bank...</b>

2334

01:19:09,710 --> 01:19:12,210
<b>(Only 16?)</b>

<b>- What? - Overall,</b>

2337

<b>Seok Jin had 70,</b>

2338

<b>(Kwang Soo was ahead by 13.)</b>

2339

<b>and Kwang Soo had 56.</b>

<b>(With only 56, Team Kwang Soo loses.)</b>

<b>This is amazing.</b>

2345
01:19:31,859 --> 01:19:34,199
<b>You guys! I told you.</b>

2346

<b>Really?</b>

2347
01:19:35,470 --> 01:19:36,470
<b>No, look.</b>

2348
01:19:36,470 --> 01:19:38,170
<b>I got seven, and I gave you everything.</b>

2349

<b>I didn't get too many.</b>

2350

<b>They took the coins for themselves.</b>

2351

<b>This is so unfair.</b>

<b>Yes. I'm in first place?</b>

2358

<b>The individual businesswoman won.</b>

2359
01:19:57,960 --> 01:19:59,260
<b>She got a couple from us.</b>

2360

<b>(She collected small sums and created a miracle.)</b>

2361
01:20:00,659 --> 01:20:02,899
<b>She got none in here, and she won?</b>

2362

<b>Jong Kook!</b>

<b>Kwang Soo, open each one.</b>

<b>I don't know anymore.</b>

<b>Ji Hun first.</b>

<b>I'm not really suspicious.</b>

2372

<b>Like this? Okay.</b>

2373
01:20:24,819 --> 01:20:26,473
<b>- Is there a lot? - Is there a good amount?</b>

2374
01:20:26,819 --> 01:20:28,319
<b>It looks kind of heavy.</b>

<b>(Spilling)</b>

<b>(He's shocked.)</b>

<b>- How many? - Ji Hun deposited 14 coins.</b>

<b>He took all for himself.</b>

<b>(There's also a lot.)</b>

<b>Really?</b>

<b>That was less than I thought.</b>

2397

<b>He even caused a revolt.</b>

2398

<b>How many?</b>

2399
01:21:09,859 --> 01:21:11,260
<b>- He has a lot. - Seong Wu...</b>

<b>(ZICO seemed the most sneaky on Team Kwang Soo,)</b>

<b>Kwang Soo, you will be getting the penalty.</b>

<b>Last place is Do Hyun,</b>

<b>- How intense is it? - It's good.</b>

2425
01:21:54,539 --> 01:21:56,079
<b>No, it's not too bad.</b>

2426
01:21:56,079 --> 01:21:57,293
<b>It's just the forehead.</b>
