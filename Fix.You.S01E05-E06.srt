1
00:00:08,169 --> 00:00:09,639
I am crazy.

2
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:12,250
I am, but...

3
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:14,380
are you confident?

4
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:17,349
Can you really treat me?

5
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:24,859
You are not crazy.

6
00:00:25,219 --> 00:00:26,589
You're in pain.

7
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,960
If you just admit that
you're in pain,

8
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:34,730
you can be treated.

9
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:39,509
It looks like
you also have a sickness.

10
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:41,640
An occupational sickness.

11
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,579
Everyone you meet
must seem like patients to you.

12
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,780
But you see, I'm not in pain.

13
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,250
I just have a nasty temper.

14
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:57,090
Thank you for the offer,
but I'll take care of myself.

15
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:00,359
Goodbye.

16
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:24,450
What kind of a doctor
gathers his own patients?

17
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,280
Maybe I should've told him
that I'm already seeing a doctor.

18
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:48,409
Ms. Han refused to get treated.

19
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:50,480
I think it's going to take
some time.

20
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:03,489
(Ji Young Won)

21
00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:05,596
So what if it takes some time?

22
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,359
It's fine as long as
you don't give up.

23
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:09,805
A bad doctor isn't someone
who's incompetent.

24
00:02:09,829 --> 00:02:11,709
It's someone who gives up.
You know that, right?

25
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:13,629
What's with the blackmailing?

26
00:02:23,139 --> 00:02:25,139
(Episode 5)

27
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:33,120
Hello.

28
00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:35,120
Did you sleep well?

29
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:38,289
Go. Go away.

30
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,990
Go.

31
00:02:47,129 --> 00:02:48,506
- Go away.
- Last night,

32
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,699
he didn't sleep a wink.

33
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:52,300
Go.

34
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:56,015
Go. Go away.

35
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:58,280
Do you still eat nothing but snacks?

36
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:00,556
Just give me my medicine.

37
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,479
Don't bother asking me questions.

38
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:06,620
If you keep refusing to talk,
you won't be able to get treated.

39
00:03:28,569 --> 00:03:29,680
Hello.

40
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:31,479
Did Dr. Park call you?

41
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:32,650
You too?

42
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,479
I wonder why he needs us.

43
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,340
It's probably regarding
an emergency patient.

44
00:03:57,139 --> 00:03:59,985
Sung Min Ho. 32 years old. Male.

45
00:04:00,009 --> 00:04:03,080
A few days ago, he came to the ER
due to abdominal pain.

46
00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:05,115
The gastroscopy and X-ray showed...

47
00:04:05,139 --> 00:04:08,610
a foreign substance in his stomach,
so they took him straight to the OR.

48
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:10,795
And it turns out he had pica.

49
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:12,425
(Pica: An eating disorder where one
craves things that are not food)

50
00:04:12,449 --> 00:04:15,319
Sir, what was the foreign substance
that was found in his stomach?

51
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,590
Paper.

52
00:04:19,129 --> 00:04:21,229
(Sung Min Ho)

53
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:24,100
He swallowed an entire house.

54
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:28,329
I think I know this patient.

55
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,300
How?

56
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,449
Sung Min Ho!

57
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,906
Dad... Dad.

58
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:27,529
You pathetic punk.

59
00:05:28,589 --> 00:05:30,500
What is the matter with you?

60
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,829
When will you become a decent human?

61
00:05:33,629 --> 00:05:36,500
I'm... I'm sorry.

62
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:40,939
He looked very nervous.

63
00:05:42,579 --> 00:05:44,915
I want you to treat this patient.

64
00:05:44,939 --> 00:05:46,649
Okay, sir.

65
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,226
How is Hwang Bo Young?

66
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,726
I've prescribed her
some drugs for now.

67
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,565
The antihistamine cyproheptadine...

68
00:05:53,589 --> 00:05:55,365
is said to suppress serotonin...

69
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:57,565
to control satiety and
increase one's appetite,

70
00:05:57,589 --> 00:05:58,920
so I'm looking into that.

71
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:01,430
I'm also carrying out psychotherapy,

72
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,829
but I haven't been able to
get a conversation going.

73
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,129
Keep an eye on the patient anyway.

74
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:09,600
I will.

75
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,675
Keep up the good work.

76
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:12,709
Yes, sir.

77
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:14,769
- Bye.
- Bye.

78
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,755
- I'm off too.
- Okay.

79
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:19,509
- Good job.
- You too.

80
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:24,949
He really ate a lot.

81
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:26,550
Where is he now?

82
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,560
I was getting ready to leave...

83
00:06:34,329 --> 00:06:37,230
when I was told to go to Psychiatry.

84
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:39,129
I was surprised.

85
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:42,005
Why? Do you feel uncomfortable?

86
00:06:42,029 --> 00:06:43,740
Rather than feel uncomfortable,

87
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,509
it's more like I don't get why.

88
00:06:48,339 --> 00:06:49,480
Did you eat paper?

89
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:51,615
That's called pica...

90
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:53,279
and it's an eating disorder.

91
00:06:53,709 --> 00:06:57,180
It's caused by feelings of
depression or anxiety.

92
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,790
I'd like to have a chat.

93
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:03,720
Do you eat paper often?

94
00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:05,696
It was the first time.

95
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,466
How did it taste?
I've never tried it.

96
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:10,730
Every kind is different.
They have different textures.

97
00:07:11,529 --> 00:07:13,300
There's a slightly sweet taste.

98
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:16,300
You know well considering
it was your first try.

99
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:18,670
Do you have a super palate?

100
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:25,480
- Why did you eat it?
- Because...

101
00:07:28,209 --> 00:07:29,519
I guess...

102
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,290
I was curious as to how it tasted.

103
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,620
Something happened right before?

104
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:40,490
Can you tell me what?

105
00:07:51,339 --> 00:07:54,870
I work at a paper craft company.

106
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:57,680
We make miniature buildings
out of paper...

107
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:01,310
and supply them to
paper museums or model houses.

108
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,259
I think that's when I felt hungry.

109
00:08:13,829 --> 00:08:15,829
It was meant to be
handed in that day.

110
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:19,470
- Who did this?
- What happened?

111
00:08:19,569 --> 00:08:21,175
- My gosh.
- Who did this?

112
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,199
- What happened to it?
- We worked so hard on it.

113
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,540
- I know.
- It's a mess.

114
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,480
Was it you? Did you do it?

115
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:33,949
You psycho. Are you crazy?

116
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:38,395
- What?
- What's wrong?

117
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:40,220
- I couldn't breathe and...
- Min Ho!

118
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,919
I fainted.

119
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:51,399
What is your father like?

120
00:08:51,929 --> 00:08:53,029
My dad?

121
00:08:54,769 --> 00:08:56,870
I respect him more than
anyone in the world.

122
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,970
He started from nothing
and succeeded.

123
00:08:59,769 --> 00:09:02,740
Someone like me
can never even reach his feet.

124
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:07,409
When will I become a decent human?

125
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,220
I feel guilty
towards my dad all the time.

126
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:17,559
I saw in the photo that
you'd swallowed the house whole.

127
00:09:17,659 --> 00:09:18,789
Why is that?

128
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,129
What if it got stuck in your throat?

129
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:25,559
I didn't want to chew the house.

130
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,200
Then it would become damaged.

131
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:40,309
But one morning the fog was dense

132
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:45,580
And we were dragged away

133
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:49,149
By men with swords

134
00:09:49,419 --> 00:09:56,159
We didn't know why
or where we were going

135
00:09:56,529 --> 00:10:01,769
No one told us anything

136
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:04,970
Just like our country

137
00:10:06,169 --> 00:10:08,440
Your singing's good and you can act,

138
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,509
but your scandal bothers me.

139
00:10:11,539 --> 00:10:13,350
Try again once it has died down.

140
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:15,309
What a load of nonsense!

141
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:26,230
Hey, I heard
you're putting on a show.

142
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:29,559
Do you need an actress?

143
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,899
I won the Best Female Newcomer.

144
00:10:40,909 --> 00:10:42,349
What do you mean
why did I accept it?

145
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:46,549
Why should I refuse the award?
What did I do wrong?

146
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,120
How dare you say that to me?

147
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,830
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

148
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:11,740
- Can we order?
- Just a moment, please.

149
00:11:12,299 --> 00:11:13,740
Can we have some water?

150
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:16,686
You have to get it yourself. Sorry.

151
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:19,340
- Is our food not ready yet?
- It's coming.

152
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,450
I'm coming.

153
00:11:25,149 --> 00:11:26,450
I'll take your order.

154
00:11:26,889 --> 00:11:28,720
- Two spicy stir-fried pork.
- Two spicy pork.

155
00:11:35,659 --> 00:11:37,159
Do you want some water?

156
00:11:37,259 --> 00:11:38,936
- Which table?
- Number two.

157
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,970
Okay.

158
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:42,105
- Can we order extra?
- Here you go.

159
00:11:42,129 --> 00:11:43,299
Give me a moment.

160
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:51,379
Something happened today.

161
00:12:11,029 --> 00:12:12,100
Sung Min Ho!

162
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:30,679
I didn't want to chew the house.

163
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:34,049
Then it would become damaged.

164
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,176
Hey.

165
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,129
Sung Min Ho was
treated for anxiety three years ago.

166
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:49,346
Caused by what?

167
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,299
Fear of his father.

168
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:54,710
If it was three years ago,
wouldn't he be cured by now?

169
00:12:55,009 --> 00:12:56,779
We should say it got worse.

170
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,416
Pica occurs mostly in...

171
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,450
children aged 1 to 4, not adults.

172
00:13:02,809 --> 00:13:05,495
Whenever Sung Min Ho
becomes anxious,

173
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:06,625
he stutters...

174
00:13:06,649 --> 00:13:08,289
and chews on his fingernails.

175
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,690
They're all symptoms
commonly found in children.

176
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:15,429
I say the pica is
connected to his anxiety.

177
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:19,000
What's more is that the reason
he swallowed the house whole...

178
00:13:20,429 --> 00:13:21,970
was due to attachment.

179
00:13:22,299 --> 00:13:24,600
We should assume
he was traumatized as a child.

180
00:13:25,669 --> 00:13:29,015
In this case, the person
who actually needs treatment...

181
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:31,816
is the person who caused
the trauma, not the victim.

182
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,710
Dr. Lee. What do you mean by that?

183
00:13:35,379 --> 00:13:37,296
To treat Sung Min Ho,

184
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,450
we must treat his father first.

185
00:13:40,649 --> 00:13:43,220
How can we treat a man
who never comes in?

186
00:13:44,789 --> 00:13:46,929
Figuring out a way to do that...

187
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:50,100
is your job, isn't it?

188
00:13:53,669 --> 00:13:55,269
Hi, Ji Sun, it's me.

189
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:58,046
- Hello.
- Welcome.

190
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,985
It's been a while, Dr. Lee.

191
00:14:00,009 --> 00:14:01,169
It has, hasn't it?

192
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:06,039
- Woo Joo, you're here too?
- Yes.

193
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,625
Is she the musical actress
from last...

194
00:14:11,649 --> 00:14:12,820
Yes, that's me.

195
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,519
I lost my job because of that
and now I work here.

196
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:16,820
I apologize.

197
00:14:17,259 --> 00:14:18,765
Will you join us
if you haven't eaten yet?

198
00:14:18,789 --> 00:14:20,730
Part-timers
don't eat with customers.

199
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,529
What will you have?

200
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,570
Come by again.

201
00:14:36,169 --> 00:14:38,086
I'm sorry, but we're closed.

202
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,726
We won't stay for long.

203
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,509
We're out of ingredients.

204
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,649
- I apologize.
- We'll eat real quick.

205
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,789
When you come next time,
I'll give you a lot of extra food.

206
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:50,889
- It's her, right?
- Who?

207
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:52,789
Aren't you the musical actress?

208
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:55,129
Yes. I'm Han Woo Joo.

209
00:14:56,899 --> 00:14:58,299
You're just fine.

210
00:14:58,429 --> 00:15:00,275
After being humiliated like that,

211
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:02,230
I don't think I'd ever
appear in public.

212
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:07,409
But then, people
should be thick-skinned.

213
00:15:08,269 --> 00:15:09,669
- Let's go.
- Okay.

214
00:15:10,179 --> 00:15:11,210
Bye.

215
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,326
I didn't drink and drive.

216
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,610
As if you didn't.

217
00:15:14,809 --> 00:15:16,495
I saw you get handcuffed on live TV.

218
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:18,279
He wasn't a real policeman.

219
00:15:19,649 --> 00:15:21,019
I didn't do it!

220
00:15:22,289 --> 00:15:23,990
Are you out of your mind?

221
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:27,259
- Why did you scream?
- That's enough.

222
00:15:27,789 --> 00:15:28,889
I didn't do it.

223
00:15:29,899 --> 00:15:31,706
Get your facts straight
before you talk.

224
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,129
Have you lost your mind?

225
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:35,230
Will you hit me?
Do you want to hit me?

226
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:37,275
Hit me so I can
make some money off you!

227
00:15:37,299 --> 00:15:38,570
- Let go!
- Don't!

228
00:15:39,169 --> 00:15:40,210
Hit me!

229
00:15:48,509 --> 00:15:50,049
- Jong Hoon!
- Step aside.

230
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,750
Sir. Hey. Shouldn't we call 911?

231
00:16:19,309 --> 00:16:21,549
Everything will be fine.
Don't worry.

232
00:16:22,309 --> 00:16:23,750
Go home safely.

233
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,456
- Goodbye.
- Thank you for the food.

234
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,480
Bye.

235
00:16:44,139 --> 00:16:46,639
What if that customer
got a concussion?

236
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:49,269
I just got really angry.

237
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,580
Sorry.

238
00:16:59,049 --> 00:17:00,820
Do you think we don't know
how to get angry?

239
00:17:01,149 --> 00:17:03,469
You really need to do something
about that temper of yours.

240
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,901
You already got in so much trouble
because of your temper.

241
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,059
You already lost so many people.

242
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:10,559
I tried really hard
to hold it in today.

243
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,400
It burst because I couldn't
hold it in anymore.

244
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:21,190
You don't get counseling
these days, do you?

245
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:25,009
Do you also think I'm a patient?

246
00:17:27,779 --> 00:17:29,880
What is the matter with everyone?

247
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:35,519
Hey.

248
00:17:37,259 --> 00:17:40,206
Hey, I should be the one mad at you!

249
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:41,859
What did I do wrong?

250
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:44,136
Everything was fine
up until you brought it up.

251
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,299
Why would you ask
about her counseling?

252
00:17:51,569 --> 00:17:53,410
I'm just worried about her.

253
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:12,619
A lot of things must've
made you angry today.

254
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,005
How did you know?

255
00:18:15,029 --> 00:18:16,559
By the strength in your arms.

256
00:18:16,859 --> 00:18:18,000
Bam.

257
00:18:20,769 --> 00:18:22,299
Did you fail your audition?

258
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:23,845
Are you a shaman?

259
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:25,075
Ever since I was young,

260
00:18:25,099 --> 00:18:27,069
people told me
I have a real good hunch.

261
00:18:28,569 --> 00:18:30,585
Are all psychiatrists like you?

262
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:33,309
No, not at all. I'm very unique.

263
00:18:35,609 --> 00:18:38,049
Gosh, what a bunch of fools.

264
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:41,220
Your singing touches so many people.

265
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:43,690
But they don't even know that.

266
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,637
Right?

267
00:18:45,661 --> 00:18:47,730
Have you ever heard me sing?

268
00:18:48,529 --> 00:18:49,529
No.

269
00:18:50,859 --> 00:18:52,660
You really are unique.

270
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,390
- What is this?
- A gift.

271
00:19:24,099 --> 00:19:25,200
Open it at home.

272
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,769
The hospital is always open.
You know that, right?

273
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:33,640
You can come whenever you want.
Oh, goodness.

274
00:19:34,309 --> 00:19:37,640
I'm sorry. I really have
an occupational sickness.

275
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,186
Forget what I just said.

276
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:41,349
You really are persistent.

277
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,765
(Prescription)

278
00:20:21,789 --> 00:20:25,420
Prescription. Exercise at night.

279
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:26,720
What is this?

280
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,039
What am I doing?

281
00:21:14,869 --> 00:21:15,869
(Nursing Home)

282
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:19,839
Hello?

283
00:21:22,849 --> 00:21:24,519
Okay, I'll be right there.

284
00:21:57,319 --> 00:22:00,049
Dad! Dad!

285
00:22:03,619 --> 00:22:05,460
Dad! Dad!

286
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:09,359
Si Joon?

287
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:16,829
Yes, it's me.

288
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:23,839
Gosh, look at yourself.

289
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,309
Aren't you cold?

290
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,380
I'm cold. It's freezing.

291
00:22:31,849 --> 00:22:32,849
It's cold.

292
00:22:55,769 --> 00:22:57,240
Sir!

293
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,980
Sir!

294
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,279
Sir, where are you?

295
00:23:03,309 --> 00:23:05,349
- Sir!
- Sir!

296
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:07,789
Sir!

297
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:15,089
He still does rounds twice a day.

298
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:18,206
Our patients ask for your father
instead of me.

299
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,470
They think of him
as a very skilled doctor.

300
00:23:24,039 --> 00:23:25,299
A while ago,

301
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,616
he recognized me.

302
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,339
He gets his memory back
very frequently these days.

303
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:33,650
And he tries to escape
every time that happens.

304
00:23:34,609 --> 00:23:38,626
How is the patient that my dad
almost tried to do surgery on?

305
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,150
He's at the nearby hospital.

306
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,126
Thank goodness
he only needed stitches.

307
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:44,160
Things could've
really gotten out of hand.

308
00:23:45,019 --> 00:23:48,535
We can't keep our eyes on him
every minute of the day.

309
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:51,200
But it's not like we can
tie him up either.

310
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,329
I'm so sorry.

311
00:24:12,049 --> 00:24:13,180
Who are you?

312
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:17,190
Are you the new resident?

313
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,735
What are you doing here?

314
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:21,759
Hurry up and get ready for rounds.

315
00:24:23,059 --> 00:24:24,799
What are you doing, you fool?

316
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:29,299
You don't need...

317
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,075
to do rounds today, sir.

318
00:24:32,099 --> 00:24:33,076
What?

319
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:35,410
I already checked on
all the patients.

320
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,555
Everyone is fine.

321
00:24:37,579 --> 00:24:39,539
How arrogant of you.
Who do you think you are?

322
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:42,809
We haven't had
a smart doctor like you in a while.

323
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:49,450
It'd be great if my son
was also smart like you.

324
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,029
He's a doctor, too.

325
00:24:55,259 --> 00:24:57,936
I guess he became a doctor
because of you.

326
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,345
He'll never be as great as me.

327
00:25:00,369 --> 00:25:01,369
Do you know why?

328
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,569
Because he's just a psychiatrist.

329
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:08,269
Meanwhile, I'm a magician.

330
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:14,549
My son never satisfied me.

331
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,750
I should've stopped him
when I had the chance.

332
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:21,959
Would you like to be my son instead?

333
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,289
Don't you want to?

334
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,460
I can even give you all my wealth.

335
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:32,035
I guess you have a lot of money.

336
00:25:32,059 --> 00:25:33,630
No, I don't have any money.

337
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:36,200
Money isn't my wealth.

338
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,500
These hands are my wealth.

339
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,210
Those hands really were something.

340
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:49,650
Everyone agreed to that.

341
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,750
I always envied you as well.

342
00:25:56,619 --> 00:25:57,690
Dad.

343
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:49,639
We cut a part of his brother's liver
and transplanted it into his body.

344
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:52,640
That's how we managed
to overcome the rejection.

345
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:57,579
Currently, it's been four weeks
since he got the transplant.

346
00:26:58,349 --> 00:27:01,126
And he's still very healthy.
That is all.

347
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:05,559
(The First Success Case of a New
Organ Transplantation Method)

348
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:10,900
Dad!

349
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,900
Gosh, it's cold. It's freezing.

350
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:20,960
(Episode 6)

351
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,660
Are you taking your medication?

352
00:28:23,429 --> 00:28:24,730
I did, then I threw up.

353
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:27,505
Why do you torture yourself?

354
00:28:27,529 --> 00:28:29,529
Because I'm what Mom
treasures the most.

355
00:28:29,769 --> 00:28:32,800
Ruining what one values the most
hurts that person.

356
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:40,986
Ms. Hwang. If you keep this up,

357
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:45,195
the extreme malnutrition and
hormonal disorder will ruin you,

358
00:28:45,219 --> 00:28:47,250
and possibly even your brain.

359
00:28:47,949 --> 00:28:50,190
If torturing your mother
is your purpose,

360
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:52,719
how about we find another way?

361
00:28:57,429 --> 00:28:59,159
Is there a security camera in here?

362
00:29:00,729 --> 00:29:03,329
No. You can speak freely.

363
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:13,909
You know...

364
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,555
Did you just assault me?

365
00:29:17,579 --> 00:29:18,996
I can post it on social media.

366
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,820
- Ms. Hwang!
- Tell my mom.

367
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,719
That I don't need to see a doctor.

368
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:26,420
I really don't want to
come here. I hate it!

369
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:32,599
Sexual assault?

370
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:36,230
She did as her mom said
for 25 years.

371
00:29:36,269 --> 00:29:38,075
She ate and wore as she was told.

372
00:29:38,099 --> 00:29:40,239
She went to the university
she was told to go to.

373
00:29:41,269 --> 00:29:43,286
Then she suddenly exploded.

374
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:46,280
And she chose to abuse herself.

375
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:50,909
I think she needs to focus on
psychotherapy first.

376
00:29:51,409 --> 00:29:54,555
Anorexia patients
secrete excess endorphins.

377
00:29:54,579 --> 00:29:58,790
Because they're happier when
they starve than when they eat.

378
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,906
I think the deficient
happy hormones...

379
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:05,406
are being paradoxically
supplemented by the starving.

380
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:06,775
That's an interesting hypothesis.

381
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:09,329
That hypothesis
could explain why people...

382
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:10,846
get addicted to starving.

383
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:13,275
So you'll redistribute her hormones
with medication?

384
00:30:13,299 --> 00:30:15,840
Yes. And psychotherapy will follow.

385
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,739
I look forward to it.

386
00:30:21,209 --> 00:30:25,150
Your pica patient's symptoms
were caused by the fear of his dad?

387
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:28,490
My approach could help him as well.

388
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,219
Early this morning,

389
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:35,430
I went to see my dad.

390
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:39,830
I realized only today
how small he actually is.

391
00:30:42,069 --> 00:30:43,900
On my way back,

392
00:30:44,569 --> 00:30:48,270
I wondered how my dad
ended up like that.

393
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:53,740
Everyone becomes
small and old with age.

394
00:30:56,379 --> 00:30:59,050
Why did I try to avoid him
all my life?

395
00:31:01,479 --> 00:31:04,389
I don't know what happened to
Sung Min Ho,

396
00:31:06,289 --> 00:31:08,009
but maybe this is what
he needs to find out.

397
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:23,639
- Thanks.
- Dr. Lee.

398
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,439
I just got a call that Sung Min Ho
canceled his appointment.

399
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:30,009
Who gave permission?

400
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:35,126
Would you like some?

401
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:36,919
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thanks.

402
00:31:38,419 --> 00:31:41,295
The food here looks amazing.
It's quite a spread.

403
00:31:41,319 --> 00:31:42,590
Is it always like this?

404
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:44,659
Dr. Lee.

405
00:31:46,759 --> 00:31:49,675
Wh-What are you do-doing here?

406
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:52,569
Are you flustered?
You're stuttering.

407
00:31:54,199 --> 00:31:56,286
You canceled your appointment,

408
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:58,509
so I came over
in case you were busy.

409
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:02,509
A change of scenery helps
shift things around sometimes.

410
00:32:03,879 --> 00:32:05,819
Let's eat. I'm hungry.

411
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,550
This is lovely.

412
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:10,789
I'm full and the weather's great.

413
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,930
How tall is your father?

414
00:32:17,129 --> 00:32:18,330
Why do you ask?

415
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:22,169
You don't know?
What size shoes does he wear?

416
00:32:25,129 --> 00:32:26,840
I guess you two aren't close.

417
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,015
You don't know much about him.

418
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:33,509
My dad's no-not my friend.
We ca-can't be cl-close.

419
00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:37,279
I should re-respect him.

420
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:42,319
Let's fix your stutter first.

421
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,120
This wasn't the first time
you ate paper.

422
00:32:45,319 --> 00:32:46,889
When was the first time?

423
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:48,930
Why...

424
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:53,036
Why are you do-doing this to me?

425
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:54,930
Because I want to treat you.

426
00:32:55,899 --> 00:32:56,876
Why?

427
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:59,100
Because I'm a doctor
and you're my patient.

428
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:06,180
I know that you tried
immensely hard to fix yourself.

429
00:33:06,639 --> 00:33:08,255
I bet you saw doctors...

430
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:10,709
and looked yourself
in the mirror to stop.

431
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:13,680
You said last time that...

432
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:16,319
you didn't want to chew the house.

433
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,689
I know what that feels like.

434
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:25,029
At one time,

435
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:30,170
I feared my father
more than anyone in the world.

436
00:33:35,939 --> 00:33:37,339
Trust me.

437
00:33:38,209 --> 00:33:39,779
Ca-Can you...

438
00:33:41,509 --> 00:33:43,810
re-really...

439
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:47,850
fi-fix me?

440
00:33:53,319 --> 00:33:54,860
Are you still angry?

441
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:56,889
No.

442
00:33:57,029 --> 00:33:59,375
I was going to come and help out.

443
00:33:59,399 --> 00:34:03,529
Forget that. Do you know
the musical "Cinderella"?

444
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:05,870
The director of music is my senior.

445
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:08,646
I mentioned you to them
and they want to cast you.

446
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:09,647
Are you sure?

447
00:34:09,671 --> 00:34:11,240
It's not that big a role.

448
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:14,555
Hey! Come on.

449
00:34:14,579 --> 00:34:18,149
Why didn't you tell me that
you had such connections?

450
00:34:19,579 --> 00:34:22,865
Thank you. I won't forget
what you did for me.

451
00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:24,120
Are you that pleased?

452
00:34:24,149 --> 00:34:26,995
I didn't just grow on my own

453
00:34:27,019 --> 00:34:27,996
I didn't

454
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:31,529
Every breath I took was a sigh

455
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:35,800
Where is your love?

456
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:38,976
There is a thing as destiny

457
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:39,977
- Of course!
- Of course!

458
00:34:40,001 --> 00:34:43,846
Are you waiting for
your prince charming?

459
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:47,985
That's how the world is

460
00:34:48,009 --> 00:34:51,625
Your first love is waiting for you

461
00:34:51,649 --> 00:34:55,055
That's what I'm looking for

462
00:34:55,079 --> 00:34:56,196
Let's go!

463
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:57,665
To the right!

464
00:34:57,689 --> 00:34:59,136
To the left!

465
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,665
This way!

466
00:35:00,689 --> 00:35:02,790
Now it's time to dance!

467
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:19,339
- This is your destiny
- This is your destiny

468
00:35:21,379 --> 00:35:22,726
Okay, let's take a 10-minute break.

469
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:24,086
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

470
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:25,590
- You guys have improved.
- Thank you.

471
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:30,819
Excuse me.

472
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:34,490
Oh, Ms. Han.
Ji Sun told me about you.

473
00:35:34,819 --> 00:35:36,906
We're just a small ensemble group.
Are you okay with that?

474
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:39,660
Of course. I'm ready to do anything.

475
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,245
I'm sure you're talented
since you even won...

476
00:35:42,269 --> 00:35:43,670
the Best Female Newcomer Award.

477
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:45,439
Can you practice right away?

478
00:35:46,339 --> 00:35:49,209
Thank you. Thank you so much.

479
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:51,139
You should thank Ji Sun.

480
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:52,956
I agreed to her offer
since she promised...

481
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,620
we can always
hold our team dinners there.

482
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:56,649
What?

483
00:35:57,410 --> 00:35:58,480
You didn't know?

484
00:36:01,019 --> 00:36:02,850
I guess you really didn't know.

485
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:04,589
Oh, then...

486
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:10,406
Then you're letting me work here
because Ji Sun promised you...

487
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:11,766
that you can eat free
at her restaurant?

488
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:15,399
Well, I guess that's what you call
helping each other out.

489
00:36:19,569 --> 00:36:21,339
Excuse me, but...

490
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:24,269
I can't work this way.

491
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:26,110
I won't do it.

492
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:29,985
Even if I was humiliated
in front of the whole nation...

493
00:36:30,009 --> 00:36:31,850
and fired from my previous job,

494
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:34,680
I'm not cheap enough to be
used like this for free food.

495
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:37,819
What do you think you're doing?

496
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:40,459
I went through hoops
to persuade our producer.

497
00:36:41,959 --> 00:36:43,189
Anyhow, I won't do it.

498
00:36:44,089 --> 00:36:45,706
You failed all your auditions,

499
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:47,529
yet you still don't know your place.

500
00:36:49,129 --> 00:36:51,899
I do know my place.
That's why I won't do it.

501
00:36:52,269 --> 00:36:54,340
You really are a lunatic,
just like the rumors.

502
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:55,547
Look here.

503
00:36:55,571 --> 00:36:56,785
Do you think you failed
your auditions...

504
00:36:56,809 --> 00:36:58,145
merely because of drunk driving?

505
00:36:58,169 --> 00:36:59,456
You're totally mistaken.

506
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,316
It's because you're a total lunatic.

507
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:03,260
Don't you know everyone
in this field knows that?

508
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:28,370
If felt as if
I was staring at someone else.

509
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,210
When I saw my reflection,

510
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,279
I saw someone whom
I had never seen before.

511
00:37:35,809 --> 00:37:38,179
Why do you think
I suddenly felt that way?

512
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:42,080
Maybe you wanted to deny
your recent life.

513
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:47,490
I didn't know...

514
00:37:48,259 --> 00:37:50,830
I made people feel so uncomfortable.

515
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:55,330
After I got mad, I was always
the first to apologize.

516
00:37:55,929 --> 00:37:57,500
Even if it wasn't my fault.

517
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,940
And everyone said it was okay.

518
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:03,490
But I guess they didn't mean it.

519
00:38:04,139 --> 00:38:06,009
No matter how small it is,

520
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:08,740
getting rid of a wound
is not as easy as you think.

521
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:13,679
I guess I really am a lunatic.

522
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:20,190
Dr. Ji. I'm thinking of
leaving this field for a while.

523
00:38:21,889 --> 00:38:23,429
Do you have plans on what you'll do?

524
00:38:24,929 --> 00:38:27,775
Someone offered me
a part-time job.

525
00:38:27,799 --> 00:38:29,070
What kind of job is it?

526
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:43,850
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, my gosh.

527
00:38:45,879 --> 00:38:47,855
Did you come to see me?

528
00:38:47,879 --> 00:38:48,879
Yes.

529
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:50,519
Let's go inside.

530

(Eun Kang Medical Center)

531
00:39:01,429 --> 00:39:02,600
Did you make up your mind?

532
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:04,600
About what?

533
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,177
Didn't you come here
to receive treatment?

534
00:39:06,201 --> 00:39:08,299
- No.
- Then?

535
00:39:08,899 --> 00:39:11,409
The part-time job you mentioned
last time.

536
00:39:12,139 --> 00:39:13,699
I'm wondering if the offer
still stands.

537
00:39:14,009 --> 00:39:16,580
You know, stage therapy, was it?

538
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,080
Yes, you're right. Stage therapy.

539
00:39:19,179 --> 00:39:21,726
I still think of
acting in front of Cha Dong Il...

540
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:23,490
from time to time.

541
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:26,919
Strangely, it made me feel better.

542
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:42,870
I want to try it.

543
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,909
Can't I?

544
00:39:52,149 --> 00:39:53,279
This is perfect.

545
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,750
I was concerned about it anyway.

546
00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:59,090
You are my savior.

547
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,690
Really? I'm so glad.

548
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,340
These are some materials
on stage therapy.

549
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:14,840
- Can you start right away?
- Of course.

550
00:40:25,279 --> 00:40:27,580
What's the big deal of
letting them eat for free here?

551
00:40:30,789 --> 00:40:32,189
Are you doing charity or something?

552
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:33,820
That's what you're good at.

553
00:40:36,289 --> 00:40:39,330
What about my pride?
Didn't you think about that?

554
00:40:43,799 --> 00:40:46,470
I thought it was more important
for you to get up on stage.

555
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:49,440
Since you can protect your pride
only when you're on stage.

556
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,740
I appreciate the gesture.

557
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:58,186
But I'm not even going to go near
that place for now.

558
00:40:58,210 --> 00:40:59,255
What are you talking about?

559
00:40:59,279 --> 00:41:00,895
I've decided to work part-time
at the hospital.

560
00:41:00,919 --> 00:41:02,350
What will you do there?

561
00:41:02,889 --> 00:41:05,419
- Stage therapy.
- What is that?

562
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:10,429
People with illnesses
all have trauma.

563
00:41:10,629 --> 00:41:13,149
It's a way to find what it is
by acting out a certain situation.

564
00:41:28,809 --> 00:41:29,909
It's hard for me too.

565
00:41:30,309 --> 00:41:32,110
Is this the time for you
to be like this?

566
00:41:35,649 --> 00:41:38,690
Good job. You did well.

567
00:41:38,889 --> 00:41:40,120
What are you talking about?

568
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,905
Stop getting mad.
They're all like that at their age.

569
00:41:43,929 --> 00:41:47,000
Just leave me alone!
I'll live as I please!

570
00:41:48,059 --> 00:41:50,076
How dare you talk back to
your mom?

571
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,269
Do you want to die?

572
00:42:15,929 --> 00:42:18,659
(Eun Kang Medical Center)

573
00:42:29,639 --> 00:42:30,909
You want to go to college?

574
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:33,909
I told you that you can't go.

575
00:42:34,539 --> 00:42:36,179
I don't have money to afford that.

576
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:41,019
Do you think I'm filthy rich
or something?

577
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:44,690
You don't even want to go to
law school like your older brother.

578
00:42:46,159 --> 00:42:47,990
As long as you live wisely,

579
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:49,365
you can become successful
like me...

580
00:42:49,389 --> 00:42:52,129
even if you don't go to college.

581
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:03,370
How can someone like you
think of going to college?

582
00:43:03,769 --> 00:43:06,355
Hey. With the money
to send you to college,

583
00:43:06,379 --> 00:43:08,509
I'd rather buy your brother
a nice meal.

584
00:43:13,179 --> 00:43:15,889
Stop thinking of
meaningless things...

585
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,789
and get a grip!

586
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:23,360
Min Ho, don't you have
something you want to say?

587
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:25,230
Don't hold back and say it.

588
00:43:27,759 --> 00:43:31,570
Someone like me?
What kind of person is that?

589
00:43:32,799 --> 00:43:33,940
You don't know?

590
00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:37,309
My gosh, you idiot.

591
00:43:37,970 --> 00:43:40,885
I raised you alone all this time
without even your mom.

592
00:43:40,909 --> 00:43:44,779
You should be grateful
and live a proper life.

593
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:47,679
Is there even something
you're good at?

594
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,149
Are you even interested...

595
00:43:51,789 --> 00:43:53,019
in what I'm good at?

596
00:43:58,659 --> 00:43:59,659
Dad.

597
00:44:01,159 --> 00:44:02,360
I'm a person.

598
00:44:04,029 --> 00:44:05,269
I'm a person too.

599
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:11,210
I'm your son too!

600
00:44:12,309 --> 00:44:14,639
Yes, you are a son too.
Say it bravely.

601
00:44:15,039 --> 00:44:17,186
Don't you have something to say
to your dad? Go on and say it.

602
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:18,610
Why do you only look at my brother?

603
00:44:19,049 --> 00:44:20,379
Why can't you see me?

604
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,726
I'm not a ghost.

605
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:24,750
Stop treating me like I'm invisible.

606
00:44:25,049 --> 00:44:27,395
Be more specific.
He can't understand you.

607
00:44:27,419 --> 00:44:28,690
When I was 12,

608
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:30,666
you don't know I ran away
from home...

609
00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:32,230
because I was so lonely, do you?

610
00:44:33,799 --> 00:44:35,929
I thought you'd look for me, Dad.

611
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,070
I wandered the streets for a week,

612
00:44:40,039 --> 00:44:42,500
then returned home because
I couldn't take it anymore.

613
00:44:43,039 --> 00:44:44,169
Dad...

614
00:44:46,679 --> 00:44:48,840
You didn't even know I'd been gone.

615
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:51,056
My brother had won some award,

616
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,179
and you took just him
out for dinner!

617
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:56,389
I was so hungry...

618
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,789
but there was nothing to eat.

619
00:45:02,690 --> 00:45:03,759
So I ate...

620
00:45:04,990 --> 00:45:06,559
tissue soaked in water.

621
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:11,846
I ate it because...

622
00:45:11,870 --> 00:45:14,269
I wanted to die then and there!

623
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:40,230
People who hurt each other...

624
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:42,200
usually aren't strangers.

625
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,670
Like family, lovers, or friends,

626
00:45:48,569 --> 00:45:50,940
they are usually closer than anyone.

627
00:45:56,410 --> 00:45:58,325
- Wasn't that cool?
- Yes.

628
00:45:58,349 --> 00:45:59,626
It was incredible.

629
00:45:59,650 --> 00:46:01,880
I guess this could be a hit.

630
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:03,196
Dr. In.

631
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:04,490
Hello.

632
00:46:05,490 --> 00:46:09,630
Ms. Han. You did so very well today.

633
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:15,075
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

634
00:46:15,099 --> 00:46:16,476
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

635
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,329
- See you.
- Dr. In.

636
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:22,916
We're going for a drink.
Would you like to join us?

637
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:23,946
Next time.

638
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:25,710
Okay then.

639
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:29,109
Let's go.

640
00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:34,549
A human brain has
about 100 billion nerve cells,

641
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:39,190
and the neurotransmitters from them
alter our conscious state.

642
00:46:39,289 --> 00:46:40,466
No way.

643
00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:43,359
Adrenaline is secreted
when we're stressed,

644
00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:47,099
and oxytocin strengthens
our bond with others.

645
00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:50,099
Thank you.

646
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,069
Thanks.

647
00:46:52,099 --> 00:46:53,075
Shall we drink?

648
00:46:53,099 --> 00:46:54,076
- Yes.
- Sure!

649
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:56,186
- Great job.
- Well done!

650
00:46:56,210 --> 00:46:58,470
Dopamine wakes us up,

651
00:46:58,839 --> 00:47:01,440
and GABA calms us down.

652
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:08,825
Oh? How are you? My gosh.

653
00:47:08,849 --> 00:47:10,349
My question is,

654
00:47:10,849 --> 00:47:15,190
how do these neurotransmitters
come to be?

655
00:47:16,230 --> 00:47:17,265
I'm home.

656
00:47:17,289 --> 00:47:19,700
It comes from your feelings.

657
00:47:20,059 --> 00:47:22,230
Where are your feelings or mind?

658
00:47:23,099 --> 00:47:26,740
In ancient times, people believed
the mind was in the brain.

659
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:30,910
Some thought it was on
the diaphragm or under the ribs.

660
00:47:32,609 --> 00:47:35,180
People use the phrase
"to be broken-hearted".

661
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:38,150
Maybe they thought
it was in the heart.

662
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:43,525
Greek philosophers said
the mind was non-material,

663
00:47:43,549 --> 00:47:46,565
so it didn't exist in the body
as flesh and blood.

664
00:47:46,589 --> 00:47:50,230
That's why they said
it doesn't die with the body either.

665
00:47:52,130 --> 00:47:55,200
I agree with the Greek philosophers.

666
00:47:56,569 --> 00:47:59,470
So the mind is the soul,

667
00:48:00,039 --> 00:48:02,599
and I'm a repairman.

668
00:48:08,309 --> 00:48:10,349
I'm sorry for calling you over.

669
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:15,950
I was going to hire a driver,
but I had something to tell you too.

670
00:48:16,190 --> 00:48:18,220
It's fine. We go in
the same direction.

671
00:48:20,059 --> 00:48:23,265
You know Hwang Bo Young, right?
She's your patient.

672
00:48:23,289 --> 00:48:25,065
Do you know her too?

673
00:48:25,089 --> 00:48:28,930
Yes. She's practically
a hospital family.

674
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:31,930
You didn't know.

675
00:48:32,029 --> 00:48:33,045
I didn't.

676
00:48:33,069 --> 00:48:34,900
How are you treating her?

677
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:37,716
I don't think she's taking
the medicine I prescribed.

678
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:39,585
We're not getting anywhere.

679
00:48:39,609 --> 00:48:42,710
Shouldn't psychotherapy come first
when treating anorexia?

680
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:46,956
I'm doing both at the same time.

681
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:48,849
Anorexia can't be cured.

682
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:50,426
You know, don't you?

683
00:48:50,450 --> 00:48:51,450
I do.

684
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:56,289
Don't you think anorexia should be
treated with Si Joon's method?

685
00:49:00,599 --> 00:49:03,575
I'm sure you'll do what's best,

686
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:08,299
but people we know personally
tend to pick on minute details.

687
00:49:08,599 --> 00:49:11,670
I trust you, of course.

688
00:49:12,009 --> 00:49:13,180
You know that, right?

Ask if Ms. Hwang Bo Young
can attend.

Okay, I will. Bye.

interested in stage therapy?

Do I really have to meet my dad?

There's something
you want to say to him.

705
00:51:26,039 --> 00:51:27,440
You must say it in person.

706
00:51:32,809 --> 00:51:34,150
See a psychiatrist?

707
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:38,220
I guess you're spoiled.
Do we have money to waste?

708

There's something Min Ho
really wishes to say to you.

Would you like to hear him out?

710

be quick. I'm busy.

Min Ho.

Dad.

713
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:01,809
When I was 10 years old,

714
00:52:03,950 --> 00:52:08,079
you woke me up and scolded me.

715
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:10,819
For stealing money from your wallet.

716
00:52:11,289 --> 00:52:13,160
I kept saying it wasn't me,

717
00:52:13,690 --> 00:52:15,390
but you told me not to lie.

718
00:52:15,690 --> 00:52:17,759
It really wasn't me.

719
00:52:17,890 --> 00:52:21,035
I really didn't steal your money.

720
00:52:21,059 --> 00:52:22,430
You crazy...

721
00:52:23,769 --> 00:52:25,599
Did you come here to say that?

722
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:27,376
That was years ago.

723
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:28,440
I felt wronged.

724
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,640
Until now,

725
00:52:33,339 --> 00:52:35,380
that stayed with me right here.

726
00:52:36,309 --> 00:52:37,750
I felt wronged!

727
00:52:38,109 --> 00:52:40,279
You pathetic fool.

728
00:52:40,819 --> 00:52:44,289
Your older brother told me that
he took the money.

729
00:52:44,490 --> 00:52:47,720
Why do you still
hold that inside at your age?

730
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:50,759
That's why you're the mess you are.

Dr. Lee.

733

My dad...

734
00:53:24,289 --> 00:53:25,490
has dentures.

735
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:29,759
I didn't think he'd have that.

736
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:32,976
You had no idea?

737
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,500
I never imagined it.

738
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:42,109
All the dads in the world...

739
00:53:42,339 --> 00:53:46,150
become smaller,
their hair turn white,

740
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:48,049
and they lose teeth.

741
00:53:48,579 --> 00:53:53,319
Your father isn't
the scary man he used to be.

742
00:53:56,930 --> 00:53:59,289
I won't tell you to understand him.

743
00:54:01,099 --> 00:54:02,630
The treatment begins now.

744
00:54:04,329 --> 00:54:07,240
We'll start by building up
the self-esteem you lost.

745
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:12,970
Okay.

746
00:54:18,710 --> 00:54:22,980
Before we begin, let's
close our eyes for a few seconds...

747
00:54:23,589 --> 00:54:26,960
and feel the air in this room.

748
00:54:40,039 --> 00:54:41,470
Ms. Han Woo Joo's here too.

749
00:54:41,869 --> 00:54:43,710
I guess she's here to help.

750
00:54:44,539 --> 00:54:45,539

751
00:54:45,869 --> 00:54:47,940

You all look a bit brighter.

753

Shall we begin, then?

754
00:54:57,349 --> 00:54:58,366
You first.

755
00:54:58,390 --> 00:55:02,119
I have anorexia nervosa.

756
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:04,890
I was a model,

757
00:55:05,789 --> 00:55:07,275
but I gain weight...

758
00:55:07,299 --> 00:55:08,759
even when I drink water.

759
00:55:09,299 --> 00:55:11,005
I got stressed out that...

760
00:55:11,029 --> 00:55:12,545
I'd become too fat to work,

761
00:55:12,569 --> 00:55:15,769
and now I feel afraid
just looking at food.

762
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:19,916
It's a load of nonsense that
water makes you gain weight.

763
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:21,710
Why would people in Africa starve...

764
00:55:21,910 --> 00:55:23,309
if water would make them fat?

765
00:55:25,849 --> 00:55:27,579
Thank you for sharing.

766
00:55:28,250 --> 00:55:29,279
How about you?

767
00:55:31,390 --> 00:55:33,835
I'm being treated for
binge eating...

768
00:55:33,859 --> 00:55:35,059
while looking for a job.

769
00:55:35,420 --> 00:55:37,990
I applied to over 100 jobs so far,

770
00:55:38,259 --> 00:55:40,160
and that's how
I started binge eating.

771
00:55:40,329 --> 00:55:43,000
Once I start to eat, I can't stop.

772
00:55:43,529 --> 00:55:46,075
Whenever I see food,
I must shove it in my mouth...

773
00:55:46,099 --> 00:55:47,500
and chew to feel better.

774
00:55:48,269 --> 00:55:51,269
If you keep that weight on,
you'll never get a job.

775
00:55:52,970 --> 00:55:55,680
What are you... Don't say that.

776
00:55:58,849 --> 00:55:59,910
You two.

777
00:56:01,049 --> 00:56:03,490
Thanks so much
for having the courage to share.

778

779
00:56:14,230 --> 00:56:15,805
What do you have?

780
00:56:15,829 --> 00:56:16,930
Anorexia.

781
00:56:17,470 --> 00:56:19,106
I eat, puke, eat, puke.

782
00:56:19,130 --> 00:56:20,369
Why is that?

783
00:56:22,039 --> 00:56:23,940
My mom treats me like I'm a doll.

784
00:56:26,069 --> 00:56:27,410
But I'm not a doll.

785
00:56:29,109 --> 00:56:32,049
So, to show my mom
I'm not a doll,

786
00:56:32,809 --> 00:56:34,579
I throw up in front of her.

787
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:37,490
I do that to torture her.

788
00:56:42,259 --> 00:56:43,789
You're so spoiled.

789
00:56:46,430 --> 00:56:47,407
What?

790
00:56:47,431 --> 00:56:49,130
You don't know what's precious.

791
00:56:50,130 --> 00:56:52,045
Torturing your mom is your goal?

792
00:56:52,069 --> 00:56:53,670
What do you know to say that?

793
00:56:53,839 --> 00:56:55,116
I was abused!

794
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:56,970
You're being childish!

795
00:56:57,210 --> 00:56:59,146
Dr. In. They might end up fighting.

Some people crave that
all their lives.

797
00:57:01,109 --> 00:57:02,255
Shouldn't we stop them?

798
00:57:02,279 --> 00:57:05,255
The streets are
full of people who try...

799
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:08,549
so darn hard to get noticed
while nobody cares!

800
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:11,696
So don't do something
you'll regret...

801
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:14,519
and live your life properly
and be grateful for it.

802
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:30,039
How about a round of applause?

803

Woo Joo. You're done already?

804
00:57:49,059 --> 00:57:51,690
I was hoping to watch. I'm too late.

805

How did it go today?

806
00:57:56,930 --> 00:57:59,069
What's wrong?
Is something the matter?

807
00:57:59,230 --> 00:58:01,140
I'm sorry. I ruined everything.

808
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:02,640
What?

809
00:58:03,609 --> 00:58:06,410
I don't think I can do this.

I'd like fried chicken, please.

814

Will you keep coming here?

815
00:59:01,299 --> 00:59:04,569
I haven't yet found a place
that sells chicken this good.

816

Why do you keep
coming here to see me?

818

Do you do this on purpose?
To make me feel bad?

819
00:59:16,809 --> 00:59:18,880
From when I was 6 until I turned 12.

820
00:59:20,650 --> 00:59:22,650
You raised me for six years.

821
00:59:23,650 --> 00:59:25,349
I miss you sometimes, Mom.

822
00:59:26,289 --> 00:59:27,619
I'm not your mom.

823
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:29,720
Mom.

824
00:59:32,589 --> 00:59:33,700
Back then.

825
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:38,470
I'm really sorry about that.

826
00:59:40,069 --> 00:59:41,170
Stop it.

827
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:43,970
I forgot the past because
I'm busy making a living.

828
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:48,309
Leave when you're done.

829
01:00:47,069 --> 01:00:49,700
Woo Joo. What are you doing here?

830
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:51,869
How did you find this place?

831
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:56,410
I thought I'd never
get to tell you if not now.

832
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:03,119
You're right.

833
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:06,049
I'm a patient.

834
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:10,390
Please treat me.

835
01:01:12,190 --> 01:01:13,529
You can, can't you?

836
01:01:31,049 --> 01:01:33,920
(Fix You)

837
01:01:34,279 --> 01:01:38,490
Woo Joo. You changed
other people's lives.

838
01:01:38,990 --> 01:01:39,967
Hey!

839
01:01:39,991 --> 01:01:41,595
Hand him over to Dong Hyuk.

840
01:01:41,619 --> 01:01:42,835
He's my patient.

841
01:01:42,859 --> 01:01:44,589
You ignored all protocols.

842
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:46,930
Why are you
so obsessed with the patient?

843
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:48,829
Hey, hey. Hey!

844
01:01:49,029 --> 01:01:50,930
Why do you still wear
the watch I gave you?

845
01:01:51,170 --> 01:01:53,900
What if Han Woo Joo is borderline?

846
01:01:54,769 --> 01:01:56,900
We'll carry out
a search and seizure.

847
01:01:57,039 --> 01:01:59,809
Do you have any idea
why they had a warrant?

848
01:02:00,339 --> 01:02:01,985
Someone planned this.

849
01:02:02,009 --> 01:02:03,555
A burial or drowning. Which one?

850
01:02:03,579 --> 01:02:05,349
- Or a cremation?
- What?
