<b>The patient left this behind.</b>

34
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:23,780
<b>Do you want to marry me?</b>

35
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,060
<b>It was my way of thanking you.</b>

36
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:35,060
<b>I felt grateful enough to even propose to you.</b>

37

39

<b>No, not really.</b>

40
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,570
<b>I see.</b>

41
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,610
<b>You don't get it.</b>

42
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,910
<b>I guess I should've gone with the common route then.</b>

43
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,540
<b>Anyway, I'm grateful.</b>

44
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,640
<b>I'd even be more grateful...</b>

45

<b>if you could forget about everything that just happened as well.</b>

46

<b>But...</b>

47
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,650
<b>You don't seem to be thinking clearly.</b>

48
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:02,690
<b>Can I give you a lift?</b>

49
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:05,960
<b>No, I'm good. I'm back to normal, so you can go.</b>

50
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:08,930
<b>- Ms. Jang... - I'm fine, so...</b>

51
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,540
<b>You're a polite one, aren't you?</b>

52
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,480

53

<b>Get back down here and let me do it.</b>

54

<b>Unbelievable.</b>

55
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:43,390
<b>I know how to replace a light bulb, you know.</b>

56
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,260
<b>Why would I let you have the pleasure?</b>

57
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,760
<b>Go back to watching the baby.</b>

58
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,830
<b>I find you cool either way,</b>

59
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,670
<b>so let me do the grunt work around here.</b>

60
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:52,970
<b>That's not why I asked you to come live with us.</b>

61

<b>The women in this family managed without a man for over 30 years.</b>

62
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:57,440
<b>Don't even think about being our handyman.</b>

63
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:00,140
<b>How can I not when I'm the only guy...</b>

64
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,610
<b>around the house?</b>

65
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,050
<b>The cutlery is what you'll grab.</b>

66
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:04,750
<b>That's how it is at your mother-in-law's.</b>

67
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,780
<b>My mother-in-law?</b>

68
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,750
<b>I'm just saying we're as close as that.</b>

69
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:15,230
<b>And have Ha Ri help raise Do Ah.</b>

70
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,630
<b>She'll do a good job.</b>

71
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,500
<b>Why would I ask her that?</b>

72
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:22,770
<b>As a stepmother...</b>

73
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:24,830
<b>"A stepmother"?</b>

74
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:29,240
<b>- We're a family again, aren't we? - Right.</b>

75
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,780
<b>Anyway, she just adores kids.</b>

76
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,310
<b>She's great at babysitting them too.</b>

77
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:39,920
<b>I know that, but why would I...</b>

78
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,920
<b>Here. Drink this.</b>

79
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,990
<b>Gosh, thank you. You didn't have to.</b>

80
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:48,190
<b>You need to go back to how you were.</b>

81
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,290
<b>It's herbal medicine.</b>

82
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:55,130
<b>You should've lived a good life, not come back as a scruffy dog.</b>

83
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,610
<b>Mom!</b>

84
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:06,270
<b>- Say goodbye. - Bye!</b>

85
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,670
<b>Really?</b>

<b>(My mom Ms. Ok Ran)</b>

87
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:25,620
<b>Yes, Mom?</b>

88
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,560
<b>Are you busy?</b>

89
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,230
<b>Not really.</b>

90
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,160
<b>Can you make it to Eun Joo's wedding this weekend?</b>

91
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,870
<b>I have a deadline to meet.</b>

92
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,700
<b>You'll be done by then.</b>

93
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,940
<b>Swing by if you can. Your aunt will be devastated.</b>

94
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:45,810
<b>I'll see what I can do.</b>

95
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:48,040
<b>You'll do what?</b>

96
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,810
<b>Did you know that you always use your deadline as an excuse?</b>

97
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,450
<b>Even your aunt knows that...</b>

98
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:54,880
<b>you're deliberately skipping weddings and kids' birthday parties.</b>

99
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:57,090
<b>It serves you right for letting...</b>

100
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:58,290
<b>your younger cousins get married first.</b>

101
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:04,890
<b>Missing family events like this only make them pity you more.</b>

102
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:08,500
<b>You should attend them with your head held up high.</b>

103
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,370
<b>- I... - Got it?</b>

104
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,270
<b>I didn't commit a crime, you know.</b>

105
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:14,640
<b>Why do you think I'd feel ashamed?</b>

106
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:18,510
<b>Can I only hold my head up high if I'm married with kids?</b>

107
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:22,280
<b>Okay, fine.</b>

108
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,650
<b>Mom, I...</b>

109
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,120
<b>What was that?</b>

110
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:35,190
<b>I'll have dinner ready, so don't be late.</b>

111
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:36,990
<b>Whatever. I'm hanging up.</b>

112
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:09,390
<b>Ha Ri!</b>

113
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:10,890
<b>What took you so long?</b>

114
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:13,500
<b>Ms. Shim is shooting lasers out of her eyes.</b>

115
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,940
<b>Right, of course.</b>

116
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:23,840
<b>Sure.</b>

117
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,140
<b>Ms. Shim, you're back.</b>

118
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,250
<b>I thought you had another week off.</b>

119
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,110
<b>How can I stay home when this is happening?</b>

120
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,050
<b>But the issue was solved.</b>

121
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,820
<b>Leave the Advertising Department to solve their own problems.</b>

122
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:38,990
<b>Why did you agree to wear the fake pregnant belly?</b>

123
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,990
<b>Still, it led to a deal.</b>

124
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,460
<b>Then take care of the Eggo photo shoot too.</b>

125
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:44,990
<b>Sorry?</b>

126
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:46,930
<b>Eggo said they wouldn't be renewing their contract,</b>

127
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:49,230
<b>so it's up to you to get them to sign with us again.</b>

128
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:50,600
<b>Send Ha Ri the related materials.</b>

129
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:54,270
<b>What? But I worked hard casting Na Eun as the model for this.</b>

130
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:56,470
<b>Why would that fall on my lap?</b>

131
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,040
<b>Why do you keep throwing projects at me?</b>

132
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,180
<b>I'm not in the Advertising Department...</b>

133
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,380
<b>If you want to patronize...</b>

134
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:06,350
<b>and order subordinates around, be the editor-in-chief yourself.</b>

135
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,280
<b>I didn't cut my baby's breastfeeding short...</b>

136

<b>just to hear you talk back at me!</b>

137
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,330
<b>I'll call it a day for now and get begging tomorrow.</b>

138
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,010
<b>Back to work, guys.</b>

139
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,960
<b>Gyeong Jin's getting married next month.</b>

140
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,930
<b>Tell me about it.</b>

141
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:52,130
<b>Everyone's finally getting married one by one.</b>

142
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,760
<b>Myeong Sook's son...</b>

143
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,730
<b>- got into Sehan University. - I know.</b>

144
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,130
<b>Is your daughter...</b>

145
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:59,240
<b>- a high school senior this year? - That's right.</b>

146
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:02,610
<b>- Gosh, time sure flies. - Tell me about it.</b>

147
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:10,780
<b>(Episode 2: Am I on the Right Path?)</b>

148

<b>Is she asleep? Why are all the lights off?</b>

149
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,860
<b>Gosh.</b>

150
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,270
<b>What on earth?</b>

151
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,600
<b>What are you up to?</b>

152
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:39,480
<b>You just can't be normal, can you?</b>

153
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,540
<b>Unbelievable. Here you go.</b>

154
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:44,110
<b>It's for you.</b>

155
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:45,750
<b>Your cousin's getting married.</b>

156
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,880
<b>It seems to be easy for everyone else.</b>

157
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:52,960
<b>That must be why you seem a little depressed.</b>

158
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:55,060
<b>Not really.</b>

159
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,230
<b>In my 20s, I thought marriage would happen to me naturally.</b>

160
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,400
<b>When I reached my 30s though, it became a test.</b>

161
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,430
<b>I needed to study about men, how to date them,</b>

162
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,530
<b>and go on blind dates that felt like interviews.</b>

163
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,970
<b>I'm about to turn 40 now,</b>

164
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:12,740
<b>and I learned that my efforts won't take me down the aisle.</b>

165
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,880
<b>What do I do?</b>

166
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:18,750
<b>What else? You can just give up.</b>

167
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:21,780
<b>If life happens as we want it to, no one would have a crappy life.</b>

168
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,050
<b>I might be in a different place...</b>

169
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,920
<b>if I had put in a little more effort though.</b>

170
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,590
<b>Well...</b>

171
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,490
<b>Anyway, I'm regretting my yesterdays...</b>

172
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:33,730
<b>and hoping that I don't lose my chance tomorrow.</b>

173
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,630
<b>Your life isn't so bad...</b>

174
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,700
<b>Forget it.</b>

175
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,640
<b>So what's up with your belly?</b>

176
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,910
<b>Gosh, get that out of there.</b>

177
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,010
<b>Let it be.</b>

178
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:51,080
<b>This is what I regret and what I might lose tomorrow.</b>

179
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,320
<b>I'd rather mope around like this a little more.</b>

180
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,390
<b>Sure, whatever.</b>

181
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,760
<b>Good luck then.</b>

182
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,190
<b>Unbelievable.</b>

183
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,210
<b>Gosh.</b>

184
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,950
<b>I came by to ask for a favor,</b>

185
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:24,650
<b>but you're in no position to help me.</b>

186
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:26,780
<b>What kind of a favor is it?</b>

187
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:30,350
<b>Ha Ri might grow old all alone at this rate.</b>

188
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:31,990
<b>She doesn't seem to want to get married.</b>

189
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,990
<b>All she cares about is her job now.</b>

190
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,790
<b>What if she lives a lonely life forever?</b>

191
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:39,230
<b>She wouldn't be lonely.</b>

192
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:42,000
<b>She'll find someone and live happily ever after.</b>

193
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:45,900
<b>Jae Young. Stay by her side...</b>

194
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,240
<b>and be with her.</b>

195
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,340
<b>You need to live with people to find new people.</b>

196
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,880
<b>If you two grow on each other, you can settle down together.</b>

197
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,710
<b>How could you say something so frightening?</b>

198
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,250
<b>- Is Ha Ri frightening? - Come on.</b>

199
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,190
<b>Think about it.</b>

200
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:07,490
<b>She and I are like brother and sister.</b>

201
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,290
<b>Exactly. I'm saying...</b>

202
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:11,590
<b>be close like you're brother and sister.</b>

203
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,170
<b>Darn it.</b>

204
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:30,210
<b>Seriously. She keeps worrying me.</b>

205
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,120
<b>Hey, get up. Let's have some soju.</b>

206
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,190
<b>Get up!</b>

207
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,620
<b>Get off.</b>

208
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:40,620
<b>Fine, you have beer.</b>

209
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,790
<b>Why you little...</b>

210
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:46,060
<b>What are you doing? Slapstick? Your face is funny enough.</b>

211
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,470
<b>Hey.</b>

212
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:53,540
<b>Take this and go. Don't come back.</b>

213
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:54,600
<b>What is this?</b>

214
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,840
<b>Do Ah's pajamas. It's a parting gift.</b>

215
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:59,310
<b>Bye. Let's never meet again. Go.</b>

216
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:01,210
<b>Why did you buy this?</b>

217
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:03,880
<b>I bought you that, so leave. I don't want to look at you.</b>

218
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,110
<b>Go.</b>

219
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,380
<b>I don't think it'll work with me. That's our destiny.</b>

220
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:10,650
<b>What are you babbling about? Go.</b>

221
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:14,490
<b>Since you gave me a gift,</b>

222
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,900
<b>should I set you up with a guy?</b>

223
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:30,110
<b>When did I say I needed a guy?</b>

224
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:37,450
<b>Do you really not?</b>

225
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,280
<b>You seemed to be kicking yourself for not trying hard enough.</b>

226
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,190
<b>Well...</b>

227
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:49,260
<b>I think it may be too soon to give up, but...</b>

228
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:51,030
<b>So? Should I set you up?</b>

229
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,900
<b>It's okay.</b>

230
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:59,540
<b>There's no guarantee that I'll meet a nice guy just because I try.</b>

231
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:02,500
<b>Well, if you know someone...</b>

232
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:04,970
<b>who looks nice,</b>

233
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:07,210
<b>is a good person,</b>

234
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:09,040
<b>and has a good sense of humor...</b>

235
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:12,310
<b>I don't care about looks, so an average guy will do.</b>

236
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,680
<b>But you wouldn't know anyone like that.</b>

237
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,790
<b>What was that? Is that a yes or no?</b>

238
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:20,390
<b>Are you saying yes if I know someone like that?</b>

239
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:22,220
<b>If you do, you can try setting me up.</b>

240
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:27,830
<b>There are too many voices inside of you, right?</b>

241
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,330
<b>Just stick to one.</b>

242
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,270
<b>Thanks for the pajamas.</b>

243
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:35,170
<b>Brush your teeth and go to sleep.</b>

<b>A seven-percent probability to get naturally pregnant...</b>

<b>Why?</b>

<b>I'll set my schedule to avoid the times you're there.</b>

<b>Are you still uncomfortable with me?</b>

310

<b>It would be weird if I were comfortable.</b>

311
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,480
<b>You told me to just get a dog when we first met.</b>

312

<b>If you look at it that way,</b>

00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:50,950
<b>- About what? - Don't you remember?</b>

315
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,520
<b>What would offend...</b>

316
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,390
<b>Hey.</b>

317
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,860
<b>Hey. Where are you going?</b>

318
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:31,160
<b>What's wrong with you?</b>

319
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:34,000
<b>Sit down. Sit.</b>

320
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,580
<b>Do you despise women?</b>

321
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:50,450
<b>- What? - You said,</b>

322
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:52,980
<b>if a woman shows interest,</b>

323
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:55,520
<b>it was because of this and that.</b>

324
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,050
<b>Isn't that the same thing?</b>

325
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:02,220
<b>How did you develop such a twisted prejudice?</b>

326
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:06,360
<b>I'm about to develop a prejudice.</b>

327
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:16,070
<b>Do you think I don't understand because I'm drunk?</b>

328
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:19,570
<b>You're saying you don't like me.</b>

329
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:22,580
<b>I don't like you either.</b>

330
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:27,380
<b>Had I known you were a psycho, I wouldn't have mustered up courage.</b>

331
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:34,220
<b>You read me correctly.</b>

332
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,330
<b>I'm not the guy you're looking for.</b>

333
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:43,300
<b>What if you fall for me?</b>

334
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:49,300
<b>I swear you'll fall for me.</b>

335
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:54,240
<b>Who gets drunk enough to say something like that?</b>

336
00:23:57,910 --> 00:24:02,180
<b>You told me I'd fall for you.</b>

337
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:05,390
<b>- So did you fall for me? - No.</b>

338
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:06,790
<b>- Do you plan to? - No.</b>

339
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:07,960
<b>Then what's your point?</b>

340
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:11,390
<b>Why are you taking it out on me?</b>

341
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:13,300
<b>You're the one who guaranteed it.</b>

342
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,800
<b>Anyway, I'll do my best to avoid you so things don't get awkward.</b>

343
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,370
<b>- I expect you to cooperate as well. - Sure.</b>

344
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:24,140
<b>Let's try our best not to run into each other.</b>

345
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:27,480
<b>- Okay. - That was nice and easy.</b>

346
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,280
<b>Here. This is for my drink.</b>

347
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:40,390
<b>What do you mean the photographer isn't here?</b>

348
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:42,890
<b>I have an interview with Yeon Ho.</b>

349
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:44,830
<b>Why isn't anyone here yet?</b>

350
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:46,030
<b>They're coming.</b>

351
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:49,000
<b>It's going to take over an hour to set things up and do the shoot.</b>

352
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,070
<b>Yeon Ho is interviewing a famous photographer from abroad.</b>

353
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:53,440
<b>I can't do both.</b>

354
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,840
<b>It's a cover shoot.</b>

355
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,640
<b>I can't postpone it. We also need to do a video shoot.</b>

356
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:01,140
<b>I had a really hard time casting Na Eun.</b>

357
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,010
<b>You know how popular she is these days.</b>

358
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:05,350
<b>- Aunt. - Did you hear that? Even guys...</b>

359
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:08,680
<b>I must be crazy.</b>

360
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,750
<b>Hello, I'm Choi Kang Eu Ddeum from the Advertising Team.</b>

361
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,160
<b>You were an idol star, weren't you?</b>

362
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,460
<b>You seem very familiar.</b>

363
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:21,000
<b>No, my last name is made up with both of my parents' last names.</b>

364
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,300
<b>You have two last names?</b>

365
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,000
<b>Eu Ddeum, what are you doing here?</b>

366
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,900
<b>Mr. Kim told me it's a very important client...</b>

367
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,740
<b>and that I should help you get a contract renewal.</b>

368
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:30,570
<b>He sent you here to deal with an important client?</b>

369
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,410
<b>I didn't know he trusted me so much either.</b>

370
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,280
<b>I promise I'll do my best to help.</b>

371
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:39,010
<b>Ha Ri, I don't have time. You need to make a choice.</b>

372
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,620
<b>No, I don't want to.</b>

373
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:53,290
<b>You don't want to?</b>

374
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,920
<b>That means you still can.</b>

375
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,390
<b>Can you help us just this once?</b>

376
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:59,530
<b>You do your job, and I'll do mine.</b>

377
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:01,530
<b>I'm only here to share your working space.</b>

378
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,500
<b>This is a great part-time job.</b>

379
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,000
<b>You can make money, get good practice,</b>

380
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,370
<b>and get the hang of it again.</b>

381
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,470
<b>Why would he practice with our cover shoot?</b>

382
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:11,210
<b>It's just a figure of speech.</b>

383
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:13,410
<b>Forget it. That's enough.</b>

384
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:14,940
<b>We're stooping too low.</b>

385
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:22,520
<b>I'm sorry for asking you a favor when I promised to avoid you.</b>

386
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:30,390
<b>But did you have to make us talk facing your back?</b>

387
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:33,430
<b>It's not like you have a really broad back anyway.</b>

388
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:42,200
<b>Gosh.</b>

389
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:45,340
<b>Hey, you're here. You came a long way.</b>

390
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:47,880
<b>- Hi. - Hello.</b>

391
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:50,210
<b>Gosh, they're here. My goodness.</b>

392
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,050
<b>Hey, give me the draft.</b>

393
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:57,650
<b>We don't have time.</b>

394
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:02,490
<b>Na Eun, you can stand right here.</b>

395
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,160
<b>Hurry up. We don't have time.</b>

396
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,860
<b>There's not much time, so I'll make it quick.</b>

397
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:11,530
<b>This is harmless to humans, so kids can suck on it.</b>

398
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:13,670
<b>Hey, don't put it in your mouth. It's dirty.</b>

399
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:14,870
<b>It's filthy.</b>

400
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,370
<b>Gosh, how dirty.</b>

401
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:23,950
<b>Is there anything else you'd like us to emphasize?</b>

402
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:26,150
<b>Right. And let's see.</b>

403
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,420
<b>It's very durable.</b>

404
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,720
<b>Kids sometimes throw stuff,</b>

405
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,890
<b>but it doesn't break that easily.</b>

406
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:37,830
<b>This is so weak.</b>

407
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,530
<b>And... And what else is there?</b>

408
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,570
<b>I have to urgently go somewhere.</b>

409
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,400
<b>Can you assemble everything back together?</b>

410
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:52,670
<b>Yes, of course. I can do it with my eyes closed.</b>

411
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:55,740
<b>- Don't worry. - Okay, thank you in advance.</b>

412
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,280
<b>- Sure. You should go. - Okay.</b>

413
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,380
<b>Bye.</b>

414
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,290
<b>How much time do we have left?</b>

415
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:08,560
<b>Seung Ho. Seung Ho, wake up!</b>

416
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:09,890
<b>What time is it?</b>

417
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:11,860
<b>- 3:50pm. - We have 10 minutes left.</b>

418
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:14,500
<b>- Gosh, my hands are shaking. - We can do it.</b>

419
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,900
<b>My goodness.</b>

420
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:20,440
<b>Aunt, is this how you do it?</b>

421
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:24,140
<b>I'm really busy right now. Will you please leave me alone?</b>

422
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:25,540
<b>Ha Ri.</b>

423
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:28,610
<b>I think you should take a look.</b>

424
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,050
<b>Is this how you do it?</b>

425
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,790
<b>You look adorable.</b>

426
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,890
<b>No, I can't do this. There's no time.</b>

427
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,690
<b>What are you doing?</b>

428
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:48,860
<b>I really need to go to Yeon Ho's interview on time.</b>

429
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,830
<b>If I'm late to this one, it'll be an international embarrassment.</b>

430
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,000
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

431
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,470
<b>- I can't... - We can't postpone this one.</b>

432
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:55,800
<b>- Please. - I have to go.</b>

433
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,940
<b>Please just take a couple of photos.</b>

434
00:28:57,010 --> 00:28:58,110
<b>Give me the draft.</b>

435
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:04,080
<b>I don't like babies.</b>

436
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,550
<b>So you can be the one to make her smile.</b>

437
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,050
<b>What do I need to do?</b>

438
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:13,320
<b>She's a baby model, so make sure she smiles.</b>

439
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,720
<b>And the toys need to show.</b>

440
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,930
<b>The draft is right here. Do me a favor.</b>

441
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:19,030
<b>I'm sorry. Thank you, I Sang.</b>

442
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:20,400
<b>Sorry!</b>

443
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,540
<b>You're adorable! Look over here!</b>

444
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:33,270
<b>Na Eun, raise your hand! Smile!</b>

445
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,680
<b>Hey, can you smile a little?</b>

446
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,120
<b>She'll cry because of you.</b>

447
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,750
<b>Does my back still look small to you?</b>

448
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:54,160
<b>It kind of looks broader now.</b>

449
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,030
<b>Na Eun, let me join you!</b>

450
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:00,140
<b>Hey, look. Na Eun, look at the bubbles.</b>

451
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:02,340
<b>Look how pretty the bubbles are!</b>

452
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,680
<b>What about Mr. Kim in the Publishing Team?</b>

453
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:16,990
<b>People say he's gay.</b>

454
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:21,090
<b>What about Mr. Oh in the Monthly Fashion Team?</b>

455
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:26,360
<b>He's already dating someone.</b>

456
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,070
<b>What are we going to do with Ha Ri?</b>

457
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:31,670
<b>I can't believe there's no one...</b>

458
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,370
<b>to introduce to her.</b>

459
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:40,240
<b>If you date a colleague, you'll have a lot in common,</b>

460
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,340
<b>and it's also great because they understand your hardships.</b>

461
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:45,480
<b>But it's hard to actually date someone in the first place.</b>

462
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,980
<b>Would you date a colleague?</b>

463
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:50,690
<b>Gosh, no way. Our company sucks.</b>

464
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,690
<b>See? She works here,</b>

465
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:56,490
<b>but she wants to date someone who works at a better company.</b>

466
00:30:57,090 --> 00:31:00,460
<b>You normally badmouth your colleagues, not fall in love.</b>

467
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:04,200
<b>Actually, I'm dating Seung Ho in the Camera Team.</b>

468
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:05,670
<b>- Since when? - Since when?</b>

469
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:10,470
<b>I asked him out the day Ha Ri said we'll end up just like her.</b>

470
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:13,440
<b>- You're amazing. - Thanks.</b>

471
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:19,610
<b>Anyway, there's a reason why people don't date their colleagues.</b>

472
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:21,620
<b>But if she fails to find someone outside of work,</b>

473
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,590
<b>we'll have to keep watching her live a sad life.</b>

474
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,170
<b>I know you'll be at the beauty salon.</b>

475
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:40,540
<b>I'm going to Gangnam for business.</b>

476
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,270
<b>I can easily drop by.</b>

477
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,270
<b>Okay. Bye.</b>

478
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:48,740
<b>Ha Ri, are you going on a blind date?</b>

479
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:49,980
<b>No.</b>

480
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:54,750
<b>Oh, I see. But still, you can't carry everything dressed like that.</b>

481
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,790
<b>It's the weekend, so there won't be a lot of empty cabs either.</b>

482
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:59,320
<b>Hey, you should give her a lift. You're also heading to Gangnam.</b>

483
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:01,860
<b>- No, I'm not. - You're not?</b>

484
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,160
<b>Forget it.</b>

485
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,260
<b>I'll see you.</b>

486
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,960
<b>But I'm sure that's heavy.</b>

487
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,470
<b>Or maybe not.</b>

488
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,370
<b>Hey.</b>

489
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,370
<b>I lied earlier. I'm heading that way, so I'll give you a lift.</b>

490
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,610
<b>- No thanks. - I wouldn't mind the company.</b>

491
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:53,780
<b>Well, I would.</b>

492
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,010
<b>I'll park here until you hop in.</b>

493
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:02,320
<b>We should stay clear of each other, so I'll get in the back.</b>

494
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:14,530
<b>Thanks.</b>

495
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,730
<b>Okay.</b>

496
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:30,410
<b>Thanks. Have a good day.</b>

497
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,870
<b>You said you're off to a wedding.</b>

498
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,670
<b>I can drop you off, so hop in.</b>

499
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,480
<b>Must I get the door for you too?</b>

500
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:15,190
<b>Thanks.</b>

501
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:23,000
<b>My cousin is getting married today.</b>

502
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:26,730
<b>You gave me a ride, so why don't you stay for a meal?</b>

503
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,910
<b>- No thanks. - The snow crabs are to die for.</b>

504
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:34,140
<b>I'll treat you to a meal next time then. Thanks.</b>

505
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,320
<b>Snow crabs?</b>

506
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:45,820
<b>- Auntie, congratulations. - Thanks, Ha Ri.</b>

507
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,590
<b>You made time out of your busy schedule?</b>

508
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:49,120
<b>It's true that I've been busy.</b>

509
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,430
<b>Anyway, head that way.</b>

510
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:53,290
<b>- Hello. - I'm so glad you came.</b>

511
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:54,660
<b>Gosh, thank you.</b>

512
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,900
<b>- Ok Ran! - My goodness.</b>

513
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:59,300
<b>The traffic was awful on my way here.</b>

514
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:02,340
<b>I can't believe you look prettier than the bride today.</b>

515
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,870
<b>Exactly. She should've known better.</b>

516
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:07,210
<b>Anyway, congratulations. You must be ecstatic.</b>

517
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,150
<b>Ha Ri said she couldn't come because of a deadline.</b>

518
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,880
<b>You have no idea how sorry she is.</b>

519
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,480
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

520
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:19,220
<b>Ha Ri's already here.</b>

521
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:20,590
<b>She's over there.</b>

522
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,930
<b>Gosh, congratulations.</b>

523
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:30,330
<b>You look stunning.</b>

524
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,370
<b>I sense the tears coming.</b>

525
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:35,340
<b>One might think you raised me.</b>

526
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:37,440
<b>You said you couldn't come.</b>

527
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:39,640
<b>It wasn't easy to free up my schedule.</b>

528
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:41,980
<b>Anyway, I even got you a huge gift.</b>

529
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:43,950
<b>As in what?</b>

530
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:58,130
<b>You should've told me that you were coming.</b>

531
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:00,630
<b>How can I cover for you when you don't tell me things?</b>

532
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,430
<b>Come to think of it, this is where my best shot lies.</b>

533
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,330
<b>Quite a number of bachelors will be here...</b>

534
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,740
<b>and watching the ceremony will plant the idea of marriage.</b>

535
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,370
<b>What on earth are you saying?</b>

536
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,240
<b>Stop shaking your legs.</b>

537
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,610
<b>I'm nervous, that's all.</b>

538
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,350
<b>Why would you be when it's not your wedding?</b>

539
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:29,060
<b>Next, we have a guest performer...</b>

540
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:31,090
<b>who will like to present...</b>

541
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:34,630
<b>a nuptial song to wish the couple's happiness.</b>

542
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:37,430
<b>It's none other than the bride's...</b>

543
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:38,870
<b>- cousin. - Where are you going?</b>

544
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:40,230
<b>Could you join us up here?</b>

545
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:44,940
<b>- What... - Ha Ri?</b>

546
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:47,540
<b>- Honey, goodness. - My gosh.</b>

547
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:53,680
<b>Hello, I'm Eun Joo's older cousin,</b>

548
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,180
<b>Jang Ha Ri.</b>

549
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:59,220
<b>I know I look young to be older than her, but still.</b>

550
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:01,960
<b>I'm only slightly older than her.</b>

551
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:05,130
<b>My singing isn't nowhere near perfect,</b>

552
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:07,500
<b>but I hope you enjoy it...</b>

553
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:10,000
<b>and consider it as...</b>

554
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,100
<b>my way of wishing her...</b>

555
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:13,600
<b>a happy marriage.</b>

556
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,640
<b>Cue, music.</b>

557
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:38,430
<b>Fill me with your love</b>

558
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:42,100
<b>I guess my love needs to be recharged</b>

559
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:46,530
<b>I can't live without you, I really can't</b>

560
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,700
<b>You're my battery that charges my love</b>

561
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:53,110
<b>I don't care if you're not super handsome</b>

562
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:56,710
<b>I don't care if you don't have the fittest body</b>

563
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:00,850
<b>But you who will care for me dearly</b>

564
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:04,020
<b>You are the man of my dreams</b>

565
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,660
<b>Hug me once more</b>

566
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,830
<b>Embrace me in your arms until my heart bursts</b>

567
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:15,460
<b>I guess my love needs to be recharged</b>

568
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,770
<b>That's why you're the one I need</b>

569
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:22,240
<b>Fill me with your love</b>

570
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:26,170
<b>I guess my love needs to be recharged</b>

571
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:30,110
<b>I can't live without you, I really can't</b>

572
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:33,480
<b>You're my battery that charges my love</b>

573
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:48,260
<b>Ms. Jang...</b>

574
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,120
<b>What on earth?</b>

575
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:15,620
<b>Why are you getting in people's way?</b>

576
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:17,660
<b>I'm not blocking anyone's path.</b>

577
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:20,390
<b>But because of you...</b>

578
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,470
<b>Why are you here?</b>

579
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:27,270
<b>My meal ticket.</b>

580
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:33,010
<b>I haven't had snow crabs before.</b>

581
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,340
<b>Only blue crabs.</b>

582
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,250
<b>Thank you.</b>

583
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,750
<b>The dining hall is this way.</b>

584
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:51,360
<b>I was just about to get lucky.</b>

585
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:01,840
<b>Ha Ri, that's enough. You look desperate.</b>

586
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,070
<b>If you know what I'm doing, start looking too.</b>

587
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:07,780
<b>How old is Eun Joo's husband again? 32?</b>

588
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:10,510
<b>Does he have an older brother? A young uncle wouldn't be so bad.</b>

589
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:12,580
<b>Don't embarrass yourself and just eat your meal.</b>

590
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,050
<b>Mom, can you keep an eye on him?</b>

591
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,090
<b>- Sure. - I need to go to the restroom.</b>

592
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:20,860
<b>- Go ahead. - Come to Grandma.</b>

593
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:22,990
<b>What would you like?</b>

594
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:24,990
<b>- Good boy. - Look at him eat.</b>

595
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:26,460
<b>My sweet little puppy.</b>

596
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,530
<b>Your singing was amazing.</b>

597
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,340
<b>Ha Ri, you've got a successful career,</b>

598
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:36,700
<b>so stick to living alone.</b>

599
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,210
<b>You haven't been able to get married or have a child,</b>

600
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:40,940
<b>so living alone would be more comfortable.</b>

601
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:43,740
<b>Who cares if you're a little lonely?</b>

602
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:48,320
<b>Just earn enough money to live in a retirement home.</b>

603
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:51,820
<b>Did you hear about the old people there...</b>

604
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:53,320
<b>getting beat up these days?</b>

605
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:55,260
<b>Only animals would do such a thing.</b>

606
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:56,620
<b>Tell me about it.</b>

607
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,090
<b>Dig in.</b>

608
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,030
<b>I'm going to get married.</b>

609
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:06,470
<b>My mom should be congratulated too, you know.</b>

610
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:09,470
<b>Please set me up with anyone decent you know.</b>

611
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:11,740
<b>Auntie, set a blind date if you find anyone.</b>

612
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:13,910
<b>Got it? Is everyone on board? Good.</b>

613
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:25,420
<b>Goodness, the snow crabs have been served.</b>

614
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:26,790
<b>- What? - Hold on.</b>

615
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:29,560
<b>- The snow crabs? - Auntie, wait.</b>

616
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:31,230
<b>Auntie?</b>

617
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:32,930
<b>Crabs...</b>

618
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:41,900
<b>They care more about the snow crabs than you.</b>

619
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:47,410
<b>Your aunt already set you up with numerous men.</b>

620
00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:50,850
<b>Who would she have left for someone who's close to 40?</b>

621
00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:54,050
<b>No one's been interested in you for a few years now!</b>

622
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:13,130
<b>Anyway, who gets married at a young age these days.</b>

623
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,170
<b>A lot of women marry at your age.</b>

624
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:18,910
<b>Don't think you're running out of time.</b>

625
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:21,310
<b>The man that's meant to be will turn up.</b>

626
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:29,280
<b>I thought it was my bad luck that kept me from marriage,</b>

627
00:42:31,350 --> 00:42:33,250
<b>but you're having it tough because of me too.</b>

628
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:37,290
<b>You can't enjoy having a son-in-law and grandchildren.</b>

629
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:42,030
<b>What can't I enjoy? That's not all that great.</b>

630
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:43,100
<b>I enjoy myself just fine.</b>

631
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:46,200
<b>And...</b>

632
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,540
<b>don't look in strange places.</b>

633
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:51,970
<b>Look close by.</b>

634
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:53,370
<b>Don't you know?</b>

635
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:56,710
<b>The bluebird is in the small room in your house.</b>

636
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:00,180
<b>Why is that there?</b>

637
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:26,140
<b>(Han I Sang)</b>

638
00:43:26,410 --> 00:43:27,610
<b>Why did you go to Gangnam?</b>

639
00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:28,840
<b>I said I'd come here.</b>

640
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:32,080
<b>I went to watch a dance for a bit.</b>

641
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,610
<b>- A dance? - Yes.</b>

642
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:48,330
<b>Jang Ha Ri.</b>

643
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:04,310
<b>Here's the dancer.</b>

644
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:07,410
<b>Dancer? Where?</b>

645
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:09,680
<b>- Where? - Never mind.</b>

646
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,790
<b>- Hello. It's nice to meet you. - Hello.</b>

647
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:16,620
<b>It's dinner time. Why don't we go eat?</b>

648
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:17,760
<b>I ordered already.</b>

649
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:19,190
<b>What would you like?</b>

650
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:24,730
<b>Iced Americano.</b>

651
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:26,470
<b>- Pardon? - Just a minute.</b>

652
00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:29,370
<b>Shall we go?</b>

653
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:33,440
<b>I want to have some more coffee. Their coffee is good.</b>

654
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:42,220
<b>Hot Americano.</b>

655
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:46,750
<b>- Yes. - Mine is iced.</b>

656
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:50,690
<b>Jae Young told you about me, right?</b>

657
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:54,760
<b>He said you were married briefly.</b>

658
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:57,330
<b>You must've been hesitant about meeting a divorcee.</b>

659
00:44:57,330 --> 00:45:01,400
<b>Not at all. I get so much judgment for not being married.</b>

660
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,970
<b>There are times when I think being divorced is better.</b>

661
00:45:04,310 --> 00:45:05,640
<b>I got married when I was 40 too.</b>

662
00:45:09,310 --> 00:45:11,980
<b>You never imagined you'd still be single at this age, right?</b>

663
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:15,350
<b>No.</b>

664
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:20,190
<b>It gets harder to meet people the older you get.</b>

665
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,890
<b>To be honest, there's a lot of pressure.</b>

666
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,530
<b>I realized from being married,</b>

667
00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:27,900
<b>that the couple's families must adjust as well as the couple.</b>

668
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:30,300
<b>It isn't easy.</b>

669
00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:36,200
<b>Dating and marriage...</b>

670
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,240
<b>are all so hard.</b>

671
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:44,310
<b>Even if...</b>

672
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:49,220
<b>it takes a while,</b>

673
00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:53,120
<b>why don't we get closer slowly?</b>

674
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:02,260
<b>If you say a while and slowly... How long?</b>

675
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:05,400
<b>It'll be hard to have kids if I wait too long.</b>

676
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:06,570
<b>Kids...</b>

677
00:46:07,870 --> 00:46:12,370
<b>You can have kids when you're 60 if you have the money.</b>

678
00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:14,270
<b>Even Trump had a son when he was 60.</b>

679
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,250
<b>A woman can't have kids in their 60s.</b>

680
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:25,290
<b>So, saying I have 10 years until menopause,</b>

681
00:46:25,390 --> 00:46:27,790
<b>12 times a year for 10 years is 120.</b>

682
00:46:27,790 --> 00:46:30,390
<b>I only have 120 chances at getting pregnant.</b>

683
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:32,190
<b>How many of those do you think will make it...</b>

684
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,530
<b>when I couldn't do it for 10 years? I don't have a guy.</b>

685
00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:37,430
<b>I don't know when I'll get married.</b>

686
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:40,400
<b>And that's only when you have many eggs...</b>

687
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:57,220
<b>So my point is...</b>

688
00:46:58,650 --> 00:46:59,720
<b>I envy men.</b>

689
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:17,440
<b>What's wrong, Do Ah?</b>

690
00:47:21,410 --> 00:47:24,080
<b>Oh no. Did you wake up?</b>

691
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:25,850
<b>It's okay.</b>

692
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:28,620
<b>(Galaxy Cafe on the Hills of Montmartre)</b>

693
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:50,100
<b>Let's get yummies for our Do Ah.</b>

694
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:51,470
<b>Yummies.</b>

695
00:47:52,010 --> 00:47:53,470
<b>Well...</b>

696
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:59,110
<b>Yummies for Do Ah's daddy.</b>

697
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:00,750
<b>For Do Ah's daddy.</b>

698
00:48:06,190 --> 00:48:07,250
<b>Let's go.</b>

699
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:09,690
<b>Do you live nearby?</b>

700
00:48:09,890 --> 00:48:11,060
<b>I live here.</b>

701
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:15,360
<b>I didn't think that guy would share an umbrella with you,</b>

702
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:17,160
<b>so I ran out and bought one.</b>

703
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:19,030
<b>Let's share.</b>

704
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:20,730
<b>Is this amusing to you?</b>

705
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:23,840
<b>You watched on purpose.</b>

706
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,210
<b>Don't be mad.</b>

707
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,150
<b>Don't you know how you apologize?</b>

708
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:40,150
<b>Why do you always show up during my most humiliating moments?</b>

709
00:48:40,590 --> 00:48:42,620
<b>You're so... Every time...</b>

710
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:44,530
<b>Don't follow me!</b>

711

<b>But... I didn't think much of it...</b>

712
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:50,660
<b>and watched.</b>

713
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:53,770
<b>I didn't mean to humiliate you. I'm sorry.</b>

714
00:48:54,470 --> 00:48:57,040
<b>Ha Ri. Wait. Ha Ri.</b>

715
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:58,510
<b>Ha Ri.</b>

716
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,480
<b>What...</b>

717
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:03,940
<b>Why did that...</b>

718
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:05,350
<b>My suit...</b>

00:49:05,910 --> 00:49:07,010
<b>Oh no.</b>

<b>What is it?</b>

<b>- Ha Ri, are you okay? - My suit...</b>

725

<b>What do you think you're doing?</b>

726

<b>- Let go of me! - What's wrong with you?</b>

<b>- Where did you come from? - Who are you?</b>

<b>Are you a mugger? A pervert?</b>

<b>What do you do for a living?</b>

730

<b>How do I look like a pervert or mugger to you?</b>

731
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:41,250
<b>You're more suspicious because you look normal!</b>

732

<b>And you shouldn't fall for it just because a guy talks to you.</b>

<b>What... What are you babbling about?</b>

734
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:49,690
<b>Let go!</b>

<b>- What? - You punk.</b>

737
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:08,950
<b>This is so embarrassing!</b>

738
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:16,720
<b>Stop it.</b>

739
00:50:17,490 --> 00:50:19,360
<b>What?</b>

740
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:40,640
<b>Let go.</b>

00:50:42,450 --> 00:50:43,550
<b>Darn it.</b>

742
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:51,860
<b>Oh no!</b>

<b>- Hey! Let go. - Wait.</b>

746

<b>Stop it!</b>

00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,270
<b>Let go!</b>

<b>Anyway. Sorry about that.</b>

<b>He isn't my colleague.</b>

755

<b>Ha Ri and I are like siblings.</b>

<b>And I thought she was in danger.</b>

757
00:51:39,970 --> 00:51:41,000
<b>You punk.</b>

758
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:43,840
<b>You should get along with your colleague.</b>

759
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,380
<b>Why would you have a fight in the middle of the street?</b>

760
00:51:45,410 --> 00:51:46,940
<b>- We're not colleagues. - We're not colleagues.</b>

761
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:52,850
<b>What about your blind date?</b>

762
00:51:52,850 --> 00:51:54,990
<b>What were you doing outside...</b>

763

<b>with your jacket all ripped apart?</b>

764

<b>Did you get rejected again?</b>

765
00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:03,130
<b>I didn't get rejected.</b>

766
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:06,130
<b>Do you think I get rejected all the time?</b>

767
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,460
<b>What's your problem?</b>

768
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,470
<b>Watch how you talk to me.</b>

769
00:52:09,830 --> 00:52:11,300
<b>You're so mean.</b>

770
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:13,670
<b>You should do something about your nasty temper.</b>

771
00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:16,070
<b>I was there.</b>

772

<b>I mean, she didn't exactly get rejected by him.</b>

774
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,620
<b>Anyway, they weren't meant for each other.</b>
