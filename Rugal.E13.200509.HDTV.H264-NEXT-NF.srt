1
00:00:00,054 --> 00:00:06,797
RUGAL

2
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:50,470
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGION AND INCIDENTS

3
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,810
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

4
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:05,610
Where is she?

5
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:07,490
Tell me the truth. Where is Yeo-jin?

6
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:12,660
You can't, right?

7
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:14,450
Because you faked it all.

8
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,330
Is that what you wish to believe?

9
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,210
Then tell me that I'm wrong, you bastard!

10
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,710
Where's Yeo-jin?

11
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:26,550
All that you have believed in
will start to crumble.

12
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,800
Even you

13
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:32,720
can turn into someone like me now.

14
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,690
Tell me where she is,

15
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:41,690
or I'll rip you apart.

16
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,400
This isn't the best place to talk, is it?

17
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:50,780
Why don't we go find an open space
that is nice and sunny?

18
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,080
You psycho...

19
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,870
I will tell you where Kim Yeo-jin is.

20
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:59,920
But you'll have to get me out
if you want to know where she is.

21
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:03,250
You have until tomorrow morning.
Do not get help from anybody.

22
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:05,710
You'll do it, right?

23
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,050
Then how can I know that she will be okay
until then?

24
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,800
I told you,
I checked with my own two eyes.

25
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:19,180
On my way here, I felt so bad
leaving your wife all alone there.

26
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:29,820
You're a valuable asset to us.
We should've treated you with respect.

27
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:32,950
Hey.

28
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,580
-Take good care of her.
-Yes, sir.

29
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,300
Can we talk?

30
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,720
Specifically

31
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,100
about Kang Gi-beom.

32
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,770
It'll be fun.

33
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,520
Even all the backstories you didn't know.
You'll hear it all.

34
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:26,880
I told you that you'll go insane.

35
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,840
I wanted to be the one telling you
that Kim Yeo-jin is alive.

36
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,090
That's why I ran to this police station.

37
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:39,140
Do you know how excited I was
while waiting for you?

38
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:41,060
Tell me everything.

39
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,270
Where are you hiding Yeo-jin?

40
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,150
Do you still think we are different?

41
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,320
Just answer my question, you bastard!

42
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,610
Harder! Punch me harder!

43
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,590
Kill me

44
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,170
and save the world.

45
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,260
Except for your woman.

46
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,100
What? You can't do that?

47
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,600
Then give up on the world, Kang Gi-beom!

48
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,650
Get me out of here and go save your woman.

49
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:30,610
Is it that difficult?

50
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,820
What has the world even done for you?

51
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,660
Have you already forgotten everything
it put you through?

52
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,530
Open your eyes, Kang Gi-beom.

53
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,200
Face the truth!

54
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:05,600
It does seem suspicious,

55
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,100
but I found no evidence
to prove that she's alive.

56
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:10,020
I tried my best as well,

57
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:11,730
but found nothing at all.

58
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,440
Whether we find evidence or not,

59
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:16,150
the problem is that Hwang Deuk-gu
is destroying Gi-beom.

60
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:19,110
Continuing to chase the traps
that bastard set up

61
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,660
will only lead to more confusion.

62
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,410
Tae-woong,
is there anything else we can do?

63
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,540
How about we do some digging
on the dark web?

64
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,750
I heard those IP addresses
aren't traceable.

65
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,420
This is Bradley's idea.

66
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,250
Even on the dark web, money is exchanged
when people sell and buy stuff.

67
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,590
Tracing bank accounts?

68
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:36,010
Yes, I heard they use cryptocurrency.

69
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:37,010
What about it?

70
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:40,050
It means the cryptocurrency accounts
are 100 percent real,

71
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,600
because they need to receive money.

72
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,930
Analyzing and tracing
cryptocurrency exchange details

73
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,680
may lead us to some clues.

74
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:49,390
If we can raid them
and catch them red-handed...

75
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,980
Then we'll be able to find out
whether Yeo-jin is alive or not.

76
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,860
IF YOU NEED TO REPORT A CRIME, DIAL 112

77
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,960
<i>Please don't hurt Gi-beom.</i>

78
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:17,460
<i>I'm begging you. Please don't hurt him.</i>

79
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,890
FAIR, FRIENDLY POLICE SERVICE

80
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,980
Find that place.

81
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:33,310
<i>Please don't hurt Gi-beom.</i>

82
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,270
<i>I'm begging you.</i>

83
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:40,200
<i>Please don't hurt him.
Please. I'm begging you.</i>

84
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:43,280
<i>Please don't hurt him.</i>

85
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:45,660
<i>Please, I beg you.</i>

86
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:01,130
Are you all right?

87
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:16,020
Hwang Deuk-gu was right.

88
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:18,860
Yeo-jin is alive.

89
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:28,790
-Hey.
-Sir.

90
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:31,540
Song Mi-na came by this morning.

91
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,830
She couldn't even take one day off?

92
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,330
-What about Hwang Deuk-gu?
-Everything's okay,

93
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:41,630
but Mi-na asked me about Gi-beom's wife.

94
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:45,090
-She did?
-She said she read the case file again

95
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,550
and asked who the real culprit is.

96
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,890
Anything else?

97
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:48,970
<i>No, that's all she said.</i>

98
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,390
<i>You already know the rest.</i>

99
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,850
But I keep getting a weird feeling,

100
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,230
so I thought I should tell you about it.

101
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:56,940
Okay, keep me updated.

102
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:08,490
YUYEON POLICE STATION

103
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,190
Why did you want to see me?

104
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:45,700
What's up?

105
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,950
I clearly warned you

106
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:52,240
that you should just get lost
unless you're going to work for me.

107
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:54,450
As you can see, I'm still here.

108
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,670
Does that answer your question?

109
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,670
That bastard was nowhere to be seen,

110
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,840
but he's in a holding cell now.
You heard, right?

111
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,670
Yes.

112
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,840
Hwang Deuk-gu, that asshole...

113
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,010
He won't be able to make it
through the night.

114
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:16,600
-Seriously?
-You should do something too.

115
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,190
What do you want?

116
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:22,860
Clean up the mess you made.

117
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:25,900
What do you mean?

118
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,320
Choi Ye-won.

119
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,040
All right.

120
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,500
She's been getting on my nerves anyway
because she's trying to boss me around.

121
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,960
All right, then. Let me pour you one.

122
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:51,300
Cheers.

123
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:02,270
Shall I go out?
Or do you guys want to come in here?

124
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,820
Fine, I'll go.

125
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:24,960
-Let's get this over with.
-Son of a bitch!

126
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,680
Why do you think I'm sparing you?

127
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,180
Clean up the mess.

128
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,070
WOMEN'S CHANGING ROOM

129
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,170
Gosh, you scared me.

130
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:12,440
That's what Hwang Deuk-gu said?

131
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:16,110
Yes. Frankly, even I can't tell
what's real and what's fake.

132
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,910
That sly bastard.

133
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:21,660
Is Gi-beom okay? I'm worried about
how this is going to affect him mentally.

134
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,660
Can we proceed with the idea
that Bradley came up with?

135
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,330
Yes, give it a shot.
You'll have to protect Gi-beom though.

136
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:31,250
Yes, sir.
Please send Mi-na and Gwang-cheol.

137
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,590
<i>Okay.</i>

138
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:46,640
Even if they started out on the dark web,
they end up using regular networks

139
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,810
later on as the frequency
and file sizes increase

140
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,820
because of the speed.

141
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,030
Koreans can put up with everything

142
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:55,610
but slow Internet speeds.

143
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:59,740
So you're saying the regulars eventually
migrate to messengers or e-mail, right?

144
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:02,870
Yes. We just need to trace
the information from both sides.

145
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,950
Then catching these perverts
will be a piece of cake.

146
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:07,790
The blacklist is done.

147
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,750
Now, I'll send it off to our hunters.

148
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,380
One more. Send!

149
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,780
-Who is it?
-I'm here to pick up the empty plates.

150
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,290
Gosh, I put them outside.

151
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,500
Who are you?

152
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,810
Do you have some time now?

153
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:18,400
What is this about?

154
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:24,530
This way, please.

155
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,700
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

156
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:34,420
-Go bring him, please.
-Please wait inside.

157
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:51,390
I heard you turned yourself in.
Is it true?

158
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,610
I won't ask you to get me out,
so just leave.

159
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:56,360
Do you think I came here to hear that?

160
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:00,150
Are you afraid Choi Yong might kill you
while I'm locked up?

161
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,660
Why are you doing this?

162
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:07,740
You won't understand even if I tell you.

163
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,750
Are you running away from Choi Yong?

164
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:14,750
Or, from me?

165
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,970
The holding cell next to mine is empty.

166
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,270
Stick around if you're curious.

167
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:33,560
This is about Argos' fate.

168
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,400
I don't have time for jokes.

169
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,480
I understand that's everything to you,
but my situation is different.

170
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,030
What is it that you want?

171
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:44,780
I'm waiting

172
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:47,870
for the clueless fool

173
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,580
to finally open his eyes
and come back to my arms.

174
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:59,250
Whatever the reason is, it looks like
you'll be locked up here for a while.

175
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,880
You think so?

176
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:04,630
But you see,

177
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,350
life is an unpredictable beast.

178
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,400
I haven't heard from Mi-na
and Gwang-cheol.

179
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,900
-Tae-woong, can I--
-Gi-beom.

180
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,120
What? This is awkward.

181
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,250
You may go do your own thing now.

182
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,670
This is the last time
I'm letting you do this.

183
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:40,750
Okay.

184
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,550
Get going.

185
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:00,420
There's nothing.

186
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,170
I thought we'd find
some evidence at least.

187
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,260
Let's hand them over to the police
and get moving.

188
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:09,050
-Where's Gi-beom?
-He left.

189
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,850
Are we doing the right thing?

190
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:17,270
If my sister were alive,
I'd have gone to save her at all costs.

191
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:20,140
I'm not sure if this is the right thing,

192
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:23,060
but I know that this is the only way
we can help Gi-beom.

193
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:25,520
Shouldn't we also go
and talk to Hwang Deuk-gu?

194
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:28,190
No, absolutely not. Especially you two.

195
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:31,610
I will take sole responsibility
for all misconduct.

196
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,280
-Tae-woong.
-This is an order.

197
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,450
Then what do we do now?

198
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:38,200
I'll follow Gi-beom.

199
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:41,290
You two can prepare for the next move.

200
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:44,840
Let's go.

201
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:08,780
<i>I'm sorry, guys.</i>

202
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:13,950
<i>This is the only solution
I can think of now.</i>

203
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:29,130
Who's the one
going in the other direction?

204
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,670
It's Gi-beom.

205
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:34,760
Sir, what time are they transferring
Hwang Deuk-gu?

206
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,100
Get the vehicle's location.

207
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,440
-Put Gi-beom on.
-Yes, sir.

208
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,360
I can't connect to him now.

209
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:07,790
-Yes, sir.
-Kang Gi-beom is on his way there now.

210
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,840
Pardon?

211
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,260
I bet he's after Hwang Deuk-gu.

212
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,470
No way.

213
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:18,430
Make sure he doesn't get into a scuffle
with the police.

214
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,520
Yes, sir.

215
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:25,900
Hit the gas.

216
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:50,630
Bravo!

217
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,180
<i>I'll fix everything.</i>

218
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:09,270
<i>Everything that is about to happen
from this moment on.</i>

219
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:15,070
Pull over.

220
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:17,700
Stop!

221
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:34,630
You piece of...

222
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:37,880
Hey, what's your problem?

223
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:42,760
Shut off all the cameras.
We must pull out now.

224
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:45,640
Then we won't be able to monitor
what's going on.

225
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:47,730
This cannot get leaked.

226
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:49,850
Never.

227
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:52,690
But what about the cops
who are already at the scene?

228
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,110
I'll take care of that.

229
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:03,740
Just leave.

230
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,790
This is considered obstruction of justice.

231
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:12,750
I'll pay for it.

232
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:15,250
~Later, not now.

233
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:38,690
Where is Yeo-jin?

234
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:45,450
I turned myself in, expecting
to rot in jail for about 20 years.

235
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,040
Shall I go to jail or not?

236
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:06,060
You should have done things my way
if you wanted to get what you want.

237
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,350
Good job, Kang Gi-beom.

238
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:12,730
I did what you asked,
so tell me where she is.

239
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,020
Tell me, you bastard.

240
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:23,110
The smell of freedom!

241
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:25,660
Kang Gi-beom,

242
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:29,080
you're no longer the man you were now.

243
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,830
We'll take our time

244
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,670
now that we're in the same boat.

245
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,550
The van was nauseating.

246
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:43,260
Hwang Deuk-gu.

247
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,550
Hwang Deuk-gu!

248
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:51,020
Would I leave you behind
when I'm just getting started?

249
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,270
Tail us.

250
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:06,030
58B5986

251
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:19,880
I have no choice
but to only move forward with this.

252
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:56,540
They never appreciate
what easily falls in their laps.

253
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,410
Anyway, you'll be thanking me soon.

254
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:13,390
You'll risk your lives to hold me off
for just a few minutes?

255
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,850
Let's get this over with.

256
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:48,250
You have no right
blocking the roads like this.

257
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,810
You're done going rogue.

258
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,730
Starting now, you'll follow my orders.

259
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,110
Get him.

260
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,400
Got it.

261
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,110
Hello.

262
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:56,540
The boys found this

263
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,540
at the scene.

264
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:17,970
All right.

265
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,310
Now, how about that reunion?

266
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:28,230
58B5986

267
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,870
BUILDING 3

268
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:53,070
Yeo-jin!

269
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,110
Gi-beom?

270
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:00,700
Gi-beom...

271
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:31,250
Are you hurt or injured in any way?

272
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:32,790
No.

273
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,590
You've lost so much weight.

274
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:40,880
I look nothing like myself, do I?

275
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,010
No, you're the same.

276
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,890
You haven't changed at all.

277
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:47,560
Let's take this off though.

278
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:55,570
Gi-beom, I--

279
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:56,980
You don't need to say anything.

280
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:59,400
I know I took too long.

281
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:01,780
It'll be all right now.

282
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:14,000
RESTRICTED NUMBER

283
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,380
Sorry to kill the mood,

284
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:20,720
but you should back up a little.

285
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,970
Our deal is over.

286
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:24,970
Oh, dear.

287
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,350
Says who?

288
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:37,270
What the hell do you want?

289
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,820
Back off if you want to save her.

290
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:20,030
I'm up against a man
who can dodge bullets,

291
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:21,990
so of course I came prepared.

292
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:26,280
I wonder if that can be said
for your wife as well.

293
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:29,200
Why are you suddenly doing this?

294
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,620
Nothing I do is random or unplanned.

295
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:33,790
From the moment
I turned myself in to the cops,

296
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:35,870
I have been waiting for this moment.

297
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:38,170
-You son of a--
-<i>That's enough.</i>

298
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:39,670
Stop right there.

299
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:42,090
<i>Step any closer</i>

300
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:45,680
and bullets will fly into
her pretty little face.

301
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:54,980
Get out here.

302
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,150
Talk to me face to face.

303
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:59,360
You won't get your way here.

304
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,240
There's nowhere to run
and no one's here to help you.

305
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:19,000
Mi-na, there's another one
in the adjacent building.

306
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:25,920
Why don't we start
with Kang Gi-beom's right leg?

307
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:07,300
<i>How about I tell your husband
how you've been living your life?</i>

308
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,850
-What's wrong?
-No.

309
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:13,970
What?

310
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:16,390
<i>You knew everything.</i>

311
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:19,440
When Kang Gi-beom
was being accused of murder,

312
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,400
you kept quiet and said nothing.

313
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,230
No...

314
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:24,900
What's wrong?

315
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:27,610
<i>I wonder how he'll react</i>

316
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:30,660
<i>when he finds out.</i>

317
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:33,490
Never.

318
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:37,160
I can't let you lose everything
all over again.

319
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:40,670
What are you talking about?

320
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,000
<i>To prevent all of that,</i>

321
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:47,550
there's only one thing you can do.

322
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:20,040
I'm sorry, Gi-beom.

323
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,290
Yeo-jin, please calm down.

324
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,210
If only we hadn't met again.

325
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:29,590
If only...

326
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,300
I had not survived the attack.

327
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:36,050
How could you even say that?

328
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,350
Do you have any idea
how glad I am that you're alive?

329
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:43,190
I don't need anything anymore,

330
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:45,230
so just come with me.

331
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:07,250
<i>I'm sorry, Gi-beom.</i>

332
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,050
<i>I love you.</i>

333
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:21,540
Yeo-jin.

334
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:25,080
Yeo-jin...

335
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:26,790
Yeo-jin.

336
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:29,500
Yeo-jin.

337
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:31,710
Yeo-jin...

338
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:22,170
Hold on.

339
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,380
Were you waiting for me?

340
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:26,470
How are you here?

341
00:43:26,970 --> 00:43:29,180
I opened my eyes to find myself uncuffed.

342
00:43:29,850 --> 00:43:32,730
It seemed like I got lucky,
so I came home.

343
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:34,190
Who got you out of jail?

344
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:36,770
Someone must have helped you.

345
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,940
The one who came back into my arms

346
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:42,780
opened the door of the police van

347
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:44,280
and uncuffed me.

348
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:45,360
Well, get back in there.

349
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,910
It can be a holding cell
or actual prison for all I care.

350
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,370
That's kind of mean of you.

351
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:53,960
Escaping police custody in broad daylight?

352
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,880
Because of you, Argos and I...

353
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,130
Don't you realize how bad this is for us?

354
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:07,050
The Choi Ye-won I know
is a skilled negotiator. Are you not?

355
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:09,260
Then at least give me the name
of your accomplice.

356
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:12,560
Wait a second. What was his name?

357
00:44:13,770 --> 00:44:15,140
Kang...

358
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:17,730
Kang?

359
00:44:19,810 --> 00:44:21,110
Kang Gi-beom...

360
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,570
Kang Gi-beom?

361
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:29,910
Anyway, don't wake me up for anything.
I want to have a good sleep tonight.

362
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,750
How dare you drag us into this

363
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:42,460
when all you care about is your pride?

364
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:45,300
What do you think you're doing,

365
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:46,970
Ye-won?

366
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:57,520
I'm done letting you
do whatever you please.

367
00:45:12,350 --> 00:45:13,480
Isn't she...

368
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:18,320
She's Kim Yeo-jin.

369
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:27,730
She's dead.

370
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:32,360
Please take care of her
so that Gi-beom won't be shocked

371
00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:34,650
when he sees her.

372
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,370
Okay.

373
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:42,330
Bradley, something's seriously wrong
with Gi-beom's eyes as well.

374
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:47,210
The oil in his eyes burst.

375
00:45:47,290 --> 00:45:49,040
It's nothing serious, right?

376
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:51,420
Stress usually increases pressure
in the eyes.

377
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:53,260
But for the oil to seep out like this...

378
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:55,630
I truly hope
it didn't flow into his brain.

379
00:45:56,970 --> 00:45:58,390
Fix him at all costs.

380
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:04,680
I will.

381
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:11,610
What were you guys doing

382
00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:13,190
when Gi-beom was chasing the vehicle?

383
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:15,610
We were focused on our task,
so we weren't aware of it.

384
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:17,030
What?

385
00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:21,030
So what about Kim Yeo-jin?

386
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:22,540
Did you find her or not?

387
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:25,620
Sir.

388
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:29,960
Shouldn't you be asking whether
she was alive to begin with?

389
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,050
Sir.

390
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:37,760
I allowed him

391
00:46:38,890 --> 00:46:40,430
to go, sir.

392
00:46:41,470 --> 00:46:44,020
-Why?
-I believed he could control himself.

393
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:45,430
And he did.

394
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:48,730
How could you say that
when he's lying over there?

395
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:53,020
Sir, is there something we don't know

396
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:56,530
regarding Kim Yeo-jin?

397
00:46:57,610 --> 00:47:00,320
Sir, we're perplexed here.

398
00:47:00,410 --> 00:47:03,740
Please tell us everything, sir.

399
00:47:09,790 --> 00:47:13,920
I'm certain Argos will target
Gi-beom next.

400
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:16,590
Then we should protect him.

401
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:18,930
It'll only be a matter of time

402
00:47:19,630 --> 00:47:21,140
until they get to him.

403
00:47:21,970 --> 00:47:23,260
We should still buy some time--

404
00:47:23,350 --> 00:47:24,850
His colleagues died.

405
00:47:25,350 --> 00:47:26,890
He searched far and near.

406
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,560
In addition, he assaulted Ko Yong-deok.

407
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:33,730
Argos will never give up.

408
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:36,070
They will kill him, his family,

409
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:38,690
and his friends.

410
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:46,120
Are you going to just sit and watch?

411
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:48,790
Do you want to save him?

412
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:50,920
Yes.

413
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:57,460
Ms. Kim.

414
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:00,720
Detective Yang, what brings you here
at this hour?

415
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:03,220
Is Gi-beom home?

416
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:04,680
He's on his way.

417
00:48:04,970 --> 00:48:07,470
This is great. I bought extra.

418
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:09,980
Come inside. Let's have dinner together.

419
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:12,440
Okay.

420
00:48:21,570 --> 00:48:23,160
We need to kill them first.

421
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:25,280
Sorry?

422
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:29,910
Argos will be baffled to see them dead.

423
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:32,500
We'll attack them and leave no one alive.

424
00:48:33,790 --> 00:48:35,460
We can't spare anyone.

425
00:48:55,270 --> 00:48:57,150
Does that mean

426
00:48:57,230 --> 00:48:58,480
we can save

427
00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:00,860
both Gi-beom and his wife?

428
00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:04,700
This is the only way to save them.

429
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:09,450
This will place her
in suspended animation.

430
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:12,330
If you take too long,

431
00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:14,000
she will die.

432
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:17,080
You need to be thorough and quick.

433
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:20,300
If you so much as hesitate,

434
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,590
this plan will fall through.

435
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:26,430
Yes, sir.

436
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:29,310
What are you planning to do afterward?

437
00:49:29,970 --> 00:49:31,140
I trust you,

438
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:33,230
but what if they suspect me
as the criminal?

439
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:37,730
-Perhaps, it's best to tell Gi-beom--
-No.

440
00:49:48,370 --> 00:49:50,280
NAME: LEE EUN-JEONG
AGE: 32

441
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,350
What happened?

442
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:21,610
What happened to me?

443
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:25,070
What about my husband?

444
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:29,370
It's a long story.

445
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:33,580
But this was the only way
to save both of you.

446
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:47,380
What does he mean?

447
00:50:47,470 --> 00:50:49,760
INCUMBENT POLICE OFFICER KANG GI-BEOM
MURDERER WHO KILLED HIS WIFE

448
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,390
Gi-beom is a murderer?

449
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:54,600
He didn't stab me--

450
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:55,600
I know.

451
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:58,350
You must be baffled.

452
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:02,400
But you must accept things
as they are for now.

453
00:51:04,030 --> 00:51:05,320
I need to see him.

454
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:07,570
Please bring him here.

455
00:51:07,650 --> 00:51:08,780
Not right now.

456
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:10,610
It'll only exacerbate the situation.

457
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:12,740
He won't have me by his side!

458
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:14,540
That's even worse!

459
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:22,040
Let me go! Let go!

460
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:23,840
Let go! I said, let go!

461
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,170
I will save him!

462
00:51:27,590 --> 00:51:28,670
I give you my word.

463
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:31,390
After some time,

464
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:34,760
you will understand everything.

465
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:37,680
Gi-beom...

466
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:55,120
I heard Kang Gi-beom died while trying
to break out of prison.

467
00:51:56,910 --> 00:51:58,160
If he was in his right mind,

468
00:51:58,250 --> 00:52:01,040
he wouldn't have killed his wife
or gouged out his eyes.

469
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:02,920
I'm glad he died.

470
00:52:03,130 --> 00:52:04,710
He probably wouldn't have made it.

471
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:07,510
It gives me chills
that he was a police officer.

472
00:52:07,590 --> 00:52:08,960
I know.

473
00:52:09,510 --> 00:52:11,970
They need to take strict measures
when hiring police officers.

474
00:52:12,050 --> 00:52:13,220
The mentally ill should be exempted.

475
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:05,650
<i>Choi Geun-cheol.</i>

476
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:09,020
"Choi Geun-cheol"?

477
00:53:10,070 --> 00:53:13,200
It's about time you stepped down
from the stage he fabricated.

478
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,860
Cut the nonsense.

479
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:19,330
Do you still think
I'm the one who killed your wife?

480
00:53:19,410 --> 00:53:20,830
Who else could it be?

481
00:53:20,910 --> 00:53:23,040
I told you. It was all fabricated.

482
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:25,250
He fabricated her death,
acted like he cared for you,

483
00:53:25,330 --> 00:53:26,250
<i>and pretended to be a victim.</i>

484
00:53:26,830 --> 00:53:28,420
Don't you get it? He did it.

485
00:53:29,130 --> 00:53:31,670
<i>I'm Chief Choi Geun-cheol
from the National Police Agency.</i>

486
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:35,130
<i>I was the one who decided
not to prove your innocence.</i>

487
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:38,430
<i>Argos will continue to track you down
until the end.</i>

488
00:53:39,430 --> 00:53:40,470
<i>Here's a gift.</i>

489
00:53:41,430 --> 00:53:43,600
<i>You're free now.</i>

490
00:53:44,770 --> 00:53:46,850
<i>Why did you ruin my life
without my consent?</i>

491
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:50,730
I wanted to give you a new pair of eyes
in exchange for working for me.

492
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:52,530
<i>Simply put, you'll become a human weapon.</i>

493
00:53:52,610 --> 00:53:54,780
<i>I have full control over you.</i>

494
00:53:55,070 --> 00:53:57,280
<i>That includes all the information you have
as well as your thoughts.</i>

495
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:59,740
<i>This imbalance is the root
of all that's unjust.</i>

496
00:53:59,830 --> 00:54:01,450
<i>If it reaps fruit,</i>

497
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:03,580
a balance is soon to follow.

498
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:06,040
<i>Let's put this high-tech individual
to good use.</i>

499
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:09,540
<i>Trust the information provided
by your eyes and your own judgment.</i>

500
00:54:09,630 --> 00:54:12,090
Sir, you were the one
who was concerned about the dangers

501
00:54:12,170 --> 00:54:13,090
Gi-beom's eyes could pose.

502
00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:14,550
Let's find out

503
00:54:15,010 --> 00:54:16,340
how dangerous they are.

504
00:54:16,430 --> 00:54:18,930
This is your opportunity
to bring me good results.

505
00:54:19,010 --> 00:54:22,260
Argos. Is there another reason
other than that?

506
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:27,390
You've been listening to me well
up until now.

507
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:29,770
<i>So why are you suddenly doubting me?</i>

508
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:31,650
You're a crazy bastard.

509
00:54:31,730 --> 00:54:34,110
I shouldn't have told you that information
so easily.

510
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:38,280
I'll give you back what's yours.

511
00:54:39,070 --> 00:54:41,280
Take your time and give it some thought.

512
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:50,880
Gi-beom, what did he say about Chief Choi?

513
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,750
It's nothing. Let's go.

514
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:01,600
<i>No.</i>

515
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:05,770
<i>Never.</i>

516
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:09,310
<i>I can't let you lose everything
all over again.</i>

517
00:55:11,770 --> 00:55:13,480
I'm sorry, Gi-beom.

518
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:20,950
<i>If only we hadn't met again.</i>

519
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:23,160
<i>If only...</i>

520
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:27,250
<i>I had not survived the attack.</i>

521
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:32,210
<i>I love you.</i>

522
00:55:51,190 --> 00:55:52,810
You still need to rest.

523
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:53,770
Where's Yeo-jin?

524
00:55:56,860 --> 00:55:58,070
Where is she?

525
00:55:58,150 --> 00:56:00,530
Gi-beom, you should rest a bit more.

526
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:05,580
Gi-beom.

527
00:56:14,130 --> 00:56:17,210
Gi-beom, you can see her later.

528
00:57:35,170 --> 00:57:36,130
That's how

529
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:37,960
she vanished.

530
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:40,550
I had concealed her identity,
and it backfired on me.

531
00:57:41,590 --> 00:57:42,970
I wasn't able to track her.

532
00:57:43,050 --> 00:57:44,800
You killed her to save her.

533
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:47,390
But she ran away from you?

534
00:57:47,470 --> 00:57:48,930
There was nothing you could do?

535
00:57:49,010 --> 00:57:50,680
That means Gi-beom knew nothing

536
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:52,720
when he was falsely charged
and went to prison.

537
00:57:55,690 --> 00:57:57,520
Are you sure

538
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:01,480
that you did all of that for me?

539
00:58:02,070 --> 00:58:05,070
Of course. When I had helped you
escape from prison,

540
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:07,410
she had been under my protection.

541
00:58:07,490 --> 00:58:10,410
Then why did you never tell me
that she was alive?

542
00:58:11,330 --> 00:58:13,080
If everything went as planned,

543
00:58:13,830 --> 00:58:15,410
we wouldn't be having this conversation.

544
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:18,040
I had no idea
whether she was alive or dead

545
00:58:18,710 --> 00:58:21,500
or what she had to go through.

546
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:24,800
And yet, I was calling myself a hero
and obeying your orders.

547
00:58:26,630 --> 00:58:28,510
Why didn't you tell me?

548
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:33,270
Despite having
my own family member to save,

549
00:58:34,390 --> 00:58:36,560
I was fighting for Rugal
and saving people.

550
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:38,150
The past doesn't matter.

551
00:58:39,730 --> 00:58:40,900
You're a part of Rugal now.

552
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:42,860
Don't forget your duties.

553
00:58:45,030 --> 00:58:46,700
Don't tell me

554
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:50,660
that you were the one
who gouged out my eyes.

555
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:52,830
What are you blabbering about?

556
00:58:52,910 --> 00:58:55,120
Did you stab her and gouge out my eyes

557
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:57,960
so that I'd join your team?

558
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,290
Answer me!

559
00:59:06,050 --> 00:59:07,010
Put your gun down.

560
00:59:07,090 --> 00:59:09,090
Put it down. This isn't right.

561
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:11,640
What kind of human does that?

562
00:59:15,310 --> 00:59:16,430
Why did you do this to me?

563
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:18,770
This is an order. Put it down!

564
00:59:18,850 --> 00:59:20,690
Why did you do that to her?

565
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:24,400
That's enough.

566
00:59:27,740 --> 00:59:30,240
-Move aside.
-You can blame him for his mistakes.

567
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:32,780
But you can't blame him
for not being perfect.

568
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:34,700
He did the best he could.

569
00:59:34,790 --> 00:59:36,450
Do not look down on his sincerity.

570
00:59:48,130 --> 00:59:49,590
I don't understand

571
00:59:50,380 --> 00:59:51,680
that "sincerity" either.

572
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:54,810
White lies

573
00:59:55,350 --> 00:59:56,600
can't be considered a sincerity.

574
00:59:59,810 --> 01:00:01,940
The one I need to take my revenge on

575
01:00:03,310 --> 01:00:04,190
is you,

576
01:00:05,570 --> 01:00:06,400
Choi Geun-cheol.

577
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:35,680
Subtitle translation by Soo-ji Kim

01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:55,780
<i>I'm done caring for anything anymore
and that includes Rugal.</i>

579
01:00:55,870 --> 01:00:57,450
<i>Let's go back together.</i>

580
01:00:57,530 --> 01:01:00,450
Nothing you say now
will change our situation.

581
01:01:01,290 --> 01:01:03,040
Is he really going to kill them all?

582
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:06,420
Kang Gi-beom is obedient to me these days.
Do you know why?

583
01:01:07,290 --> 01:01:09,170
<i>It's because he's discovered the truth.</i>

584
01:01:09,250 --> 01:01:10,550
<i>Find Choi Geun-cheol.</i>

585
01:01:11,130 --> 01:01:13,300
We'll also end up used and abandoned too.

586
01:01:13,970 --> 01:01:16,430
<i>But I cannot allow insubordination.</i>

587
01:01:17,050 --> 01:01:18,100
<i>Come back to us.</i>

588
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:20,520
<i>I won't let you have your way.</i>
