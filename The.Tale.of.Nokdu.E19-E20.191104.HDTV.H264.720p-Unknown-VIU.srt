00:00:04,883 --> 00:00:06,913
(All characters, organizations, places, cases, and incidents...)

2
00:00:06,913 --> 00:00:08,997
(in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:10,623 --> 00:00:13,718
(Episode 19)

4
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,964
Well, you are not my family.

5
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:31,205
But you can pretend to be my family and come see me.

6
00:00:31,499 --> 00:00:33,404
I cannot do that to you...

7
00:00:34,929 --> 00:00:36,805
no matter how awful I am.

8
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,214
First place of military service exam.

9
00:00:42,869 --> 00:00:44,285
Yeon Soo.

10
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,084
Congratulations.

11
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:04,434
Do you think you will not pay...

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,444
for what you have done to me?

13
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,315
Will you not accept the certificate?

14
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,825
This is all because of you.

15
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,655
This is all because...

16
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,724
you are the son...

17
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:27,864
of His Majesty.

18
00:01:33,419 --> 00:01:35,634
Will you accept this certificate from me?

19
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,685
Are you all right?

20
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,354
I heard that you almost got hurt from the gambling house.

21
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:01,890
I am sorry. I feel like I am responsible for it.

22
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:04,465
No, you are not. I went there on my own will.

23
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,689
How about looking for a way to become a court lady?

24
00:02:08,689 --> 00:02:10,029
You are pretty.

25
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:12,599
Pardon? Court lady?

26
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,405
Well, why not?

27
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,969
When His Majesty comes out in disguise, approach him...

28
00:02:19,969 --> 00:02:21,309
and win him over.

29
00:02:21,309 --> 00:02:23,514
That way, you will be able to enter the palace right away.

30
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:26,110
He comes out in disguise?

31
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:28,279
Yes. He says he comes out in disguise,

32
00:02:28,279 --> 00:02:29,879
but everyone at the palace knows that.

33
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:32,025
He often goes out at night.

34
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,145
Please go in. He is waiting for you.

35
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,155
Are you not curious...

36
00:03:02,309 --> 00:03:03,785
what I told...

37
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,025
His Majesty in there?

38
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,465
Yeon Soo.

39
00:03:10,689 --> 00:03:12,264
Did you come here with the vice-curator?

40
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,305
With the girl and the drunkard too?

41
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,805
- You... - Take...

42
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:22,074
as much time as you want.

43
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,514
Were you that surprised?

44
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:32,585
Pardon?

45
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,254
I ask because you have been only staring at me...

46
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:38,095
since you came in and did not say a word to me.

47
00:03:40,279 --> 00:03:41,565
I am sorry.

48
00:03:42,149 --> 00:03:43,224
I mean,

49
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,134
my apologies for not knowing the rules of the palace.

50
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:52,305
I am not used to the rules here.

51
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,715
I get to laugh thanks to you.

52
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:00,615
There is no need for that.

53
00:04:00,839 --> 00:04:04,085
Rules are not necessary between you and me.

54
00:04:07,649 --> 00:04:08,724
Right.

55
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,794
Is that so?

56
00:04:29,529 --> 00:04:30,914
Of course.

57
00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:32,345
Under one condition.

58
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:35,645
You must pretend not to know about my night outing.

59
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,885
Please keep it a secret to your lady as well.

60
00:04:39,609 --> 00:04:40,814
What do you say?

61
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:44,624
I will comply.

62
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:51,120
I will assign you to Chief Administrative Officer Baek...

63
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,794
whom you have met the other day.

64
00:04:52,989 --> 00:04:55,465
You will help him with his tasks.

65
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,335
Yes, Your Majesty.

66
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:15,408
Open it.

67
00:05:15,409 --> 00:05:16,484
Here.

68
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:24,564
Here.

69
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,190
My gosh. This is no way to treat your guest.

70
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,265
Guest?

71
00:05:30,529 --> 00:05:32,859
I did not know guests brought swords.

72
00:05:32,859 --> 00:05:33,934
You know?

73
00:05:34,599 --> 00:05:35,974
I am a guest...

74
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,699
as long as you do not cause trouble.

75
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,838
What?

76
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:41,169
You are the one who barged into our house, making a fuss.

77
00:05:41,169 --> 00:05:43,445
Have you already forgotten?

78
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:18,940
Why are you fighting when I am having a meal here?

79
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,515
You will chase away my appetite.

80
00:06:21,049 --> 00:06:22,525
Goodness.

81
00:06:27,349 --> 00:06:29,520
She is right. Stop it.

82
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,465
You will spoil our happy reunion.

83
00:06:34,859 --> 00:06:36,028
You little brat.

84
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:38,174
Come over here. You brat.

85
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,445
I do not want to harm you.

86
00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:45,674
- Not yet, at least. - "Not yet"?

87
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,085
You are unbelievable.

88
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,025
It is because of me.

89
00:06:59,049 --> 00:07:01,349
He found me when I went to the palace gate to wait for you.

90
00:07:01,349 --> 00:07:04,494
No, it is all right. He would have probably tailed me anyway.

91
00:07:06,989 --> 00:07:08,064
Come with me.

92
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,244
So you are still alive, which is unfortunate.

93
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,585
Thanks to you.

94
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,909
By the way, why did you suddenly get a job at the palace?

95
00:07:28,909 --> 00:07:30,224
To be successful.

96
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,224
I need to make a living,

97
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,025
and as you know, I am very talented in martial arts.

98
00:07:35,849 --> 00:07:38,895
What about you? What are you getting at?

99
00:07:40,289 --> 00:07:42,705
I have never been stabbed by a sword before.

100
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,205
I thought I would die when I passed out.

101
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,474
When I gave it some thought after waking up,

102
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:50,804
I thought it would be a shame...

103
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,215
if I kill you with that simple method.

104
00:07:55,089 --> 00:07:56,395
This is between you and me.

105
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,589
Do not get others involved in this. If you do...

106
00:07:58,589 --> 00:07:59,664
Why not?

107
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,974
Will you tell His Majesty that I am planning treason?

108
00:08:03,899 --> 00:08:05,344
Do you think I cannot?

109
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:08,570
I will bring you and your great family down.

110
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:10,174
I doubt you can.

111
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:14,315
Your brother is planning the treason with me.

112
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:15,755
What?

113
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,984
Do not look at me that way.

114
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:22,594
He came back to me willingly.

115
00:08:23,219 --> 00:08:25,389
Unlike you,

116
00:08:25,389 --> 00:08:28,734
he is greedy and ambitious...

117
00:08:29,089 --> 00:08:30,089
just like me.

118
00:08:30,089 --> 00:08:31,404
You scumbag.

119
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,344
What are you doing?

120
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:45,384
Be careful. You will get hurt.

121
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:48,285
Are you okay? Are you injured?

122
00:09:00,049 --> 00:09:02,019
If you do not want him to die, follow me.

123
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:04,188
What is this lunatic saying?

124
00:09:04,189 --> 00:09:05,630
Is that a threat?

125
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:06,929
Think however you like,

126
00:09:06,929 --> 00:09:08,330
but I will not allow you to stay here.

127
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:09,360
Go.

128
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,035
Go inside your room.

129
00:09:25,409 --> 00:09:27,354
I will bring my belongings,

130
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:28,825
so wait.

131
00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:41,234
Are you...

132
00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:43,905
very upset with her?

133
00:09:47,029 --> 00:09:48,114
No.

134
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,285
I have given up on her.

135
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:52,669
Sorry?

136
00:09:52,669 --> 00:09:56,114
I had been letting her do whatever she wanted...

137
00:09:56,809 --> 00:09:58,555
because I realized...

138
00:09:59,149 --> 00:10:02,094
that she was hanging on with the strength that she had.

139
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,925
But then, a guy appeared,

140
00:10:05,649 --> 00:10:08,335
and she is swayed by him.

141
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:11,405
I cannot take it anymore and have decided to give up...

142
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:13,705
winning her heart.

143
00:10:15,029 --> 00:10:16,305
Then why did you tell her to come?

144
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:18,805
I will have her.

145
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,445
Even if she does not like me,

146
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:24,514
I will keep her beside me forever.

147
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:29,415
I will fulfill a wish of hers,

148
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,185
so I believe I have the right.

149
00:10:32,649 --> 00:10:35,025
Then why have you spared him?

150
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:37,724
- He is dangerous. - You are correct.

151
00:10:38,189 --> 00:10:40,419
But seeing how he and the King...

152
00:10:40,419 --> 00:10:42,634
could not recognize each other...

153
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:46,305
made it quite fascinating.

154
00:10:48,429 --> 00:10:50,974
The King who kills his son twice.

155
00:10:53,429 --> 00:10:55,844
That will be enough to justify our revolt.

156
00:10:58,210 --> 00:10:59,945
He will die...

157
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:01,854
in his father's hands.

158
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,055
There is no other way.

159
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:10,080
Are you going to kill him?

160
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:13,289
If you do, you will have to flee for killing a royal family member.

161
00:11:13,289 --> 00:11:15,360
Will you abandon Aeng Du and her father?

162
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,090
Or will you bring them along?

163
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:18,130
But why are you leaving?

164
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:20,230
Because that will keep everyone else safe.

165
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,874
And...

166
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:26,474
I do not care about him.

167
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:30,514
So do not fight him.

168
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:32,844
I do not want to see you get hurt.

169
00:11:44,049 --> 00:11:46,224
I am just temporarily moving out.

170
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,165
Goodbye. Do not see me out.

171
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,344
That is enough!

172
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,210
You want him to take his father's place?

173
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:09,309
I have no desire to make Nok Du do such a heinous deed.

174
00:12:09,309 --> 00:12:13,085
And you have no right to dethrone the King.

175
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:19,565
(Royal Command)

176
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:27,104
My lord.

177
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:41,655
Everyone is siding with him.

178
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:44,484
He will make his move soon.

179
00:12:45,049 --> 00:12:46,655
What will you do?

180
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,394
I will become...

181
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:54,394
a king who will exercise his absolute authority.

182
00:12:54,659 --> 00:12:56,960
He wiped out a village full of women...

183
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,864
as he pleased.

184
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,675
Lady Chun was on his side, but he killed her with no regrets.

185
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:07,305
Grand Prince Neungyang...

186
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:10,445
should never take the throne.

187
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:35,435
The guards will stop you. Let me accompany you.

188
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:37,275
Stay.

189
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,305
If anything happens to me,

190
00:13:42,569 --> 00:13:45,214
please do what I have said to you.

191
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:49,484
Yes, my lord.

192
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:52,384
Please be safe.

193
00:14:04,419 --> 00:14:05,935
You may not leave.

194
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:07,230
This is a royal command.

195
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:08,435
Move aside.

196
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,604
I must speak with His Majesty.

197
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:11,945
Please stop.

198
00:14:12,429 --> 00:14:14,000
I will relay your message.

199
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,175
Move aside!

200
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,915
I have served the King twice as long as you did.

201
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:22,685
I am doing this to protect him.

202
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,685
So move aside.

203
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:32,494
Please wait while I bring out the palanquin.

204
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:45,405
Eat.

205
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,585
On that day when the village for widows was attacked,

206
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:55,114
did you rescue me, right?

207
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:58,525
I did although you returned.

208
00:14:58,909 --> 00:15:00,825
How did you get through...

209
00:15:01,149 --> 00:15:02,994
all those thugs?

210
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,624
I have enough power to do that.

211
00:15:06,549 --> 00:15:09,159
Or perhaps, you had enough power to scheme such a thing.

212
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:11,065
I had no choice.

213
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:16,734
Is this who you truly are?

214
00:15:17,299 --> 00:15:19,945
Are you someone who threatens people by taking hostages...

215
00:15:20,569 --> 00:15:22,445
and kills innocent women?

216
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:26,185
So?

217
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:29,315
Were you disappointed?

218
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:32,450
You were never curious...

219
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:35,425
about who I was or what I did.

220
00:15:37,179 --> 00:15:38,919
That is not important.

221
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:40,364
It was for me.

222
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:42,795
It was the most important.

223
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:45,805
Then why are you treating me this way?

224
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:48,905
Because money could not win you over.

225
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:52,144
No matter how much I tried, you never accepted my feelings.

226
00:15:52,299 --> 00:15:54,370
I resorted to another way, so just stay put and...

227
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,445
I have told you clearly.

228
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,315
I left that house,

229
00:15:59,569 --> 00:16:02,585
but I have no plans to stay obedient under this roof.

230
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,835
So if that is what you want,

231
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:08,345
you may as well kill me.

232
00:16:09,729 --> 00:16:11,304
That is the quickest solution.

233
00:16:24,305 --> 00:16:29,305


234
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,375
I must meet with the Queen.

235
00:16:52,939 --> 00:16:54,985
I heard you were locked up.

236
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:57,684
What is going on?

237
00:16:58,449 --> 00:17:01,794
And what do you need to tell me so urgently?

238
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:05,494
You have kept that with you all along.

239
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,704
(20 years ago)

240
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:21,644
Please bury this alongside my son.

241
00:17:35,149 --> 00:17:36,224
Yes.

242
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,194
I asked you for that favor...

243
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:43,234
because I was going to keep this with me at all times.

244
00:17:44,389 --> 00:17:48,444
I lost him before I could even feed him.

245
00:17:50,629 --> 00:17:52,974
This gives me comfort.

246
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,414
Come to think of it,

247
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:01,954
I never got to ask you this.

248
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:05,095
Did he safely get buried?

249
00:18:05,849 --> 00:18:07,095
Your Majesty.

250
00:18:08,179 --> 00:18:09,565
I have something to tell...

251
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,045
What are you doing here, Chancellor?

252
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,240
He says he comes out in disguise,

253
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,940
but everyone at the palace knows that.

254
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,154
He often goes out at night.

255
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:38,625
He comes out in disguise?

256
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,325
I might be able to kill him without even entering the palace.

257
00:18:48,859 --> 00:18:50,504
Or I might die instead.

258
00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:56,098
Boss, are you okay?

259
00:18:56,099 --> 00:18:58,744
Do I look okay to you?

260
00:19:00,569 --> 00:19:03,285
I am going to catch those jerks...

261
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:05,355
and teach them a lesson.

262
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,855
- Darn it! - Gosh, walk slowly.

263
00:19:07,909 --> 00:19:09,684
Be gentle.

264
00:19:09,909 --> 00:19:11,585
Those darn jerks.

265
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:14,050
Hey, walk slowly.

266
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:15,295
Be gentle.

267
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:17,625
Those darn punks.

268
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,194
Are you here to see me?

269
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,865
No.

270
00:19:56,389 --> 00:19:58,204
I dropped by while I was passing by.

271
00:20:03,429 --> 00:20:05,914
I wish you good luck with your new job.

272
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,585
What about you?

273
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,585
- Are you okay? - Of course, I am okay.

274
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,510
I get to live in a huge house.

275
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:15,654
And as you can see, I am allowed to go wherever I want.

276
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:20,525
So do not worry and just focus on doing well.

277
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:26,365
What is it?

278
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,404
Do you also think I look very handsome?

279
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,434
I already know.

280
00:20:31,829 --> 00:20:33,875
You really have no sense of shame.

281
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:35,369
You do not look handsome,

282
00:20:35,369 --> 00:20:37,744
but you do look like a rookie who has just became an officer.

283
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,615
Go on inside.

284
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:47,585
I ordered you not to leave your house.

285
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:49,825
I apologize, Your Majesty.

286
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:53,795
But there is something I need to tell you.

287
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,464
I heard you told the guard...

288
00:20:56,849 --> 00:20:58,394
that you are trying to protect me.

289
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,265
Yes, that is correct.

290
00:21:00,619 --> 00:21:01,894
Tell me.

291
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,490
What are you trying to protect me from?

292
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:05,065
And how are you going to do that?

293
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:09,775
I am aware of a man who is getting ready to betray you.

294
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,375
Who is that?

295
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:18,615
It is Grand Prince Neungyang.

296
00:21:19,139 --> 00:21:21,339
He is doing so many evil things...

297
00:21:21,339 --> 00:21:23,879
to steal the throne from you.

298
00:21:23,879 --> 00:21:24,984
What did you say?

299
00:21:26,349 --> 00:21:27,349
Grand Prince Neungyang?

300
00:21:27,349 --> 00:21:29,589
You must arrest him and punish him right now.

301
00:21:29,589 --> 00:21:31,625
And as soon as you are done punishing him,

302
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,790
I also ask you to kill me...

303
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:35,805
for being disloyal.

304
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,015
You sounded so sincere...

305
00:21:52,409 --> 00:21:54,984
that I almost believed you.

306
00:22:19,569 --> 00:22:21,144
Repeat what you just said.

307
00:22:22,139 --> 00:22:25,085
What did you just say to me?

308
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:28,055
Your son who was born...

309
00:22:28,649 --> 00:22:30,055
20 years ago...

310
00:22:31,179 --> 00:22:34,355
is still alive, Your Majesty.

311
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:38,125
What? He is alive?

312
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:44,365
How did you find out?

313
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:50,144
I met that man by coincidence...

314
00:22:51,629 --> 00:22:53,515
and ended up hearing about some things...

315
00:22:54,369 --> 00:22:56,444
I should not have found out.

316
00:23:06,579 --> 00:23:07,855
He is...

317
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:11,365
the eldest son of Jung Yun Jeo...

318
00:23:12,389 --> 00:23:14,365
and a living witness.

319
00:23:16,659 --> 00:23:18,335
My so-called brother...

320
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,575
is your son, Your Majesty.

321
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,575
My father...

322
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,775
raised him as his son.

323
00:23:26,369 --> 00:23:29,569
How do you expect me to believe that?

324
00:23:29,569 --> 00:23:32,045
Please forgive us!

325
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:35,754
What?

326
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:39,095
There is another man who is aware of this.

327
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:41,694
Who is that?

328
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:45,025
It is Heo Yun,

329
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:47,765
the chancellor.

330
00:23:50,089 --> 00:23:52,329
He has been blackmailing me.

331
00:23:52,329 --> 00:23:54,605
He told me that he will frame me as a traitor...

332
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:57,974
if I did not keep my mouth shut.

333
00:23:59,369 --> 00:24:01,575
However, I could not do that.

334
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,045
I could not dare to deceive you, Your Majesty.

335
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:24,535
Your Majesty.

336
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:27,775
You must not get fooled by him.

337
00:24:31,329 --> 00:24:32,414
Then...

338
00:24:33,169 --> 00:24:35,015
who am I supposed to trust?

339
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:36,785
You?

340
00:24:37,369 --> 00:24:40,015
You were my closest friend and most loyal servant.

341
00:24:40,139 --> 00:24:42,325
But how can I trust you when you have been lying to me?

342
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:45,754
Do you know how much I wished that I would be wrong?

343
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,724
As I was constantly suspicious of you,

344
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:49,595
I still hoped that I would be wrong!

345
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:54,494
Do you have any idea how much I hoped that I was mistaken?

346
00:24:55,829 --> 00:24:58,904
Please kill me, Your Majesty.

347
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,569
But Your Majesty, you still cannot...

348
00:25:02,569 --> 00:25:05,944
trust the words of Grand Prince Neungyang.

349
00:25:07,069 --> 00:25:08,375
That is enough!

350
00:25:13,109 --> 00:25:14,315
I want you...

351
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:18,055
to quietly take him to the dungeon.

352
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:22,865
Your Majesty, you can punish me all you want!

353
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:26,635
But you must not trust Grand Prince Neungyang!

354
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,234
Your Majesty!

355
00:25:28,589 --> 00:25:30,305
Your Majesty!

356
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:33,135
You must not trust him!

357
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:35,234
Your Majesty!

358
00:25:35,899 --> 00:25:37,244
Your Majesty!

359
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:40,315
Do not let him fool you!

360
00:25:41,669 --> 00:25:42,885
Your Majesty!

361
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:44,785
Your Majesty!

362
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,924
I am Yeon Soo, the newly appointed chief administrative officer.

363
00:25:54,579 --> 00:25:55,589
I heard you came to the palace,

364
00:25:55,589 --> 00:25:57,295
- so I thought... - I already heard about you.

365
00:25:58,589 --> 00:26:01,265
His Majesty has given orders to urgently arrest someone.

366
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:02,565
Follow me.

367
00:26:03,159 --> 00:26:04,234
Okay.

368
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:07,500
The evidence is loud and clear.

369
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,775
What is the point of meeting him at this point?

370
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:11,530
The guards will be outside,

371
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:13,575
and it will be hard for you to even meet him.

372
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:15,770
But I should still give it a try.

373
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:17,684
I need to hear two sides of the story.

374
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:20,010
Then let us go together.

375
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:21,684
- Okay. - I prefer to go alone.

376
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:23,555
I will not be late.

377
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:27,224
That brat.

378
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:36,204
No one can find out about the man we are about to arrest.

379
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:39,474
So we need to make sure not to cause a scene.

380
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:56,579
- You must escape. - What is the matter?

381
00:26:56,579 --> 00:26:58,109
Arrest him right now!

382
00:26:58,109 --> 00:26:59,178
This is the royal command!

383
00:26:59,179 --> 00:27:00,919
Run toward the backdoor.

384
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:02,394
I will be right behind you.

385
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,035
You should go.

386
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:01,015
Where is my father?

387
00:28:04,609 --> 00:28:06,419
Lord Heo asked me to give this to you.

388
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:08,654
He said that you would need this to prove who you are.

389
00:29:17,389 --> 00:29:18,565
That way!

390
00:29:19,819 --> 00:29:20,934
Go!

391
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:24,464
Are you all right?

392
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:28,335
The person who saved Jung Yun Jeo was definitely a woman.

393
00:29:37,669 --> 00:29:39,740
I said I can go by myself. Goodness.

394
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,785
You are injured. How could I let you?

395
00:29:44,379 --> 00:29:45,855
Wait here.

396
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:47,924
It will not take long.

397
00:29:48,379 --> 00:29:49,894
Yes, I will wait.

398
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:54,295
See you soon.

399
00:30:12,139 --> 00:30:13,285
You missed him?

400
00:30:13,339 --> 00:30:15,515
How could you fail to catch him?

401
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:19,494
Please forgive me. I will find him at all costs.

402
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,325
Did you find anything else?

403
00:30:26,089 --> 00:30:27,934
I found this from Lord Heo's room.

404
00:30:28,389 --> 00:30:30,135
This document explains it.

405
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,865
Make sure you find Jung Yun Jeo.

406
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:59,565
I give you permission to kill him if necessary.

407
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:03,605
You just need to bring his corpse to me.

408
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:06,375
Yes, Your Majesty.

409
00:31:09,099 --> 00:31:10,444
Open the gate.

410
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:15,618
(Episode 20 will air shortly.)

411
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:38,604
(Episode 20)

412
00:31:55,476 --> 00:31:57,880
How long have you been plotting treason?

413
00:31:59,076 --> 00:32:00,350
Your Majesty.

414
00:32:01,576 --> 00:32:03,390
Was it 20 years ago...

415
00:32:03,515 --> 00:32:06,990
when you lied to me that you had killed Yun Jeo and that boy?

416
00:32:07,716 --> 00:32:08,890
Or...

417
00:32:13,996 --> 00:32:16,871
was it when you hid the document from the former king?

418
00:32:18,625 --> 00:32:19,665
I told you...

419
00:32:19,665 --> 00:32:21,866
to bring the document if you found it.

420
00:32:21,866 --> 00:32:23,810
However, you told me right away...

421
00:32:23,936 --> 00:32:26,251
that the document was burnt.

422
00:32:28,305 --> 00:32:29,681
Was this your agenda?

423
00:32:30,446 --> 00:32:31,845
Were you trying to dethrone me...

424
00:32:31,845 --> 00:32:34,750
and give the throne to someone who is more legitimate than me?

425
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:37,746
Your Majesty.

426
00:32:37,746 --> 00:32:38,886
You must have thought...

427
00:32:38,886 --> 00:32:40,315
that I did not have the right to the throne...

428
00:32:40,315 --> 00:32:42,060
just like everyone else.

429
00:32:42,725 --> 00:32:44,700
That is why you decided to abandon me...

430
00:32:44,725 --> 00:32:47,931
to serve under a new king.

431
00:32:59,306 --> 00:33:01,810
I deserve death, Your Majesty.

432
00:33:03,446 --> 00:33:04,681
Your Majesty.

433
00:33:05,175 --> 00:33:07,491
You can punish me all you want,

434
00:33:08,515 --> 00:33:10,046
but you cannot trust Grand Prince Neungyang...

435
00:33:10,046 --> 00:33:11,661
no matter what.

436
00:33:11,946 --> 00:33:13,455
He is...

437
00:33:13,455 --> 00:33:14,731
Grand Prince Neungyang?

438
00:33:15,455 --> 00:33:17,285
Are you still talking about him?

439
00:33:17,285 --> 00:33:19,261
Fine. Go ahead!

440
00:33:19,285 --> 00:33:22,500
Tell me how he is trying to plot treason.

441
00:33:28,895 --> 00:33:31,011
I managed to escort your family as I was worried...

442
00:33:31,106 --> 00:33:33,050
the royal guards might take them away.

443
00:33:33,606 --> 00:33:35,650
As long as you stay silent,

444
00:33:35,736 --> 00:33:37,920
I promise I will spare them.

445
00:33:40,616 --> 00:33:43,821
If you end this mess by taking full responsibility,

446
00:33:44,116 --> 00:33:46,531
your family might have a chance...

447
00:33:47,355 --> 00:33:49,561
to live their lives comfortably.

448
00:33:57,195 --> 00:33:59,471
This is all Grand Prince Neungyang's doing?

449
00:33:59,936 --> 00:34:01,011
Yes.

450
00:34:01,595 --> 00:34:03,381
He was framed for treason when he entered the palace...

451
00:34:03,635 --> 00:34:06,210
because of a long story between him and His Majesty.

452
00:34:06,936 --> 00:34:08,911
Then, is Grand Prince Neungyang...

453
00:34:09,575 --> 00:34:11,620
behind Lady Min's death?

454
00:34:12,505 --> 00:34:14,721
Grand Prince Neungyang told me the same thing.

455
00:34:15,045 --> 00:34:17,120
He told me that Lord Heo was behind all of this.

456
00:34:19,016 --> 00:34:21,456
Whose story must we believe?

457
00:34:21,456 --> 00:34:23,725
Please think long and hard how Grand Prince Neungyang...

458
00:34:23,725 --> 00:34:25,360
inserted himself into this mess.

459
00:34:27,225 --> 00:34:29,300
He is cruel and meticulous.

460
00:34:41,535 --> 00:34:44,105
There is only one place for him to spend his night in secret...

461
00:34:44,105 --> 00:34:45,420
during his outing in disguise.

462
00:34:45,676 --> 00:34:47,616
It is the best gisaeng house in Hanyang.

463
00:34:47,616 --> 00:34:49,661
The gisaeng house is at the foot of Mount Okmyuk.

464
00:34:56,926 --> 00:34:59,625
- Pour me a drink. - Thank you.

465
00:34:59,625 --> 00:35:01,026
- I would like a drink too. - Sure.

466
00:35:01,026 --> 00:35:03,670
Yes. I ought to pour you a drink.

467
00:35:04,866 --> 00:35:07,665
Your Majesty, could you take me to the palace...

468
00:35:07,665 --> 00:35:09,035
and make me your queen?

469
00:35:09,035 --> 00:35:10,541
Be quiet.

470
00:35:11,065 --> 00:35:13,450
Lower your voice.

471
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:20,545
All right. Chief State Councillor. Have a drink.

472
00:35:20,545 --> 00:35:23,321
You too. You ought to have a drink as well.

473
00:35:45,865 --> 00:35:47,180
You told me you do not like me.

474
00:35:47,636 --> 00:35:50,651
Okay, I get that. But you see,

475
00:35:51,576 --> 00:35:53,221
I am going to make you like me.

476
00:36:59,716 --> 00:37:01,146
Goodness!

477
00:37:01,146 --> 00:37:04,115
- Your Majesty. - My queen!

478
00:37:04,115 --> 00:37:06,415
If you will not listen to me,

479
00:37:06,415 --> 00:37:08,316
I will go to that king.

480
00:37:08,316 --> 00:37:10,185
Okay, then.

481
00:37:10,185 --> 00:37:12,925
I am a better king than he is.

482
00:37:12,925 --> 00:37:15,930
What are you talking about? You are drunk.

483
00:37:26,475 --> 00:37:27,610
Nok Du.

484
00:37:28,206 --> 00:37:29,206
Nok Du!

485
00:37:29,206 --> 00:37:31,481
Make sure you find Jung Yun Jeo.

486
00:37:31,605 --> 00:37:33,091
I give you permission...

487
00:37:33,716 --> 00:37:35,620
to kill him if necessary.

488
00:37:35,816 --> 00:37:38,360
You just need to bring his corpse to me.

489
00:37:54,865 --> 00:37:56,781
Are you looking for this?

490
00:38:14,956 --> 00:38:18,260
She is the Queen. Do show your respect.

491
00:38:23,196 --> 00:38:25,971
I apologize, Your Highness.

492
00:38:27,066 --> 00:38:28,570
I am...

493
00:38:28,995 --> 00:38:30,740
a chief administrative officer at the police bureau.

494
00:38:31,136 --> 00:38:34,351
I had visited the palace and lost it.

495
00:38:34,576 --> 00:38:36,351
But you seem...

496
00:38:37,576 --> 00:38:39,891
to be lost.

497
00:38:40,845 --> 00:38:41,990
Sorry?

498
00:38:46,146 --> 00:38:47,391
I am...

499
00:38:48,816 --> 00:38:50,231
not familiar with the palace yet.

500
00:38:54,756 --> 00:38:56,170
Take this.

501
00:38:56,495 --> 00:38:58,701
I know my way around this place.

502
00:39:03,665 --> 00:39:04,981
Thank you, Your Highness.

503
00:39:32,766 --> 00:39:34,740
Lord Heo asked me to give this to you.

504
00:39:35,365 --> 00:39:37,680
He said that you would need this to prove who you are.

505
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:33,030
What are you doing here looking all dazed?

506
00:40:36,665 --> 00:40:38,400
I was waiting for you.

507
00:40:39,896 --> 00:40:41,071
And you came.

508
00:40:44,435 --> 00:40:46,181
Why do you look so sullen?

509
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:49,211
Is someone tormenting you at the police bureau?

510
00:40:51,045 --> 00:40:52,221
I am.

511
00:40:52,646 --> 00:40:53,721
What?

512
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:56,321
I think I am tormenting everyone else.

513
00:40:59,346 --> 00:41:02,390
I should have lived a quiet life.

514
00:41:04,055 --> 00:41:05,701
That was the right thing to do.

515
00:41:06,695 --> 00:41:08,201
I made the wrong decision.

516
00:41:08,256 --> 00:41:10,295
- Hey... - I am lost.

517
00:41:10,295 --> 00:41:13,071
I wish someone could explain it to me.

518
00:41:14,136 --> 00:41:16,071
But I do not know...

519
00:41:19,035 --> 00:41:21,081
what to ask to whom in order for no one to get hurt.

520
00:41:24,175 --> 00:41:25,421
I have no idea.

521
00:41:26,276 --> 00:41:27,551
I am lost.

522
00:41:38,756 --> 00:41:40,400
I was blabbering too much.

523
00:41:40,726 --> 00:41:42,201
Forget it.

524
00:41:42,295 --> 00:41:45,240
Forget everything I just said.

525
00:41:46,226 --> 00:41:49,341
I had no idea what you were saying anyway.

526
00:41:50,965 --> 00:41:54,880
Enough with the pitying. Go home and get some rest.

527
00:41:55,136 --> 00:41:56,250
Go.

528
00:41:57,246 --> 00:41:58,246
Let me walk you home first.

529
00:41:58,246 --> 00:42:00,146
No one will welcome you there.

530
00:42:00,146 --> 00:42:01,851
- So leave. - No.

531
00:42:02,516 --> 00:42:04,561
You go wherever you please.

532
00:42:04,715 --> 00:42:06,620
Let me do the same.

533
00:42:10,656 --> 00:42:12,400
What? Hey.

534
00:42:15,955 --> 00:42:17,701
Go now.

535
00:42:18,596 --> 00:42:19,701
No.

536
00:42:22,795 --> 00:42:24,740
Do you still like me?

537
00:42:25,006 --> 00:42:27,051
I am always so coldhearted towards you.

538
00:42:29,876 --> 00:42:31,451
You look beautiful in my eyes.

539
00:42:33,915 --> 00:42:35,951
Why are you so complicated?

540
00:42:37,545 --> 00:42:41,290
What are you so afraid of?

541
00:42:41,915 --> 00:42:43,860
Why are you so fearless?

542
00:42:44,856 --> 00:42:47,101
You do not know what tomorrow will bring.

543
00:42:47,126 --> 00:42:49,096
That is exactly why...

544
00:42:49,096 --> 00:42:51,101
I say whatever I want.

545
00:42:52,396 --> 00:42:54,870
And I am walking you home because I want to.

546
00:43:01,976 --> 00:43:03,110
We should...

547
00:43:03,876 --> 00:43:05,120
hold hands as well.

548
00:43:08,376 --> 00:43:10,120
I will let go once we get to the end of this road.

549
00:43:12,616 --> 00:43:14,331
Then I should walk slowly.

550
00:43:35,535 --> 00:43:38,150
I was not aware of what happened at the chancellor's place.

551
00:43:38,506 --> 00:43:41,150
I am certain Jung Yun Jeo was there.

552
00:43:41,516 --> 00:43:43,585
We must catch him ourselves.

553
00:43:43,585 --> 00:43:45,085
I will head to Aseowon.

554
00:43:45,085 --> 00:43:46,931
Tail Nok Du for me.

555
00:43:46,955 --> 00:43:48,831
He will try to find his father.

556
00:43:53,925 --> 00:43:56,030
This is a drawing of Jung Yun Jeo.

557
00:43:56,256 --> 00:43:57,870
Move secretively.

558
00:44:37,406 --> 00:44:38,540
You...

559
00:44:39,935 --> 00:44:42,410
Do you still dress like a woman?

560
00:44:42,935 --> 00:44:45,181
I have my reasons.

561
00:44:45,705 --> 00:44:49,250
By the way, did you go to the chancellor's house, did you not?

562
00:44:50,185 --> 00:44:51,585
How do you know that?

563
00:44:51,585 --> 00:44:53,756
What happened to the man whom you rescued?

564
00:44:53,756 --> 00:44:56,561
How are his injuries?

565
00:44:57,856 --> 00:44:59,860
- He left that day... - Where to?

566
00:45:03,325 --> 00:45:06,071
He left because he could not trust me. He did not tell where.

567
00:45:08,565 --> 00:45:10,780
Who is he?

568
00:45:12,266 --> 00:45:13,750
He is my father.

569
00:45:15,805 --> 00:45:16,981
I see.

570
00:45:17,675 --> 00:45:20,821
He was slightly injured, but he left in good condition.

571
00:45:21,215 --> 00:45:22,715
He left with the chancellor's right hand,

572
00:45:22,715 --> 00:45:24,184
so do not worry.

573
00:45:24,185 --> 00:45:25,290
I see.

574
00:45:26,646 --> 00:45:29,461
By the way, why are you here?

575
00:45:30,486 --> 00:45:33,770
Will you take revenge on Grand Prince Neungyang?

576
00:45:34,825 --> 00:45:35,931
"Revenge"?

577
00:45:56,932 --> 00:46:01,932


578
00:46:23,006 --> 00:46:24,581
He is not home yet.

579
00:46:28,246 --> 00:46:30,421
Then could you give this to him?

580
00:46:30,915 --> 00:46:33,120
This is the only thing I know that he likes.

581
00:46:33,555 --> 00:46:36,231
You should wait and give it yourself.

582
00:46:37,526 --> 00:46:39,530
I need to go somewhere.

583
00:46:39,886 --> 00:46:43,201
Is that so? Then you can come back and give it to him.

584
00:46:55,776 --> 00:46:57,851
Please give this to him.

585
00:46:58,705 --> 00:46:59,851
Well, okay.

586
00:47:02,876 --> 00:47:04,346
Goodbye, then.

587
00:47:04,346 --> 00:47:05,520
Bye.

588
00:47:34,016 --> 00:47:35,520
Chief Administrative Officer?

589
00:47:42,486 --> 00:47:45,201
We came here because of you.

590
00:47:45,356 --> 00:47:47,656
Why do you look so frail...

591
00:47:47,656 --> 00:47:49,471
as if you have not eaten for days?

592
00:47:49,925 --> 00:47:52,400
Did you fail to catch a thief or something?

593
00:47:54,835 --> 00:47:56,971
I always fail to catch them.

594
00:47:58,965 --> 00:48:00,140
But...

595
00:48:01,236 --> 00:48:03,280
were you on your way to the gisaeng house?

596
00:48:03,945 --> 00:48:05,120
Yes.

597
00:48:06,276 --> 00:48:07,691
I had something to do there.

598
00:48:08,045 --> 00:48:10,250
I am sure you do not want to become a gisaeng.

599
00:48:10,346 --> 00:48:11,591
You are right. That is not why.

600
00:48:12,315 --> 00:48:15,061
I am trying hard to find a job as a servant in the palace.

601
00:48:16,215 --> 00:48:17,400
Your goal...

602
00:48:18,185 --> 00:48:20,301
is also to enter the palace?

603
00:48:20,455 --> 00:48:21,695
I heard you get to earn...

604
00:48:21,695 --> 00:48:23,601
a stable income if you get a job in the palace.

605
00:48:24,425 --> 00:48:25,640
I see.

606
00:48:30,505 --> 00:48:33,981
I guess you are still having trouble falling asleep.

607
00:48:34,975 --> 00:48:37,151
Have you not tried what I told you to do?

608
00:48:39,376 --> 00:48:40,990
No, I could not do it.

609
00:48:41,646 --> 00:48:43,191
It has been a long time...

610
00:48:44,286 --> 00:48:47,490
since I left my wife to be lonely all by herself.

611
00:48:48,755 --> 00:48:52,000
I could not dare to bother her and ask her to soothe me...

612
00:48:53,755 --> 00:48:55,725
after all those years.

613
00:48:55,725 --> 00:48:58,070
That is okay.

614
00:48:59,465 --> 00:49:01,471
You may have left her to be lonely for a long time.

615
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:04,080
But who knows? She might also be waiting for you.

616
00:49:05,435 --> 00:49:08,510
She might be waiting for you to reach out to her.

617
00:49:17,316 --> 00:49:22,731
(Inn)

618
00:49:29,695 --> 00:49:30,770
Boss.

619
00:49:31,165 --> 00:49:33,866
I will find those jerks tomorrow no matter what.

620
00:49:33,866 --> 00:49:35,735
You should stand guard and wait.

621
00:49:35,735 --> 00:49:36,810
Okay.

622
00:49:37,336 --> 00:49:39,411
Hey, you are...

623
00:49:40,475 --> 00:49:41,981
Look who is here.

624
00:49:42,505 --> 00:49:44,750
The foot of the lamp is always dark.

625
00:49:45,475 --> 00:49:47,745
I searched all over for you, but I could not find you.

626
00:49:47,745 --> 00:49:50,146
But we ended up meeting so nearby.

627
00:49:50,146 --> 00:49:51,520
I am so glad to see you.

628
00:49:52,015 --> 00:49:53,715
I think you have the wrong person.

629
00:49:53,715 --> 00:49:56,215
Oh, is that so?

630
00:49:56,215 --> 00:49:58,300
Let me see.

631
00:49:58,485 --> 00:50:00,495
- Boss! My goodness! - It hurts.

632
00:50:00,495 --> 00:50:02,156
Hurry up and run after her!

633
00:50:02,156 --> 00:50:04,171
- Let us go! - That little brat!

634
00:50:10,735 --> 00:50:12,611
(A plague has spread...)

635
00:50:17,705 --> 00:50:18,981
That little brat.

636
00:50:25,386 --> 00:50:26,816
Why do you keep running?

637
00:50:26,816 --> 00:50:29,691
My bottom hurts so much because of all the beating I got.

638
00:50:30,386 --> 00:50:33,260
Let me see. You stole my money,

639
00:50:33,755 --> 00:50:35,830
and you made me get a flogging.

640
00:50:39,896 --> 00:50:41,840
No, it is okay. Come here.

641
00:50:42,396 --> 00:50:43,671
Come here.

642
00:50:43,806 --> 00:50:45,611
It is dangerous. Get over here.

643
00:50:51,846 --> 00:50:52,921
My goodness.

644
00:50:53,346 --> 00:50:54,421
What...

645
00:50:56,376 --> 00:50:58,320
(A plague has spread...)

646
00:50:59,185 --> 00:51:00,715
Boss! Boss!

647
00:51:00,715 --> 00:51:02,015
My goodness, Boss!

648
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:03,786
What are you doing here?

649
00:51:03,786 --> 00:51:06,861
Everyone in this village died because of a plague.

650
00:51:07,495 --> 00:51:09,530
- A plague? - Yes.

651
00:51:12,796 --> 00:51:15,036
- She is dead. She has to be dead. - Yes.

652
00:51:15,036 --> 00:51:16,036
I bet she is dead.

653
00:51:16,036 --> 00:51:17,171
Move.

654
00:51:31,945 --> 00:51:34,661
- Master. - Hey, you are here.

655
00:51:34,856 --> 00:51:36,086
By the way,

656
00:51:36,086 --> 00:51:38,131
is there anything wrong with Dong Joo?

657
00:51:38,985 --> 00:51:42,455
- Why? - She dropped by earlier...

658
00:51:42,455 --> 00:51:44,371
and asked me to give you this.

659
00:51:44,995 --> 00:51:48,770
But she looked very desperate and sad.

660
00:52:07,286 --> 00:52:08,361
Where am I?

661
00:52:10,056 --> 00:52:12,260
Is anyone there?

662
00:52:12,755 --> 00:52:14,070
Hello?

663
00:52:15,255 --> 00:52:16,555
Help!

664
00:52:16,556 --> 00:52:18,471
Help! Someone is down here!

665
00:52:18,665 --> 00:52:19,971
Hello?

666
00:52:28,975 --> 00:52:31,421
Hello? Is anyone up there?

667
00:52:42,086 --> 00:52:44,000
Help!

668
00:52:47,156 --> 00:52:48,570
Hello?

669
00:52:48,896 --> 00:52:50,270
Is anyone there?

670
00:53:06,606 --> 00:53:09,151
My goodness, it is pouring.

671
00:53:12,685 --> 00:53:13,760
Hey.

672
00:53:14,985 --> 00:53:17,685
Are you sure that guy is not hiding her?

673
00:53:17,685 --> 00:53:19,161
He is also looking for her.

674
00:53:19,925 --> 00:53:21,901
Then maybe she just ran away...

675
00:53:22,656 --> 00:53:24,971
just like last time.

676
00:53:30,735 --> 00:53:31,810
No.

677
00:53:32,536 --> 00:53:33,881
There is no way.

678
00:53:34,306 --> 00:53:35,705
Then where could she be?

679
00:53:35,705 --> 00:53:38,451
You searched all over the city.

680
00:53:39,406 --> 00:53:40,505
I will be back.

681
00:53:40,505 --> 00:53:42,490
Hey, take this with you.

682
00:53:42,546 --> 00:53:44,020
Take this.

683
00:53:45,015 --> 00:53:46,090
Go on.

684
00:53:48,056 --> 00:53:50,290
My goodness.

685
00:53:56,126 --> 00:53:57,500
Help.

686
00:53:57,995 --> 00:54:00,540
Someone is down here!

687
00:54:10,505 --> 00:54:11,651
Help...

688
00:54:38,306 --> 00:54:39,406
Nice one.

689
00:54:39,406 --> 00:54:41,080
I need to go home now.

690
00:54:44,275 --> 00:54:45,876
- Let us try one more time. - My gosh.

691
00:54:45,876 --> 00:54:47,415
Hey, come on.

692
00:54:47,415 --> 00:54:48,951
That is not fair.

693
00:54:49,415 --> 00:54:51,445
- Let us try again. - No way.

694
00:54:51,445 --> 00:54:53,546
- My gosh, come on. - Stop it.

695
00:54:53,546 --> 00:54:55,691
I said I need to go home now.

696
00:55:00,356 --> 00:55:01,995
There is not much left.

697
00:55:01,995 --> 00:55:03,731
Boss!

698
00:55:05,475 --> 00:55:07,890
I finally found you, you darn jerk.

699
00:55:08,215 --> 00:55:10,661
- Get out of my way. - No.

700
00:55:11,255 --> 00:55:13,191
I am going to kill you today.

701
00:55:13,285 --> 00:55:14,586
I will let you meet...

702
00:55:14,586 --> 00:55:17,325
your girlfriend in paradise. You can look forward to it.

703
00:55:17,325 --> 00:55:18,400
What?

704
00:55:18,956 --> 00:55:21,941
Oh, I guess you did not know.

705
00:55:22,426 --> 00:55:24,040
She is dead.

706
00:55:24,995 --> 00:55:26,610
I killed her.

707
00:56:03,636 --> 00:56:04,781
We should...

708
00:56:05,575 --> 00:56:06,911
hold hands as well.

709
00:56:13,346 --> 00:56:14,961
I will let go once we get to the end of this road.

710
00:56:23,386 --> 00:56:25,001
Then I should walk slowly.

711
00:56:57,255 --> 00:56:58,431
Dong Joo!

712
00:57:06,265 --> 00:57:07,511
No, Dong Joo.

713
00:57:14,305 --> 00:57:15,781
No, Dong Joo.

714
00:57:18,275 --> 00:57:20,790
Dong Joo, wake up. No!

715
00:57:29,485 --> 00:57:30,661
Dong Joo.

716
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:33,900
Dong Joo, wake up. Dong Joo!

717
00:57:55,586 --> 00:57:57,815
I am ashamed to say this,

718
00:57:57,815 --> 00:58:00,060
but I cannot seem to fall asleep.

719
00:58:00,215 --> 00:58:02,060
Please forgive my bad manners.

720
00:58:02,586 --> 00:58:03,701
Pardon?

721
00:58:04,225 --> 00:58:06,271
It is not your fault.

722
00:58:07,255 --> 00:58:09,070
Everything is...

723
00:58:11,896 --> 00:58:14,511
Everything is my fault.

724
00:58:16,035 --> 00:58:17,380
Your Majesty.

725
00:58:18,805 --> 00:58:20,451
If it pleases you,

726
00:58:21,745 --> 00:58:23,320
could you...

727
00:58:24,475 --> 00:58:25,820
stay with me...

728
00:58:26,715 --> 00:58:28,521
tonight?

729
00:58:29,485 --> 00:58:30,721
Just like old times.

730
00:58:52,975 --> 00:58:55,550
Are you all right? Are you awake?

731
00:59:05,285 --> 00:59:08,461
What are you doing? You should not move around yet.

732
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:12,830
Go away. Go.

733
00:59:17,325 --> 00:59:18,411
Hey.

734
00:59:19,495 --> 00:59:20,971
How could you say that...

735
00:59:22,005 --> 00:59:23,481
to me?

736
00:59:24,035 --> 00:59:26,050
Do you know how worried I was?

737
00:59:26,475 --> 00:59:28,120
Did I ask you to worry about me?

738
00:59:30,005 --> 00:59:31,820
Why did you look for me?

739
00:59:32,075 --> 00:59:34,461
Why did you jump into the well?

740
00:59:46,025 --> 00:59:47,771
What is going on with you?

741
00:59:54,065 --> 00:59:55,065
Dong Joo.

742
00:59:55,065 --> 00:59:56,741
I had a task to fulfill.

743
00:59:57,136 --> 00:59:59,905
I have been living my whole life trying to complete my task.

744
00:59:59,906 --> 01:00:01,550
Once I was done with it...

745
01:00:02,475 --> 01:00:05,090
When I join my mother after completing my task,

746
01:00:05,275 --> 01:00:07,150
I thought I could be really happy.

747
01:00:08,116 --> 01:00:10,320
That was the reason I lived for.

748
01:00:11,515 --> 01:00:12,731
But...

749
01:00:13,015 --> 01:00:15,300
I was about to die even before completing my task.

750
01:00:16,086 --> 01:00:17,231
Why...

751
01:00:18,096 --> 01:00:19,431
Why did it have to be you?

752
01:00:22,666 --> 01:00:24,570
Why did I think of you?

753
01:00:24,868 --> 01:00:27,384
Why did I only think of you at that moment?

754
01:00:29,436 --> 01:00:31,781
You keep making me want to live.

755
01:00:32,505 --> 01:00:34,380
You keep...

756
01:00:40,416 --> 01:00:41,521
I do not know...

757
01:00:43,686 --> 01:00:46,231
what you are trying to fulfill at the expense...

758
01:00:47,116 --> 01:00:48,961
of distancing yourself from me.

759
01:00:50,126 --> 01:00:52,600
I do not know what you are afraid of.

760
01:00:53,896 --> 01:00:55,340
But whatever that may be...

761
01:00:56,126 --> 01:00:58,271
or whatever happens to us,

762
01:00:58,965 --> 01:01:01,310
we are alive and together now.

763
01:01:05,906 --> 01:01:07,411
So...

764
01:01:08,305 --> 01:01:10,550
can you not follow your heart and just like me?

765
01:01:13,775 --> 01:01:15,090
I just...

766
01:01:15,886 --> 01:01:17,021
like...

767
01:01:19,656 --> 01:01:20,761
I really...

768
01:01:21,586 --> 01:01:23,100
like you.

769
01:01:24,995 --> 01:01:26,271
I like you.

770
01:01:27,256 --> 01:01:29,240
Fine. I like you.

771
01:01:30,265 --> 01:01:33,040
I like you so much that I am about to lose my mind.
