00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.335
Name, Ahn Gyeong Nam.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.574
(Episode 1)

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.239
- That's very nice. - Would you like to seal the deal?

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.454
Also known as DiCaprio of Cheongdam-dong.

00:00:56.679 --> 00:00:59.179
It takes him exactly 48 hours for him to approach a woman...

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:00.725
and take every penny from her.

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:04.249
The moment he unfolds his scheme, he takes all of her assets,

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:06.964
including her property, real estate, and everything he can take.

00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:11.134
Then he suddenly disappears, changes his identity,

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.365
and reappears on the scene.

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.730
A total of four jurisdictions were fooled by this guy.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.305
Even the Regional Investigation Unit tried to find him but got nothing.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.275
Do you understand how awesome...

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.884
what you've done is?

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.984
Gosh, that's my boy.

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:31.085
You should've been my partner.

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:39.865
Darn it.

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.165
What is this?

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:43.895
Hey.

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:47.835
You can't just leave like that.

00:01:56.669 --> 00:01:57.815
Hey.

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:04.624
- What is this? - Darn it.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.294
Why are you getting fussy even after I paid you?

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.325
Today is an important day,

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:15.519
so I want to avoid getting in trouble.

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:16.994
Man.

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:30.344
- Let me go. - Is it that hard to apologize?

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.139
You finally got him.

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:36.739
Ahn Gyeong Nam. You're under emergency arrest...

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:38.010
for deception, fraud, and forging official documents.

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.250
You have the right to an attorney.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.149
and you have the right to remain silent. You know that.

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:44.149
- What are you talking about? - That's not right.

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:45.694
- He's not Ahn Gyeong Nam. - What are you saying?

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.365
What are you two saying?

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.489
Why did you catch him if you didn't think he was Ahn?

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.660
Yes, why did you catch me?

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:52.865
Honey!

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.305
- Hey, Ahn Gyeong Nam! - She means you.

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:00.075
Ahn... Ahn Gyeong Nam?

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.545
What's with your outfit?

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:05.910
Oh, right.

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.385
Hey, where are you going?

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:08.955
("Hidden Killer")

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:13.985
- Thank you! - Thanks!

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.795
(Webtoon artist Maru's book signing)

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:26.964
("Hidden Killer")

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.705
I'm sorry, but could you take a picture with me?

00:03:33.899 --> 00:03:37.344
I'm sorry. We can't do pictures.

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:40.015
I'm sorry.

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.079
The contract said we'll go until 3pm, right?

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:45.555
We have 15 minutes left.

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:56.335
Yes. Next, please.

00:04:01.929 --> 00:04:03.534
Gosh, "Hidden Killer"!

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:05.545
Darn it.

00:04:52.149 --> 00:04:53.479
What is this?

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:55.195
The book signing is over. I'm sorry.

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:58.794
Maru, I love you!

00:04:59.149 --> 00:05:00.525
I'm here!

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.395
Maru, I love you!

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:03.995
Maru! Please sign this.

00:05:04.829 --> 00:05:06.729
- Maru! - Please look at me!

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:08.205
(Evidence 1, Evidence 4)

00:05:10.829 --> 00:05:13.745
How did he become you?

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.370
A nurse at a plastic surgery hospital...

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.370
could turn into a mighty doctor after 10 years.

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.039
My wife wants to get a blepharoptosis surgery.

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:23.685
I should recommend you to her.

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:28.195
You should've been meticulous and changed your fingerprints too.

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:30.294
I guess your love wasn't that strong.

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:31.464
File this right away.

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.065
You said we wouldn't get caught!

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:35.464
You should've deleted the CCTV footages at the hospital!

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.364
Be quiet. This is a police station.

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:40.364
She wants you to shut it.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.159
- Should Sa Kyung do it? - DiCaprio will only...

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:46.829
start talking once she interrogates him.

00:05:46.829 --> 00:05:48.500
DiCaprio, my foot.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.000
- How do you want your coffee? - Two shots, please.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.885
- 2 shots. Got it. - I added 3 shots.

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.585
- That's fine. - She said it's fine. Go on.

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:56.515
Who will interrogate the mighty doctor?

00:05:56.579 --> 00:05:58.255
Soon Woo, you go.

00:05:58.709 --> 00:06:00.625
- Can you do it? - Do you mean it?

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:03.979
Sure. Since you caught her, you should do it yourself.

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:05.820
Thank you! Thank you!

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.490
- How do you want your coffee? - No, let me.

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.490
Come on, this is your first time with the interrogation. Let me.

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:12.265
Then I'd like three shots as well.

00:06:12.329 --> 00:06:13.635
Three shots? Okay.

00:06:18.399 --> 00:06:19.904
Did you get her autograph?

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:22.674
No, I couldn't even get in line.

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:24.739
You sound very proud.

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.409
You committed dereliction of duty.

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:28.209
Don't be absurd. I requested for a half-day off but ended up...

00:06:28.209 --> 00:06:30.085
working two more hours, asking around.

00:06:30.209 --> 00:06:32.579
- I went to the department store, - He's been here before, right?

00:06:32.579 --> 00:06:35.578
- a foreign car dealership... - He bought a car here, right?

00:06:35.579 --> 00:06:36.849
Didn't he check out this house?

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:38.964
I even visited all the real estate properties for sale.

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:45.034
But your mind was somewhere else.

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:46.889
Even after we had caught him,

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:49.130
he was confused.

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:52.130
How was I to recognize him when he got extreme surgery done?

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:53.529
You should've given me an updated photo.

00:06:53.529 --> 00:06:54.769
You're always blaming me.

00:06:54.769 --> 00:06:56.114
Be quiet.

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:58.645
So? Who caught him?

00:06:58.709 --> 00:07:00.885
- What do you mean? - Ahn Gyeong Nam.

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:02.709
So Hyeong Ju caught him first.

00:07:02.709 --> 00:07:04.909
- Not at all. - Yes, I caught him.

00:07:04.909 --> 00:07:06.649
I'm the one who cuffed him.

00:07:06.649 --> 00:07:08.554
You could cuff him, thanks to me.

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:10.094
I'll write the report.

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:12.224
- Come here, you punk. - You can stay there.

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:15.335
How dare you try to take credit for something you didn't do?

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:17.664
I've recently learned a new move.

00:07:17.889 --> 00:07:19.130
- Gosh. - Come here.

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:21.875
- Enough, already. - You little...

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:23.904
Hold on. I'm not supposed to be the one in this position.

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:35.714
It's freezing.

00:07:35.779 --> 00:07:37.154
Goodness.

00:07:37.909 --> 00:07:39.625
You must've worked late.

00:07:45.589 --> 00:07:46.695
Oh Myung Chul?

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:49.364
You have an excellent memory.

00:07:49.959 --> 00:07:51.734
It's been seven years.

00:07:53.029 --> 00:07:54.835
- Where did you get that gun? - This?

00:07:56.229 --> 00:07:57.734
I borrowed it.

00:07:59.769 --> 00:08:01.575
Are you sad that you were discharged too soon?

00:08:02.099 --> 00:08:03.275
Do you want to go back?

00:08:06.469 --> 00:08:07.784
Do as you please.

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:09.685
But it'll only be three months.

00:08:10.579 --> 00:08:13.025
After seven years behind bars,

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:16.395
I found out I have a brain tumor.

00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:20.164
When I heard that,

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:22.364
you were the first person I thought of.

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:25.904
I can't bear to die alone.

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:32.304
That prosecutor who indicted me...

00:08:32.829 --> 00:08:35.044
and the judge who sentenced me to jail...

00:08:35.369 --> 00:08:37.544
- are dead now. - You're a lunatic!

00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:41.314
Don't provoke a lunatic.

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:43.814
After all, I'm holding a gun.

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:48.995
You're my last target.

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:53.324
I thought long and hard about how to take my revenge.

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:54.995
But someone said...

00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:58.904
the killing would be too easy.

00:08:59.229 --> 00:09:02.334
It's better to let you live in pain until the day you die.

00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:05.400
That's true revenge.

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:06.674
Oh Myung Chul.

00:09:14.663 --> 00:09:15.807
Hey.

00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:18.924
Guess whom I borrowed this from.

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:22.054
Here. Until when can you get it fixed?

00:09:22.379 --> 00:09:25.520
It's an old model, so I'll be done by tomorrow afternoon.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:26.924
I don't have the parts for it right now.

00:09:31.359 --> 00:09:32.664
Hello?

00:09:33.229 --> 00:09:36.934
The owner of this phone has collapsed outside his house.

00:09:37.099 --> 00:09:39.605
I think you should come here quickly.

00:09:46.209 --> 00:09:48.755
You should hurry home.

00:09:51.109 --> 00:09:53.255
I left a gift for you.

00:09:56.619 --> 00:09:57.895
You scumbag...

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:08.095
Sun Ho.

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:10.834
Sun Ho.

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:14.735
Sun Ho.

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:19.804
But someone said the killing would be too easy.

00:11:21.329 --> 00:11:24.444
It's better to let you live in pain until the day you die.

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:26.745
That's true revenge.

00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:54.574
Walk slowly. Land on the heel first.

00:11:54.729 --> 00:11:57.544
Good. You can take your time.

00:11:57.570 --> 00:11:59.184
Now, left foot.

00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:01.270
You're doing well.

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:03.584
Focus on your right heel.

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:06.525
Bend your knee. You're doing well.

00:12:06.979 --> 00:12:10.424
Slowly. Control your breathing.

00:12:10.849 --> 00:12:11.995
Start with your heel.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.574
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

00:12:25.729 --> 00:12:28.845
Wait a minute. We're kind of in a hurry. I'm sorry.

00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:31.715
- I'm sorry. Thank you. - Gosh.

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:34.645
If you have no physical defects, get out.

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:12.725
(Underground Parking Lot)

00:13:17.349 --> 00:13:19.564
- It's freezing. - It is.

00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:23.934
Ga Hyeon!

00:13:29.959 --> 00:13:31.034
Were you already done?

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:33.005
You should've waited inside.

00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:36.369
I'm sorry. I came as fast as I could after delivering the final copy.

00:13:36.369 --> 00:13:39.609
That's okay. You two are also doing my share of work.

00:13:39.609 --> 00:13:41.015
I don't mind getting wet.

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:42.914
It's fine.

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:44.654
Why are you here?

00:13:45.249 --> 00:13:46.479
- Ga Hyeon... - I came here alone,

00:13:46.479 --> 00:13:47.824
so I'll leave alone as well.

00:14:05.829 --> 00:14:07.729
I told you to go. Why are you still here?

00:14:07.729 --> 00:14:09.674
Well, it's...

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:11.515
I'll do it.

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:20.054
Hey, I'm going out to the convenience store.

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:29.334
I'm going to sleep. Tell me what you came to say.

00:14:29.589 --> 00:14:32.930
It's about dining with my parents this weekend.

00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:34.259
They can't, can they?

00:14:34.259 --> 00:14:37.498
No, something urgent suddenly came up.

00:14:37.499 --> 00:14:38.845
Not that.

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:42.115
They can't let you...

00:14:44.469 --> 00:14:45.814
marry me, can they?

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:49.810
No, it's not like that. Give them a little more time...

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:53.154
I'm glad. I can't do it either.

00:14:54.249 --> 00:14:57.025
I don't want to marry you, Woo Jin.

00:14:57.719 --> 00:15:00.219
- What? - You're just an assistant manager,

00:15:00.219 --> 00:15:01.995
and you'll be working at a company for life.

00:15:02.259 --> 00:15:04.965
I'll lose too much if I marry you.

00:15:07.589 --> 00:15:09.105
Although I may look like this,

00:15:09.599 --> 00:15:11.129
I make a fortune.

00:15:11.129 --> 00:15:13.904
- Shin Ga Hyeon. - I'll ask your company...

00:15:14.599 --> 00:15:16.414
to change the person in charge.

00:15:21.609 --> 00:15:23.280
I know it's hard.

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:24.985
But it's not just you.

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:28.755
I'm tired of this too.

00:16:02.249 --> 00:16:03.554
Did you two fight?

00:16:05.619 --> 00:16:06.924
No, I ended it.

00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:09.920
You know how tough...

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:12.060
things are for him and how much he's trying.

00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:13.664
That's why I ended it.

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:16.975
I didn't want to see him pretend to have a tough time and try hard.

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:19.275
- What? - The same goes for you too.

00:16:19.369 --> 00:16:20.469
Hey, Shin Ga Hyeon.

00:16:20.469 --> 00:16:22.615
You need to stop pretending and put an end to this too.

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:25.245
I know you're holding out to debut by using me as your connection.

00:16:25.369 --> 00:16:28.515
- I'll put in a good word, so... - How can you be that cruel?

00:16:30.609 --> 00:16:32.654
Do you know how much we did for you?

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:36.355
Exactly. So put an end to this. Please!

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:41.625
Your legs...

00:16:42.359 --> 00:16:44.294
aren't your only disability.

00:16:46.829 --> 00:16:48.005
Right here.

00:16:48.959 --> 00:16:50.674
You're broken here.

00:16:51.859 --> 00:16:52.975

(Violent Crimes Investigation)

Ji Hyeong Ju.

00:19:11.769 --> 00:19:13.215
Stop calling my name!

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:17.255
It's my first time calling.

00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:19.580
It's my 1st time in 10 months.

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:21.025
I was happy to see you.

00:19:24.219 --> 00:19:26.665
I thought you were coming back to work next week.

00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:28.495
Why are you here already?

00:19:30.989 --> 00:19:32.735
How long will you keep doing this?

00:19:32.959 --> 00:19:34.330
Get a hold of yourself.

Sun Ho keeps calling my name everywhere I go. How can return?

How can I stay here?

00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:43.340
Exactly. You need to go to the hospital.

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:45.114
You never went to a counseling session, right?

00:19:45.299 --> 00:19:47.445
You need to at least make some effort.

00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:51.509
I'll just try to forget it and move on.

Do you think... Do you think doing this will help you forget?

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:04.665
The operation went well for that jerk, Oh Myung Chul.

00:20:04.789 --> 00:20:07.489
It was so successful that his case can be made into a paper.

00:20:07.489 --> 00:20:10.905
He'll live a long time in prison on taxpayers' money.

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:14.044
So why are you living like this?

00:20:15.769 --> 00:20:17.339
If you don't want to go to the police hospital...

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:20.110

Whatever. There's a psychiatrist...

who's the best in the field.

00:20:25.709 --> 00:20:27.749
It's really hard to get an appointment there,

00:20:27.749 --> 00:20:30.054
but if you're up for it, I'll try to get one.

00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:40.935
I never got this resignation, okay?

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:43.435
I turned it in.

as we welcome the new year with racing hearts.

There were 387 people on board,

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:13.819
and we do not have the number of casualties yet.

00:22:13.819 --> 00:22:17.019
President Baek Gyeong Ah held an emergency briefing at...

00:22:17.019 --> 00:22:19.930
and said the cause of the accident has not been confirmed yet.

00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:22.700
He said he'll find out the cause once the investigation...

00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:25.475
by Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board is over.

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:28.130

to begin the recovery.

00:22:29.969 --> 00:22:31.799
The  Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport said...

00:22:31.799 --> 00:22:35.515
they'll do their best to reduce the casualties.

00:22:36.279 --> 00:22:37.309
Yes?

Who... Who are you?

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:45.455
Did you do this?

00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:47.590
You might misunderstand it and take it that way.

00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:50.559
But do you think I could have known the number of casualties...

00:22:50.559 --> 00:22:52.289
- News flash. - beforehand?

00:22:52.289 --> 00:22:55.529
We found out that there were 2 deaths and 58 wounded.

00:22:55.529 --> 00:22:57.900
Among 387 people on board, 2 will die...

and 58 will be injured.

00:23:21.489 --> 00:23:23.788
are you telling me this?

I'm Lee Shin, a psychiatrist.

00:28:09.039 --> 00:28:13.025
First off, I thank all of you for coming out here today.

00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:17.124
Did you all greet one another while you waited?

00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:21.064
We just shared our names.

00:28:21.249 --> 00:28:22.834
When you said we can go back in time,

00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:24.935
do you literally mean we can go back?

00:28:26.489 --> 00:28:28.564
Yes, you're right.

00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:30.430
There are a few rules,

00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:32.405
but we're actually going back in time.

00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:37.074
Going back to the past and repeating your life.

00:28:38.039 --> 00:28:39.415
I call this...

I call this...

"Reset"?

00:28:58.282 --> 00:29:00.123
- "Reset"? - "Reset"?

00:29:00.123 --> 00:29:02.738
- "Reset"? - How is that possible?

00:29:04.862 --> 00:29:07.707
By chance, I discovered a gap in time and space.

00:29:09.933 --> 00:29:12.977
Are we going back on a time machine through that gap?

00:29:16.372 --> 00:29:19.248
It might feel somewhat similar to that.

00:29:20.213 --> 00:29:21.487
However,

00:29:22.342 --> 00:29:24.218
The fundamentals behind it are completely different.

00:29:25.683 --> 00:29:27.987
You won't be going back physically.

00:29:28.783 --> 00:29:32.258
Through the gap in time and space, you will be sending...

00:29:33.622 --> 00:29:35.937
only your memories to your old selves.

00:29:44.162 --> 00:29:47.548
So you're going to give that incredible chance only to us?

00:29:48.273 --> 00:29:50.277
What's the standard you based on?

00:29:51.342 --> 00:29:53.848
I didn't have specific criteria in selecting you.

00:29:54.573 --> 00:29:56.812
I made calls randomly.

00:29:56.812 --> 00:29:59.613
And people who believed me and came here today...

00:29:59.613 --> 00:30:01.688
will be offered to reset their lives.

00:30:01.982 --> 00:30:04.357
This feels like a pyramid scheme.

00:30:08.223 --> 00:30:11.392
If you don't feel comfortable, you can leave now.

00:30:11.392 --> 00:30:12.693
That just means you're not ready...

00:30:12.693 --> 00:30:15.262
to experience your lucky chance of going back in time.

00:30:15.262 --> 00:30:16.908
You said there were a few rules.

00:30:17.702 --> 00:30:19.038
What are the rules?

00:30:19.372 --> 00:30:23.348
You can only go back exactly a year before today.

00:30:23.573 --> 00:30:25.573
In other words, exactly a week from today,

00:30:25.573 --> 00:30:28.973
on January 11, 2020 at 10am,

00:30:28.973 --> 00:30:33.482
you will be going back to January 11, 2019 at 10am.

00:30:33.482 --> 00:30:35.782
If I'm going back, I should go back to my youth.

00:30:35.782 --> 00:30:37.553
A year isn't that long ago.

00:30:37.553 --> 00:30:39.398
There's no point in going back then.

00:30:40.823 --> 00:30:42.738
You may say that's not much,

00:30:42.963 --> 00:30:46.167
but a lot more things will change.

00:30:46.963 --> 00:30:48.568
For example,

00:30:49.902 --> 00:30:51.032
how about the lottery?

00:30:51.032 --> 00:30:52.707
The lottery?

00:30:53.933 --> 00:30:55.808
As it so happens, they announce the winning numbers today.

00:30:56.743 --> 00:30:58.177
Why don't we check?

00:31:07.683 --> 00:31:10.558
Good luck to you, viewers.

00:31:14.053 --> 00:31:16.662
All right. I can't wait to find out...

00:31:16.662 --> 00:31:19.222
- what numbers will bring luck. - The first number...

00:31:19.222 --> 00:31:20.933
- is 34. - The balls are spinning now.

00:31:20.933 --> 00:31:23.008
The first lucky number is...

00:31:23.733 --> 00:31:25.102
34.

00:31:25.102 --> 00:31:27.703
- Let's find out the second number. - What?

00:31:27.703 --> 00:31:29.172
- The next number is three. - Let's continue.

00:31:29.173 --> 00:31:31.203
- It's number three. - What?

00:31:31.203 --> 00:31:33.788
- This is the 3rd winning number. - It's 15.

00:31:34.713 --> 00:31:36.158
It's 15.

00:31:36.483 --> 00:31:38.543
Next up is the fourth number.

00:31:38.543 --> 00:31:40.288
- 44. - I wonder what number it will be.

00:31:40.483 --> 00:31:42.357
It's number 44.

00:31:43.352 --> 00:31:46.667
- It's time to pick the 5th number. - It's 13.

00:31:46.993 --> 00:31:48.327
It's 13.

00:31:48.453 --> 00:31:51.938
- Let's find out the last number. - 17.

00:31:53.393 --> 00:31:54.938
It's 17.

00:31:55.132 --> 00:31:58.408
- We should pick 1 more ball. - The bonus number is 27.

00:31:59.233 --> 00:32:00.808
It's 27.

00:32:04.342 --> 00:32:07.013
If I reset my life, does it mean I can win the lottery too?

00:32:07.013 --> 00:32:09.688
My gosh, this is a very good chance.

00:32:10.043 --> 00:32:12.412
I should quit my job as a security guard at an apartment.

00:32:12.412 --> 00:32:14.213
I can buy a big mansion...

00:32:14.213 --> 00:32:15.683
and live however I want.

00:32:15.683 --> 00:32:18.683
My gosh. I should write down all the winning numbers for a year.

00:32:18.683 --> 00:32:19.923
Same here.

00:32:19.923 --> 00:32:22.068
- You cannot do that. - What?

00:32:22.393 --> 00:32:24.938
Your notes won't be there once you go back.

00:32:32.463 --> 00:32:33.808
You can only...

00:32:35.572 --> 00:32:37.872
take your own memories.

00:32:37.872 --> 00:32:41.748
So you must memorize anything you deem important.

00:32:43.143 --> 00:32:45.243
Please memorize them to take them with you.

00:32:45.243 --> 00:32:47.058
My gosh. Memorize them?

00:32:47.583 --> 00:32:48.857
What about...

00:32:50.222 --> 00:32:51.628
my baby?

00:32:54.523 --> 00:32:58.023
It will be a year ago, so the baby wouldn't have been conceived.

00:32:58.023 --> 00:33:00.537
That means my baby won't be there.

00:33:04.033 --> 00:33:06.178
You make the final calls.

00:33:06.772 --> 00:33:09.548
I'll respect your decisions.

00:33:09.872 --> 00:33:12.517
Think about it. For those of you who are up for it,

00:33:12.872 --> 00:33:14.318
I'll meet you on Saturday.

00:33:22.053 --> 00:33:24.228
Gosh, how can I memorize it?

00:33:44.142 --> 00:33:45.347
Isn't it ridiculous?

00:33:46.442 --> 00:33:47.748
Isn't it baffling?

00:33:49.372 --> 00:33:51.242
Imagine how I felt.

00:33:51.243 --> 00:33:54.587
If you were there, you'd want to arrest her for fraud.

Salute.

00:34:03.962 --> 00:34:06.967
Don't do that. Do you start working tomorrow?

00:34:07.233 --> 00:34:08.668
Go home.

00:34:08.733 --> 00:34:10.433
Take him with you since he's here anyway.

00:34:10.433 --> 00:34:11.577
No, you can go home.

Hey! You punk!

00:34:44.502 --> 00:34:46.137

Sun Ho.

00:34:48.033 --> 00:34:50.378
If you leave like this, I'm going to kill you.

I'm going to do it.

00:35:16.462 --> 00:35:18.037
I know it sounds crazy.

00:35:19.303 --> 00:35:21.207
But if I could bring you back,

00:35:24.603 --> 00:35:26.118
I'd do anything.

00:35:40.423 --> 00:35:43.337
Oh, dear. I guess the pregnant lady didn't show up.

00:35:43.622 --> 00:35:44.938
I guess not.

00:35:54.603 --> 00:35:56.318
You'll depart now.

A week after your arrival,

00:36:00.312 --> 00:36:02.387
we'll be meeting here again...

00:36:03.343 --> 00:36:05.957
so that I can make sure the reset has no problems...

00:36:10.582 --> 00:36:13.668

What's wrong with him?

You scared me.

00:38:22.383 --> 00:38:25.397
You shouldn't collapse before getting hit.

00:38:25.722 --> 00:38:26.897
You should get hit...

00:38:27.852 --> 00:38:29.222
and then collapse.

00:38:29.222 --> 00:38:32.498

You have the right to an attorney.

to update Ahn Gyeong Nam's information?

and take every penny from her.

00:43:19.342 --> 00:43:21.312
The moment he unfolds his scheme, he takes all of her assets,

including her property, real estate, and everything he can take.

- I'm coming. - Why?

00:44:02.852 --> 00:44:04.692
- Did he just wake up? - What's wrong with him?

00:44:04.692 --> 00:44:05.968
Come back in.

00:44:08.062 --> 00:44:09.338
What is this?

00:44:12.503 --> 00:44:14.232
I finished interrogating her earlier.

00:44:14.232 --> 00:44:15.503
Who is he?

00:44:15.503 --> 00:44:18.248
The surveillance footage of the clinic she works at.

00:44:18.273 --> 00:44:19.873
You have been very busy with your creation...

00:44:19.873 --> 00:44:21.517
when the clinic closed.

00:44:22.673 --> 00:44:23.758
Ahn Gyeong Nam?

00:44:25.013 --> 00:44:26.543
- What? - Ahn Gyeong Nam...

00:44:26.543 --> 00:44:28.312
- Gosh. - Why...

00:44:28.312 --> 00:44:31.123
Why didn't you make him look like DiCaprio since you were at it?

00:44:31.123 --> 00:44:33.023
Hey, how did you figure this out?

00:44:33.023 --> 00:44:35.328
It doesn't matter how I got them. It's important that I did.

00:44:35.692 --> 00:44:36.893
- Captain Heo. - Yes?

00:44:36.893 --> 00:44:37.962
Didn't you tell me that you'd let me...

00:44:37.962 --> 00:44:39.523
take consecutive days off if I catch him?

00:44:39.523 --> 00:44:41.267
Yes. I did.

00:44:41.592 --> 00:44:45.232
I would love to let you do that, but you know that's impossible.

00:44:45.232 --> 00:44:47.202
Okay. Then, let me get half a day off.

00:44:47.202 --> 00:44:49.332
And put Sun Ho on the night shift.

00:44:49.332 --> 00:44:51.572
Me? Me on the night shift? Why?

00:44:51.572 --> 00:44:53.348
I'm taking Soon Woo someplace nice.

00:44:53.673 --> 00:44:56.173
- Deal? - Sure. It doesn't matter for me.

00:44:56.173 --> 00:44:57.612
What does that mean?

00:44:57.612 --> 00:44:58.758
I'll call you.

00:44:59.242 --> 00:45:00.913
A nurse at a plastic surgery hospital...

00:45:00.913 --> 00:45:02.612
could turn into a mighty doctor after 10 years.

00:45:02.612 --> 00:45:05.253
Wait a minute. I'm his senior though.

00:45:05.253 --> 00:45:06.653
You said we wouldn't get caught!

00:45:06.653 --> 00:45:08.698
You should've deleted the CCTV footages at the hospital!

00:45:08.952 --> 00:45:11.062
Be quiet. This is a police station.

00:45:11.062 --> 00:45:12.598
(General Trash)

00:45:16.862 --> 00:45:17.937
This jerk...

00:45:25.143 --> 00:45:27.643
Guess whom I borrowed this from.

00:45:27.643 --> 00:45:29.887
I left a gift for you.

00:45:34.153 --> 00:45:35.488
Mr. Oh Myung Chul.

00:45:37.982 --> 00:45:41.423
My gosh. How did you find me here?

00:45:41.423 --> 00:45:43.392
I heard that you got out.

00:45:43.393 --> 00:45:45.492
I was wondering how you've been doing.

00:45:45.492 --> 00:45:47.067
As if.

00:45:47.232 --> 00:45:49.238
I can tell that you're here to spy on me.

00:45:51.163 --> 00:45:52.978
At least, you didn't come empty-handed.

00:45:54.532 --> 00:45:56.772
Did you find a job?

00:45:56.772 --> 00:45:58.678
Sometimes.

00:45:59.242 --> 00:46:01.718
I'm mostly unemployed though. That's how it is.

00:46:02.242 --> 00:46:04.017
I'm not sure if this is safe to eat this.

00:46:04.442 --> 00:46:05.787
You didn't poison this, right?

00:46:10.522 --> 00:46:13.027
(CT Room, Emergency Room, Injection Room)

00:46:23.633 --> 00:46:25.738
Let's go grab some soju.

00:46:27.173 --> 00:46:29.408
My gosh, you've had enough.

00:46:30.603 --> 00:46:32.942
I'm going to die anyway.

00:46:32.942 --> 00:46:34.918
Let me at least choose when to stop.

00:46:35.413 --> 00:46:37.017
Fine. Let me pour you one.

00:46:40.383 --> 00:46:42.087
I must've lived long enough.

00:46:42.683 --> 00:46:44.698
A detective is pouring me a drink.

00:46:47.893 --> 00:46:49.428
To be honest,

00:46:50.423 --> 00:46:52.898
I resented you a lot.

00:46:52.923 --> 00:46:54.938
Most of criminals like me do.

00:46:55.063 --> 00:46:57.063
We don't think about our crimes.

00:46:57.063 --> 00:46:59.008
We just look for someone to vent our anger on.

00:46:59.633 --> 00:47:01.433
You weren't the only one.

00:47:01.433 --> 00:47:03.802
That prosecutor who indicted me...

00:47:03.802 --> 00:47:05.772
and the judge who sentenced me to jail.

00:47:05.772 --> 00:47:09.772
I thought about countless times how I could get even with them.

00:47:09.772 --> 00:47:11.883
I can't bear to die alone.

00:47:11.883 --> 00:47:13.583
That prosecutor who indicted me...

00:47:13.583 --> 00:47:15.083
and the judge who sentenced me to jail...

00:47:15.083 --> 00:47:16.998
are dead now.

00:47:20.492 --> 00:47:23.797
So what is it? Since you're dying anyway,

00:47:24.292 --> 00:47:26.198
will you kill all of us?

00:47:33.802 --> 00:47:37.002
If that was my plan, do you think I'd tell you about this?

00:47:37.002 --> 00:47:38.202
If it weren't for you,

00:47:38.202 --> 00:47:41.218
I could have died in front of my house. Who knows?

00:47:44.143 --> 00:47:45.888
Seven years of anger...

00:47:46.313 --> 00:47:48.627
is washed away in one day.

00:47:48.752 --> 00:47:50.923
Hold on. Let's get one more drink.

00:47:50.923 --> 00:47:52.898
- Think about your health. - One more drink.

00:47:54.393 --> 00:47:55.728
Put on your seatbelt.

00:47:55.893 --> 00:47:59.198
- Wait. Detective Ji. Hold on. - My gosh.

00:47:59.492 --> 00:48:00.908
Detective Ji.

00:48:01.333 --> 00:48:04.603
Will you be my drinking buddy again?

00:48:04.603 --> 00:48:07.532
No drinks. Let's get a meal next time.

00:48:07.532 --> 00:48:09.633
Sounds great. A meal and drinks sound great.

00:48:09.633 --> 00:48:11.843
We can talk about our old days. That will be nice.

00:48:11.843 --> 00:48:13.813
- Okay. Roll it up. It's cold. - It will be nice.

00:48:13.813 --> 00:48:14.888
Sir.

00:48:15.913 --> 00:48:18.218
- Drive him home safely, please. - Sure.

00:48:40.103 --> 00:48:41.978
Don't drive me to Sagok-dong.

00:48:43.032 --> 00:48:44.678
Let's go to Namyeon-dong.

00:48:44.802 --> 00:48:46.248
Sure.

00:48:56.413 --> 00:48:58.097
Hello?

00:48:58.323 --> 00:49:00.827
Aren't you the owner of the vehicle with the plate number, 0731?

00:49:04.492 --> 00:49:05.698
I'm sorry.

00:49:16.272 --> 00:49:17.478
What?

00:49:17.873 --> 00:49:19.218
Why are you here?

00:49:22.313 --> 00:49:23.418
Sir.

00:49:25.613 --> 00:49:27.153
- Drive him home safely, please. - Sure.

00:49:27.153 --> 00:49:28.787
Don't drive me to Sagok-dong.

00:49:29.853 --> 00:49:31.252
Let's go to Namyeon-dong.

00:49:31.252 --> 00:49:32.653
Sure.

00:49:32.653 --> 00:49:34.627
(Namyeon-dong)

00:49:34.893 --> 00:49:37.797
Yes. I got it. Let me go out and check.

00:49:39.123 --> 00:49:41.633
Your Honor, don't worry.

00:49:41.633 --> 00:49:43.107
I'll be right behind you.

00:49:57.683 --> 00:50:00.042
You're under arrest for attempted murder.

00:50:00.042 --> 00:50:01.583
You have the right to consult an attorney.

00:50:01.583 --> 00:50:03.258
You have the right to refuse to answer questions.

00:50:03.853 --> 00:50:06.521
What? How did you know?

00:50:06.522 --> 00:50:07.728
How did you...

00:50:09.022 --> 00:50:10.428
Aren't you curious?

00:50:11.022 --> 00:50:12.998
The surgery will go well.

00:50:13.363 --> 00:50:15.567
Think long and hard about it for the rest of your life.

00:50:16.462 --> 00:50:18.063
Try to figure out how I knew it.

00:50:18.063 --> 00:50:20.547
What? What did you just say?

00:50:30.413 --> 00:50:31.517
Get in.

00:50:55.532 --> 00:50:57.047
You're making it up to me now.

00:50:57.073 --> 00:50:58.718
Be thankful that I am.

00:50:59.442 --> 00:51:01.287
You know that you're acting really strange today.

00:51:01.813 --> 00:51:03.587
Ahn Gyeong Nam. Oh Myung Chul.

00:51:03.613 --> 00:51:05.712
How did you know he would go to the judge?

00:51:05.712 --> 00:51:09.183
All you need to know is that I saved your life today.

00:51:09.183 --> 00:51:11.823
- Thank you. - To save your life,

00:51:11.823 --> 00:51:14.168
- I traveled through time... - You put me on the night shift.

00:51:14.853 --> 00:51:16.198
Is that what happened?

00:51:20.123 --> 00:51:22.933
It's nice to see you eat.

00:51:22.933 --> 00:51:24.208
Eat a lot.

00:51:25.063 --> 00:51:26.178
You.

00:51:27.673 --> 00:51:30.617
Was it called "Hidden Killer"? Stop reading that comic book.

00:51:30.643 --> 00:51:32.317
Right. The book signing.

00:51:32.573 --> 00:51:33.772
Gosh. It's all your fault!

00:51:33.772 --> 00:51:34.972
You're so weird.

00:51:34.972 --> 00:51:37.212
After traveling time and space, I still couldn't get it signed.

00:51:37.212 --> 00:51:38.413
Stop reading that. Seriously.

00:51:38.413 --> 00:51:41.512
It doesn't help your mental health grow at all.

00:51:41.512 --> 00:51:43.282
You're suddenly getting so annoying.

00:51:43.282 --> 00:51:46.583
Think carefully about this. You must take it seriously.

00:51:46.583 --> 00:51:48.228
Just eat up.

00:51:48.923 --> 00:51:50.297
There's no beer?

00:51:50.722 --> 00:51:52.863
You didn't buy me a beer when you bought me a fried chicken?

00:51:52.863 --> 00:51:55.433
- Just eat it. - They sell beer at restaurants.

00:51:55.433 --> 00:51:57.133
Wait, why didn't they give me Coke?

00:51:57.133 --> 00:51:58.508
Did you drink it?

00:51:58.802 --> 00:52:01.232
They always give Coke. This is unbelievable.

00:52:01.232 --> 00:52:02.448
What am I supposed to drink?

00:52:02.573 --> 00:52:04.248
Do I drink the ramyeon soup?

00:52:04.673 --> 00:52:06.017
Hey, have some ramyeon.

00:52:06.603 --> 00:52:08.017
Open the pickled radishes.

00:52:08.373 --> 00:52:10.148
Maybe, I shouldn't have done that.

00:52:10.173 --> 00:52:12.958
Goodness. I can't understand this.

00:52:13.482 --> 00:52:15.458
How could you only buy fried chicken?

00:52:23.192 --> 00:52:25.968
It doesn't take much to be happy, right, Maru?

00:52:28.262 --> 00:52:29.438
Maru!

00:52:33.702 --> 00:52:34.847
Maru!

00:52:36.002 --> 00:52:38.242
Maru. Aren't you Maru?

00:52:38.242 --> 00:52:40.347
Maru. I'm so sorry.

00:52:44.482 --> 00:52:46.517
Wait. Your legs...

00:52:52.022 --> 00:52:54.797
Wait, is Maru your dog?

00:52:56.353 --> 00:52:57.363
Maru...

00:52:57.363 --> 00:52:58.638
How do you know Maru?

00:53:01.262 --> 00:53:03.537
Didn't you lose Maru before the reset?

00:53:03.933 --> 00:53:07.107
Yes. But how did you know that?

00:53:07.202 --> 00:53:10.607
I was taking care of Maru because I couldn't find the owner.

00:53:10.843 --> 00:53:14.817
No leash or ID tag. The shelter said they'd let Maru go after 10 days.

00:53:15.042 --> 00:53:17.758
So Maru was living with me before the reset.

00:53:18.883 --> 00:53:21.087
I was at a hospital because of an accident.

00:53:21.313 --> 00:53:24.083
I was so worried in case something happened to Maru.

00:53:24.083 --> 00:53:26.597
I didn't starve Maru and regularly walked Maru.

00:53:26.623 --> 00:53:28.597
I never abused your dog. Isn't that right, Maru?

00:53:29.353 --> 00:53:30.627
Thank you.

00:53:31.093 --> 00:53:33.261
How did you know my dog's name is Maru?

00:53:33.262 --> 00:53:35.138
Right. That's so interesting.

00:53:36.333 --> 00:53:39.678
I just named the dog after a webtoon artist I like.

00:53:43.933 --> 00:53:45.178
Why did you laugh?

00:53:45.673 --> 00:53:47.418
- "Hidden Killer"? - Do you know the cartoon?

00:53:48.113 --> 00:53:49.388
I'm a huge fan.

00:53:50.012 --> 00:53:53.517
Did you know that the artist used her dog's name as her pen name?

00:53:53.583 --> 00:53:54.728
What?

00:53:55.383 --> 00:53:58.458
The webtoon artist. Her pen name, Maru.

00:54:02.153 --> 00:54:04.597
I'm Maru, the webtoon artist of "Hidden Killer".

00:54:07.863 --> 00:54:08.968
What?

00:54:09.292 --> 00:54:10.908
There you go.

00:54:12.563 --> 00:54:15.478
Let me see. That looks great on you.

00:54:15.702 --> 00:54:16.847
Maru, paw.

00:54:17.103 --> 00:54:18.547
That's it.

00:54:19.472 --> 00:54:21.843
Don't take it off for the time being even at home.

00:54:21.843 --> 00:54:24.017
Maru might run away out of the blue just like this.

00:54:24.343 --> 00:54:25.918
You don't have to buy this for Maru.

00:54:26.383 --> 00:54:28.458
You can just thank me for it.

00:54:29.452 --> 00:54:30.512
Thank you.

00:54:30.512 --> 00:54:31.928
Then,

00:54:32.982 --> 00:54:34.998
can you give me an autograph in exchange?

00:54:37.292 --> 00:54:39.663
I try not to meet my fans on a personal level.

00:54:39.663 --> 00:54:41.367
Bye. Let's go, Maru.

00:54:41.732 --> 00:54:42.807
What...

00:54:47.333 --> 00:54:49.603
Hey, you're not the one who reset your life.

00:54:49.603 --> 00:54:52.441
Why did you run to him as if you remember him?

00:54:52.442 --> 00:54:53.718
You embarrassed me.

00:54:54.942 --> 00:54:58.458
Maru, you can't go after strangers like that.

00:55:00.853 --> 00:55:03.057
Right. Oh, no. The vaccinations.

00:55:07.653 --> 00:55:08.827
Let's get them tomorrow.

00:55:11.923 --> 00:55:13.498
Woo Jin, why are you here at this hour?

00:55:30.212 --> 00:55:32.517
Didn't you take Maru to the vet?

00:55:38.183 --> 00:55:39.627
What's going on with you two?

00:55:41.722 --> 00:55:43.168
What did I just see?

00:55:50.433 --> 00:55:52.708
Ga Hyeon, hear me out.

00:56:14.423 --> 00:56:16.292
You know how tough...

00:56:16.292 --> 00:56:18.767
things are for him and how much he's trying.

00:56:47.522 --> 00:56:48.898
I'll listen to your story.

00:56:49.153 --> 00:56:51.337
I know it's lame, but I must know.

00:56:54.163 --> 00:56:55.567
When did it start?

00:56:58.002 --> 00:56:59.138
This affair between you two.

00:57:02.833 --> 00:57:04.918
Were you going to see her even when we are married?

00:57:07.742 --> 00:57:08.817
What about you?

00:57:09.613 --> 00:57:11.758
Were you going to let him marry me?

00:57:13.242 --> 00:57:15.758
- I'm sorry. - "I'm sorry" doesn't cut it.

00:57:15.853 --> 00:57:18.198
You just trashed our friendship of 10 years and you're sorry?

00:57:18.323 --> 00:57:19.428
It's all my fault.

00:57:20.722 --> 00:57:22.297
Ju Young didn't do anything wrong.

00:57:31.502 --> 00:57:32.837
I'm grateful to you both.

00:57:36.103 --> 00:57:38.478
I reflected on myself because I thought...

00:57:39.502 --> 00:57:41.218
I was the only nasty one.

00:57:42.942 --> 00:57:44.787
But it turns out I didn't have to do that.

00:57:48.512 --> 00:57:51.898
Mr. Han Woo Jin, starting today, you won't be managing my webtoon.

00:57:52.323 --> 00:57:53.923
You talk to the company.

00:57:53.923 --> 00:57:56.297
Tell them that I fired you because you cheated on me,

00:57:56.323 --> 00:57:57.597
so I feel uncomfortable working with you.

00:57:58.093 --> 00:57:59.337
The same goes for you too.

00:58:00.292 --> 00:58:01.438
Starting today,

00:58:01.992 --> 00:58:03.438
we're not friends anymore.

00:58:05.002 --> 00:58:08.908
As you're not my friend, please get out of my house.

00:58:10.173 --> 00:58:11.347
Ga Hyeon.

00:58:17.683 --> 00:58:18.918
I hope...

00:58:20.643 --> 00:58:22.557
you guys stay together to the end.

00:58:26.252 --> 00:58:27.767
If you stay together,

00:58:28.722 --> 00:58:30.498
you'll always be reminded of me.

00:58:32.923 --> 00:58:36.537
Stay together with a memory that makes you feel ashamed...

00:58:38.032 --> 00:58:39.577
and make your relationship uncomfortable.

01:00:16.893 --> 01:00:19.408
(Jian Clinic, snooze)

01:00:26.343 --> 01:00:28.218
(Jian Clinic, January 18, Friday)

01:00:38.683 --> 01:00:39.898
Ga Hyeon.

01:00:40.323 --> 01:00:41.698
Ga Hyeon.

01:00:43.022 --> 01:00:44.522
You didn't upload your webtoon yesterday,

01:00:44.522 --> 01:00:46.797
but of course, I know how it goes.

01:00:47.123 --> 01:00:49.532
Before the reset, Ji Han was about to expose...

01:00:49.532 --> 01:00:50.708
the identity of the man.

01:00:50.732 --> 01:00:51.802
That's how far I got.

01:00:51.802 --> 01:00:55.232
But after the reset, Ji Han is still fighting with Hades.

01:00:55.232 --> 01:00:57.332
What on earth is the man's identity?

01:00:57.333 --> 01:00:59.702
That brings me to my point. Before we go in,

01:00:59.702 --> 01:01:02.017
can you tell me about the identity?

01:01:06.512 --> 01:01:07.827
Did something happen?

01:01:44.683 --> 01:01:46.228
- My gosh. - Gosh.

01:01:46.423 --> 01:01:47.797
No way!

01:01:51.923 --> 01:01:53.337
My goodness.

01:01:53.762 --> 01:01:55.037
You leveled up.

01:02:25.563 --> 01:02:26.797
Hello, ma'am.

01:02:27.262 --> 01:02:29.008
We're really back.

01:02:29.032 --> 01:02:31.501
I wasn't sure. I was quite anxious, to be honest.

01:02:31.502 --> 01:02:32.933
I'll believe you...

01:02:32.933 --> 01:02:35.607
if you tell me we can make soybean blocks with red beans.

01:02:35.633 --> 01:02:38.347
Thank you so much.

01:02:40.942 --> 01:02:42.817
It's our first time meeting this life.

01:02:50.813 --> 01:02:52.658
Everyone seems happy.

01:02:54.052 --> 01:02:57.067
By the way, one of us hasn't arrived yet.

01:02:57.793 --> 01:03:01.023
Right. This guy was going to buy lottery tickets just like me.

01:03:01.023 --> 01:03:03.468
- He was... He was a deliveryman. - Yes.

01:03:03.693 --> 01:03:04.777
Right.

01:03:05.333 --> 01:03:08.908
He cannot make it here today.

01:03:09.132 --> 01:03:10.408
Pardon?

01:03:12.273 --> 01:03:13.647
I am truly sorry...

01:03:14.643 --> 01:03:16.948
that I must deliver sad news as soon as...

01:03:18.043 --> 01:03:19.388
you reset your lives.

01:03:28.793 --> 01:03:31.127
Mr. Park Young Gil who couldn't make it here today...

01:03:35.632 --> 01:03:37.038
is dead.

01:04:04.793 --> 01:04:06.797
(We thank Yu Gun and Jeon Seok Ho for their special appearances.)

01:04:14.262 --> 01:04:15.833
(365: Repeat the Year)

01:04:15.833 --> 01:04:17.678
It was all a lie. Everything was.

01:04:17.733 --> 01:04:19.477
We could have been in danger too.

01:04:19.802 --> 01:04:22.313
Let me go back. No, I must go back.

01:04:22.313 --> 01:04:23.672
Hold on. Where are you?

01:04:23.672 --> 01:04:25.043
You knew everything from the start, didn't you?

01:04:25.043 --> 01:04:26.642
Before that. This is the last one.

01:04:26.643 --> 01:04:28.512
I know. I can help you.

01:04:28.512 --> 01:04:30.483
We were invited to the Death Note Game.

01:04:30.483 --> 01:04:33.222
I won't be fooled like the last time.

01:04:33.222 --> 01:04:36.297
If you want to bring it back, survive no matter what.
