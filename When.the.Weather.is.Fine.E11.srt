<b>I gave you that name.</b>

169
00:13:07,103 --> 00:13:10,200
<b>I guess your dad never told you.</b>

<b>I'm very ill.</b>

174

<b>So...</b>

175
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:33,255
<b>I'd like you to visit me.</b>

176

181
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:24,335
<b>So? Did you meet her?</b>

<b>No.</b>

183

<b>I felt like...</b>

187
00:14:40,696 --> 00:14:44,795
<b>I'd be betraying my parents if I went there to see her.</b>

188
00:14:52,742 --> 00:14:54,365
<b>Also,</b>

189
00:14:55,611 --> 00:14:58,205
<b>I saw you on the platform that day.</b>

190
00:15:08,224 --> 00:15:09,785
<b>What?</b>

191
00:15:09,926 --> 00:15:11,555
<b>Nothing.</b>

192
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,095
<b>Enjoy.</b>

193
00:15:26,042 --> 00:15:29,275
<b>Shouldn't servers wear masks these days?</b>

<b>Drinking in broad daylight?</b>

195
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,745
<b>Yes, I have a reason to drink.</b>

196
00:15:36,152 --> 00:15:40,415
<b>I heard you signed a contract with Shim Myeong Yeo.</b>

197

<b>Yes.</b>

198
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:44,290

199
00:15:44,293 --> 00:15:46,360
<b>Annul it.</b>

200
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,455

<b>No, I'm good.</b>

202
00:15:53,002 --> 00:15:54,200
<b>Why don't you like it?</b>

203
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:56,870
<b>You two were in a relationship.</b>

<b>For 20 years.</b>

<b>We could have talked on the phone.</b>

<b>- We can see each other again. - Okay, I'll see you later.</b>

321
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,525
<b>Okay.</b>

322
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:47,529
<b>- Have a good day. - Goodbye.</b>

323
00:25:55,737 --> 00:25:58,640
<b>Well, well. Hello there, my friend.</b>

324
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,109
<b>My friend who is older than me.</b>

325
00:26:01,109 --> 00:26:04,212
<b>- What? - What were you doing just now?</b>

326
00:26:04,212 --> 00:26:05,280
<b>What do you mean? Why?</b>

327
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,416
<b>I knew you'd deny it.</b>

328
00:26:07,416 --> 00:26:09,751
<b>What? Deny what?</b>

329
00:26:10,352 --> 00:26:13,322
<b>Will you still deny it after seeing this?</b>

330
00:26:13,322 --> 00:26:14,923
<b>Say something, my friend.</b>

331
00:26:14,923 --> 00:26:17,759
<b>My friend who is much older than me.</b>

332
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:19,561
<b>Well, Hwi...</b>

333
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:21,396
<b>I was just briefly saying hi.</b>

334
00:26:21,396 --> 00:26:23,599
<b>- Is that so? - Yes.</b>

335
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:25,334
<b>I bumped into an old friend of mine.</b>

336
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:28,971
<b>Oh, so if you bump into an old friend on the street,</b>

337
00:26:28,971 --> 00:26:31,206
<b>you smile warmly with a bashful look...</b>

338
00:26:31,206 --> 00:26:32,874
<b>and shake their hand?</b>

339
00:26:32,874 --> 00:26:36,178
<b>Jang Woo, I didn't know that about you.</b>

340
00:26:36,912 --> 00:26:39,047
<b>Just give me that.</b>

341
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,151
<b>How...</b>

342
00:26:43,151 --> 00:26:46,254
<b>How could you be so mean?</b>

343
00:26:46,254 --> 00:26:48,457
<b>You're not like your brother at all.</b>

344
00:26:48,457 --> 00:26:49,958
<b>You're quick to catch on.</b>

345
00:26:49,958 --> 00:26:52,694
<b>Unlike Eun Seop, you know.</b>

346
00:26:56,098 --> 00:26:58,133
<b>Come on, my friend.</b>

347
00:26:58,133 --> 00:27:00,435
<b>I even pay 10 dollars for information...</b>

348
00:27:00,435 --> 00:27:03,005
<b>Kwon Hyun Ji brings me.</b>

349
00:27:03,972 --> 00:27:06,108
<b>Goodness, seriously.</b>

350
00:27:12,347 --> 00:27:15,117
<b>Gosh, Jang Woo. I was just asking for 10 bucks.</b>

351
00:27:15,117 --> 00:27:16,218
<b>Thank you!</b>

352
00:27:16,218 --> 00:27:19,488
<b>Thank you, and I'll treat you like my brother for the next few days.</b>

353
00:27:19,488 --> 00:27:21,423
<b>That's gross, so just call me Jang Woo.</b>

354
00:27:21,423 --> 00:27:23,291
<b>Really? Send!</b>

355
00:27:23,291 --> 00:27:25,394
<b>No, don't send it...</b>

356
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:28,363
<b>I'll be really grateful if you delete that.</b>

357
00:27:28,363 --> 00:27:31,133
<b>Shall I delete it then?</b>

358
00:27:31,133 --> 00:27:32,567
<b>How could you...</b>

359
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:33,702
<b>Why aren't you at school?</b>

360
00:27:33,702 --> 00:27:35,637
<b>It's lunchtime, so I'm taking a stroll.</b>

361
00:27:35,637 --> 00:27:37,706
<b>You should be in the cafeteria eating lunch then.</b>

362
00:27:37,706 --> 00:27:39,541
<b>Come on, you weren't eating at work either...</b>

363
00:27:39,541 --> 00:27:41,743
<b>and wearing that goofy smile over here.</b>

364
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:43,345
<b>That's because I came here briefly for lunch...</b>

365
00:27:43,345 --> 00:27:44,713
<b>So you know it's the same thing, my friend.</b>

366
00:27:44,713 --> 00:27:47,716
<b>My friend who is much older than me.</b>

367
00:27:47,716 --> 00:27:49,685
<b>Well, I should get going since I'm busy.</b>

368
00:27:49,685 --> 00:27:51,319
<b>Take care, my friend. Bye.</b>

369
00:27:51,319 --> 00:27:53,989
<b>Hurry up and go. Get going.</b>

370
00:28:00,696 --> 00:28:02,297
<b>Didn't you...</b>

371
00:28:02,464 --> 00:28:04,299
<b>just tell me to go?</b>

372
00:28:04,299 --> 00:28:08,336
<b>Oh, I was telling you to drop me off at school and go.</b>

373
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:11,173
<b>Jang Woo, I'm in a hurry, so let's go.</b>

374
00:28:11,173 --> 00:28:14,342
<b>My lunchtime is almost over. Or maybe it's already over.</b>

375
00:28:14,342 --> 00:28:16,011
<b>Do you want to see me receive penalty points?</b>

376
00:28:16,011 --> 00:28:17,846
<b>Do you know how many penalty points I received lately...</b>

377
00:28:17,846 --> 00:28:19,548
<b>because of Eun Seop's "The Catcher in the Rye"?</b>

378
00:28:19,548 --> 00:28:21,149
<b>Let's go then.</b>

379
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,886
<b>I don't have much time either.</b>

380
00:28:24,886 --> 00:28:26,888
<b>Let's go, my friend.</b>

381
00:28:26,888 --> 00:28:28,590
<b>Hwi, why are you so heavy?</b>

382
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:30,625
<b>Just keep pedaling, my friend.</b>

383
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:33,495
<b>Why do you have such weak legs for a man?</b>

384
00:28:40,936 --> 00:28:43,138
<b>You know that day...</b>

385
00:28:44,206 --> 00:28:45,874
<b>The day...</b>

386
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:49,611
<b>when I got on the Mugunghwa train.</b>

387
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:01,623
<b>I really wanted to die that day.</b>

388
00:29:05,761 --> 00:29:08,563
<b>That's how I felt back then.</b>

389
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,142
<b>(A murderer's daughter sits here.)</b>

390
00:29:20,142 --> 00:29:22,177
<b>Waking up in the morning and going to school...</b>

391
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:24,379
<b>felt so miserable back then.</b>

392
00:29:24,379 --> 00:29:25,914
<b>- Hey. - Come on.</b>

393
00:29:25,914 --> 00:29:28,950
<b>I was pondering how I should die...</b>

394
00:29:32,454 --> 00:29:34,022
<b>And then...</b>

395
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:36,591
<b>I decided to go to a station near a river.</b>

396
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:39,795
<b>I was going to go there and die.</b>

397
00:30:06,154 --> 00:30:07,455
<b>But...</b>

398
00:30:07,455 --> 00:30:10,792
<b>it felt like I wouldn't die if I just walked in.</b>

399
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,729
<b>I was thinking if I should put some rocks...</b>

400
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:17,599
<b>inside my pockets.</b>

401
00:30:19,701 --> 00:30:22,003
<b>But I suddenly felt so hungry.</b>

402
00:30:25,207 --> 00:30:29,811
<b>Fine. Then shall I eat one last meal before dying?</b>

403
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:35,343
<b>But after I finished eating,</b>

404
00:31:35,343 --> 00:31:37,012
<b>I felt sleepy.</b>

405
00:31:55,897 --> 00:31:58,633
<b>Then shall I take a quick nap?</b>

406
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:24,159
<b>The whole day went by like that...</b>

407
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:26,394
<b>and something came to mind.</b>

408
00:32:27,762 --> 00:32:32,200
<b>Right, I'll never die at this rate.</b>

409
00:32:35,804 --> 00:32:37,439
<b>No.</b>

410
00:32:37,939 --> 00:32:40,175
<b>I must die.</b>

411
00:32:45,347 --> 00:32:47,749
<b>I must die. I'll die...</b>

412
00:32:47,916 --> 00:32:51,987
<b>and make everyone who bullied me regret it.</b>

413
00:33:26,287 --> 00:33:28,523
<b>Hey, Mok Hae Won!</b>

414
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:30,625
<b>Mok Hae Won!</b>

415
00:33:30,625 --> 00:33:32,794
<b>Come back!</b>

416
00:33:34,062 --> 00:33:35,764
<b>Mok Hae Won!</b>

417
00:33:37,866 --> 00:33:39,534
<b>Mok Hae Won!</b>

418
00:33:40,502 --> 00:33:42,203
<b>Ouch, that hurts.</b>

419
00:33:42,203 --> 00:33:43,405
<b>Hey, Mok Hae Won!</b>

420
00:33:43,405 --> 00:33:46,708
<b>You brat! Hey, Mok Hae Won!</b>

421
00:33:46,708 --> 00:33:48,343
<b>How did...</b>

422
00:33:50,078 --> 00:33:51,346
<b>Mok Hae Won.</b>

423
00:33:51,346 --> 00:33:53,581
<b>It still puzzles me.</b>

424
00:33:53,915 --> 00:33:57,318
<b>How did my aunt know I was there?</b>

425
00:33:59,687 --> 00:34:02,223
<b>Is that why you decided not to die?</b>

426
00:34:02,223 --> 00:34:03,792
<b>Yes.</b>

427
00:34:10,198 --> 00:34:12,400
<b>If you want to die,</b>

428
00:34:15,537 --> 00:34:17,906
<b>I will die with you.</b>

429
00:34:21,209 --> 00:34:22,944
<b>What are you saying?</b>

430
00:34:25,747 --> 00:34:28,049
<b>Let's die together. My mom is dead too anyway.</b>

431
00:34:28,049 --> 00:34:30,185
<b>Come on, seriously.</b>

432
00:34:31,186 --> 00:34:34,189
<b>Why? Are you scared?</b>

433
00:34:44,232 --> 00:34:48,336
<b>The thought of wanting to die suddenly vanished.</b>

434
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:52,273
<b>It felt like...</b>

435
00:34:52,273 --> 00:34:55,910
<b>my aunt would keep nagging me even when I was dying.</b>

436
00:35:00,915 --> 00:35:03,084
<b>I'm glad you lived.</b>

437
00:35:08,823 --> 00:35:13,027
<b>Thank you for not dying, Hae Won.</b>

438
00:35:20,969 --> 00:35:22,770
<b>Tell me.</b>

439
00:35:26,407 --> 00:35:28,343
<b>Tell me, Eun Seop.</b>

440
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,778
<b>Tell you what?</b>

441
00:35:31,646 --> 00:35:33,448
<b>About us.</b>

442
00:35:39,454 --> 00:35:41,156
<b>Is this love?</b>

443
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:50,865
<b>I want to hear your answer.</b>

444
00:35:52,367 --> 00:35:54,135
<b>Is this love?</b>

445
00:35:57,005 --> 00:35:58,573
<b>Yes.</b>

446
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:01,576
<b>It is love.</b>

447
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:08,483
<b>I feel the same way.</b>

448
00:36:31,339 --> 00:36:35,877
<b>(Hodu House)</b>

449
00:36:46,321 --> 00:36:49,157
<b>Gosh, you scared me.</b>

450
00:36:50,191 --> 00:36:51,759
<b>What's up?</b>

451
00:36:52,493 --> 00:36:55,964
<b>Hey, how much of the novel have you written so far?</b>

452
00:36:56,731 --> 00:36:57,865
<b>What is this about?</b>

453
00:36:57,865 --> 00:36:59,734
<b>How much have you written so far?</b>

454
00:36:59,734 --> 00:37:02,270
<b>Look, mister.</b>

455
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:04,505
<b>It hasn't even been three days yet.</b>

456
00:37:04,505 --> 00:37:07,508
<b>Hey, what kind of crazy chief editor...</b>

457
00:37:07,508 --> 00:37:09,510
<b>shows up at an author's place and harasses her...</b>

458
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:11,412
<b>just a couple of days after signing a contract with her?</b>

459
00:37:11,412 --> 00:37:13,047
<b>Are you losing your mind?</b>

460
00:37:13,047 --> 00:37:14,649
<b>You must have the opening sentence figured out.</b>

461
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:16,818
<b>Oh, the opening sentence?</b>

462
00:37:16,818 --> 00:37:18,052
<b>You have it, right?</b>

463
00:37:18,052 --> 00:37:21,356
<b>The opening sentence... I did write something.</b>

464
00:37:21,356 --> 00:37:23,791
<b>Don't tell me you came all the way here to talk to me about that.</b>

465
00:37:23,791 --> 00:37:27,061
<b>I sure did. I came all the way here to talk to you about it.</b>

466

<b>You must have a lot of time on your hands, Crybaby.</b>

<b>My editors do all the work. All I do is sign things off,</b>

468
00:37:32,033 --> 00:37:34,502
<b>so I don't have much to do. You know?</b>

469
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:37,071
<b>Really? That's great.</b>

470
00:37:37,071 --> 00:37:38,640
<b>What do you mean?</b>

471
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,908
<b>You know Sun Yeong, right?</b>

472
00:37:40,908 --> 00:37:42,744
<b>Yes, Choi Sun Yeong?</b>

473
00:37:42,744 --> 00:37:44,979
<b>Right, she's dying.</b>

474
00:37:44,979 --> 00:37:46,114
<b>What?</b>

00:37:46,114 --> 00:37:47,482
<b>She has metastatic breast cancer.</b>

476
00:37:47,482 --> 00:37:49,617
<b>It has spread all over, so she can't even get chemotherapy.</b>

477
00:37:49,617 --> 00:37:51,519
<b>She has less than a month left to live.</b>

478
00:37:52,487 --> 00:37:54,789
<b>Hey, you're talking as if she's a complete stranger to you.</b>

479
00:37:54,789 --> 00:37:56,257
<b>I'm not the one going through it.</b>

480
00:37:56,257 --> 00:37:58,092
<b>She was living in Seoul, but she wanted to die here,</b>

481
00:37:58,092 --> 00:38:00,361
<b>so she's at the university hospital now.</b>

482
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:01,663
<b>I have to go see her.</b>

483
00:38:01,663 --> 00:38:03,398
<b>Give me a ride to the hospital.</b>

484
00:38:03,398 --> 00:38:05,566
<b>Come on. Unlock the door.</b>

485
00:38:06,834 --> 00:38:08,303
<b>Hey.</b>

486
00:38:08,303 --> 00:38:10,405
<b>I'm tired because I drove all the way here.</b>

487
00:38:10,405 --> 00:38:11,873
<b>Can't you drive?</b>

488
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:14,309
<b>No, I can't. I don't drive.</b>

489
00:38:14,309 --> 00:38:16,311
<b>Why not? You used to be a good driver.</b>

490
00:38:16,311 --> 00:38:18,813
<b>Nonsense. Anyway, let's go.</b>

491
00:38:22,917 --> 00:38:25,153
<b>My gosh, this is what happens when I'm not around?</b>

492
00:38:25,153 --> 00:38:26,254
<b>- It's huge. - Oh, my.</b>

493
00:38:26,254 --> 00:38:27,822
<b>Look.</b>

494
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:29,290
<b>Hey.</b>

495
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:31,192
<b>Look at this one going bald.</b>

496
00:38:31,459 --> 00:38:33,628
<b>I almost didn't recognize him.</b>

497
00:38:34,696 --> 00:38:36,464
<b>- What? - My gosh!</b>

498
00:38:36,464 --> 00:38:38,199
<b>- Look who's here! - Cha Yun Taek!</b>

499
00:38:38,199 --> 00:38:39,600
<b>Hi, Sun Yeong.</b>

500
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,703
<b>Hey, she likes peaches.</b>

501
00:38:41,703 --> 00:38:43,271
<b>Really?</b>

502
00:38:44,772 --> 00:38:46,774
<b>- What? - Well, you know.</b>

503
00:38:46,774 --> 00:38:48,976
<b>You two look quite lovely together.</b>

504
00:38:48,976 --> 00:38:51,879
<b>- What are you saying? - Oh, that's expensive.</b>

505
00:38:54,282 --> 00:38:56,718
<b>- Hey. - What?</b>

506
00:38:57,852 --> 00:38:59,420
<b>What's up?</b>

507
00:38:59,554 --> 00:39:01,122
<b>I heard your family has a bookstore.</b>

508
00:39:01,122 --> 00:39:03,925
<b>Yes. By the way, I got a new saddle for my bike.</b>

509
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:05,560
<b>I'm so fast now.</b>

510
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,729
<b>If you see me riding my bike, you'll be very surprised.</b>

511
00:39:07,729 --> 00:39:09,497
<b>Hey, hold on.</b>

512
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:14,168
<b>I want to go there.</b>

513
00:39:14,168 --> 00:39:16,104
<b>- Gosh, this is... - I actually know where it is,</b>

514
00:39:16,104 --> 00:39:17,939
<b>- It's awesome. - but I don't want to go alone.</b>

515
00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:19,841
<b>And more importantly...</b>

516
00:39:21,509 --> 00:39:23,277
<b>Did you hear what I said?</b>

517
00:39:23,411 --> 00:39:24,979
<b>What?</b>

518
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:32,887
<b>I want to check out your family's bookstore.</b>

519
00:39:32,887 --> 00:39:34,088
<b>I actually...</b>

520
00:39:34,088 --> 00:39:36,557
<b>So? What is it? What have you got for me?</b>

521
00:39:37,325 --> 00:39:39,627
<b>Young Soo likes books.</b>

522
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:41,195
<b>What?</b>

523
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:48,503
<b>I heard there's a book club.</b>

524
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:52,840
<b>What's with you?</b>

525
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:55,076
<b>No, you can't come.</b>

526
00:39:59,247 --> 00:40:02,083
<b>Don't come. If you come, you're dead.</b>

527
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:12,627
<b>Actually, you can come.</b>

528
00:40:12,794 --> 00:40:15,830
<b>- What? - As long as you keep...</b>

529
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,933
<b>your end of the bargain.</b>

530
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:30,545
<b>You must be tired.</b>

531
00:40:30,578 --> 00:40:31,813
<b>A little.</b>

532
00:40:31,813 --> 00:40:33,514
<b>Go upstairs and get some rest.</b>

533
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:35,450
<b>I'll stay here.</b>

534
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:36,484
<b>No, it's okay.</b>

535
00:40:36,484 --> 00:40:39,187
<b>Go on. You must be exhausted from all the driving.</b>

536
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:40,755
<b>Get some sleep.</b>

537
00:40:41,255 --> 00:40:42,824
<b>All right.</b>

538
00:40:48,262 --> 00:40:50,431
<b>- Go on. - Okay.</b>

539
00:40:54,936 --> 00:40:56,037
<b>What?</b>

540
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:59,006
<b>I have to do something. There are so many books here.</b>

541
00:40:59,807 --> 00:41:02,176
<b>I need to organize these.</b>

542
00:41:02,677 --> 00:41:04,312
<b>Let's see.</b>

543
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:17,558
<b>What?</b>

544
00:41:18,025 --> 00:41:19,594
<b>Nothing.</b>

545
00:41:21,429 --> 00:41:22,763
<b>Hey, Eun Seop.</b>

546
00:41:22,763 --> 00:41:24,332
<b>Yes.</b>

547
00:41:24,699 --> 00:41:26,834
<b>I want to sleep with you.</b>

548
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:37,478
<b>What did you say?</b>

549
00:41:37,478 --> 00:41:39,780
<b>I said I want to sleep with you.</b>

550
00:41:44,318 --> 00:41:45,887
<b>Well...</b>

551
00:42:04,839 --> 00:42:06,407
<b>Then I'll...</b>

552
00:42:14,415 --> 00:42:16,050
<b>Well...</b>

553
00:42:16,918 --> 00:42:18,686
<b>Is this what I'm supposed to do?</b>

554
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:20,788
<b>Yes.</b>

555
00:43:14,275 --> 00:43:16,510
<b>If this is love,</b>

556
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:23,317
<b>I wish you could tell me.</b>

557
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:29,857
<b>Tell me not to leave.</b>

558
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:38,499
<b>Ask me to stay by your side forever...</b>

559
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:42,903
<b>like the perpetual snow that never melts.</b>

560
00:43:50,645 --> 00:43:53,180
<b>- Hey, Yun Taek. - Yes?</b>

561
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:55,483
<b>You're so good-looking now.</b>

562
00:43:55,483 --> 00:43:57,385
<b>Gosh.</b>

563
00:43:57,385 --> 00:43:59,754
<b>Did I look that lame back in the old days?</b>

564
00:43:59,754 --> 00:44:01,222
<b>Yes.</b>

565
00:44:01,222 --> 00:44:02,823
<b>Why ask? You know the answer, Crybaby.</b>

566
00:44:02,823 --> 00:44:04,592
<b>- "Crybaby". - "Crybaby".</b>

567
00:44:04,592 --> 00:44:06,260
<b>Okay, fine.</b>

568
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:07,728
<b>Bye, guys.</b>

569
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:09,730
<b>We won't walk you out.</b>

570
00:44:11,632 --> 00:44:14,168
<b>I'll see you again soon, Sun Yeong.</b>

571
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:17,571
<b>It was nice seeing you.</b>

572
00:44:23,878 --> 00:44:26,180
<b>- By the way... - Yes?</b>

573
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:28,382
<b>It's been bothering me.</b>

574
00:44:28,382 --> 00:44:31,252
<b>What are those bruises on your face?</b>

575
00:44:31,318 --> 00:44:32,887
<b>What?</b>

576
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:35,322
<b>Do you get shots on your face too?</b>

577
00:44:35,322 --> 00:44:38,092
<b>Why is your face bruised?</b>

578
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:40,428
<b>Oh, these?</b>

579
00:44:40,428 --> 00:44:42,496
<b>I bumped into a wall.</b>

580
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:45,399
<b>Right, Su Jeong?</b>

581
00:44:45,633 --> 00:44:47,535
<b>Yes, that's right.</b>

582
00:44:47,535 --> 00:44:50,738
<b>I was pushing her wheelchair the other day, and... Right?</b>

583
00:44:50,738 --> 00:44:51,739
<b>It was an accident.</b>

584
00:44:51,739 --> 00:44:55,776
<b>I bumped only slightly, but I ended up with all these bruises.</b>

585
00:44:57,411 --> 00:44:59,880
<b>It's true.</b>

586
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:23,771
<b>Choi Sun Yeong.</b>

587
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:27,875
<b>Does her husband still hit her?</b>

588
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:29,810
<b>She's dying.</b>

589
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:33,481
<b>Why doesn't she divorce that jerk? What's holding her back?</b>

590
00:45:33,581 --> 00:45:35,683
<b>I really don't understand.</b>

591
00:45:35,683 --> 00:45:37,284
<b>Could this be...</b>

592
00:45:37,284 --> 00:45:40,020
<b>what she thinks?</b>

593
00:45:40,755 --> 00:45:44,325
<b>Since her husband doesn't hit her all the time,</b>

594
00:45:44,425 --> 00:45:47,094
<b>- she just puts up with him. - What?</b>

595
00:45:47,094 --> 00:45:50,297
<b>Honey, look at this.</b>

596
00:45:50,531 --> 00:45:51,599
<b>What do you think?</b>

597
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:54,235
<b>When he's not hitting her...</b>

598
00:45:54,235 --> 00:45:55,936
<b>It's pretty.</b>

599
00:45:56,203 --> 00:45:58,105
<b>Right?</b>

600
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:02,743
<b>- Where's Hae Won? - She'll be here soon.</b>

601
00:46:02,743 --> 00:46:04,779
<b>I prepared bulgogi for Hae Won...</b>

602
00:46:04,779 --> 00:46:07,915
<b>and rice balls for you.</b>

603
00:46:10,885 --> 00:46:13,420
<b>I hope this is enough.</b>

604
00:46:13,888 --> 00:46:16,590
<b>Maybe I should have prepared more.</b>

605
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:18,459
<b>It'll be fine.</b>

606
00:46:18,459 --> 00:46:20,060
<b>Okay.</b>

607
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:24,832
<b>He might be the sweetest and warmest person there is.</b>

608
00:46:28,569 --> 00:46:30,171
<b>What?</b>

609
00:46:30,938 --> 00:46:32,273
<b>Why would you get so upset?</b>

610
00:46:32,273 --> 00:46:33,707
<b>You don't remember what you said earlier?</b>

611
00:46:33,707 --> 00:46:36,477
<b>It wasn't meant for you!</b>

612
00:46:36,944 --> 00:46:39,046
<b>You little...</b>

613
00:46:40,915 --> 00:46:42,383
<b>"Yes."</b>

614
00:46:42,383 --> 00:46:46,420
<b>"It's just that he lost his temper for a moment."</b>

615
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:50,391
<b>Honey, I'm really sorry.</b>

616
00:46:51,258 --> 00:46:54,428
<b>I must have been out of my mind. Gosh.</b>

617
00:46:54,428 --> 00:46:56,130
<b>Honey, forgive me this once.</b>

618
00:46:56,130 --> 00:46:58,632
<b>It'll never happen again.</b>

619
00:46:58,632 --> 00:47:00,301
<b>I'm so sorry, Myeong Ju.</b>

620
00:47:00,301 --> 00:47:03,537
<b>"Look how desperately he begs for forgiveness."</b>

621
00:47:03,838 --> 00:47:08,242
<b>She must tell herself that and keep forgiving him.</b>

622
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:10,544
<b>She holds on to false hope.</b>

623
00:47:10,544 --> 00:47:12,847
<b>In the end, he breaks his promise.</b>

624
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:14,982
<b>He goes back on his word and hits her again.</b>

625
00:47:14,982 --> 00:47:16,684
<b>He lost his temper for a moment?</b>

626
00:47:16,684 --> 00:47:18,953
<b>Anyone can get angry, but they hold back.</b>

627
00:47:18,953 --> 00:47:22,389
<b>If he can't hold back his anger, why should she put up with him?</b>

628
00:47:22,723 --> 00:47:24,558
<b>You're right.</b>

629
00:47:24,558 --> 00:47:26,994
<b>Even if he only hits her occasionally, he still hits her.</b>

630
00:47:26,994 --> 00:47:29,263
<b>He's a warm person?</b>

631
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:31,065
<b>Does that make sense?</b>

632
00:47:31,065 --> 00:47:33,234
<b>No, it doesn't.</b>

633
00:47:33,234 --> 00:47:35,436
<b>How could she...</b>

634
00:47:37,438 --> 00:47:39,707

01:00:30,744 --> 01:00:35,849
<b>(Wasn't your father a vagrant?)</b>

794
01:00:35,849 --> 01:00:40,954
<b>(Do I have to live a miserable and sad life as they want me to?)</b>

795
01:00:40,954 --> 01:00:45,558
<b>(I thought about it long and hard, and the answer was no.)</b>

796
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:48,061
<b>(I realized there's no reason to be miserable...)</b>

797
01:00:48,061 --> 01:00:50,764
<b>(when I feel grateful to so many people.)</b>

798

<b>(When the Weather is Fine)</b>

800
01:01:01,875 --> 01:01:04,411
<b>I'm sleepy. I want to keep looking at you.</b>

801
01:01:04,411 --> 01:01:07,514
<b>- Ji Eun Sil? - I want to ask you something.</b>

802
01:01:07,514 --> 01:01:08,615
<b>Can I?</b>

803
01:01:08,615 --> 01:01:10,850
<b>He's a new member of our book club.</b>

804
01:01:10,850 --> 01:01:12,218
<b>Let's give him a big hand!</b>

805
01:01:12,218 --> 01:01:13,753
<b>What is this? Explain.</b>

806
01:01:13,753 --> 01:01:15,989
<b>I mean the fax you sent me last night!</b>

807
01:01:15,989 --> 01:01:17,590
<b>Did you come to return that?</b>

808
01:01:17,590 --> 01:01:20,393
<b>It's just an excuse. To be honest, I liked you.</b>

809
01:01:20,393 --> 01:01:22,095
<b>I liked you first.</b>

810
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:23,530
<b>For a very long time.</b>

811
01:01:23,530 --> 01:01:24,831
<b>I'm in trouble now.</b>

812
01:01:24,831 --> 01:01:29,536
<b>I don't think I'll forget this for the rest of my life.</b>
