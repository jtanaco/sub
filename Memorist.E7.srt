<b>Were the murders 20 years ago also an offering to your deity?</b>

161
00:16:40,926 --> 00:16:42,795
<b>Is that what you're talking about?</b>

162
00:16:44,256 --> 00:16:45,426
<b>The Executioner?</b>

163
00:16:50,035 --> 00:16:51,095
<b>The Executioner?</b>

164
00:16:53,135 --> 00:16:55,835
<b>Don't ask. Don't let him take the lead.</b>

165
00:16:56,436 --> 00:16:57,706
<b>How do you know about the Executioner?</b>

166
00:16:57,936 --> 00:16:59,746
<b>Don't you live with that strange feeling,</b>

167
00:17:00,446 --> 00:17:03,875
<b>knowing the truth is laid out everywhere, but only you know it.</b>

168
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:06,416
<b>At times, it's pride, but sometimes, it's loneliness.</b>

169
00:17:06,785 --> 00:17:09,885
<b>That endlessly strange and lonely feeling.</b>

170
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:13,785
<b>Can you scan memories too?</b>

171
00:17:14,885 --> 00:17:16,256
<b>No, I'm not.</b>

172
00:17:16,456 --> 00:17:18,395
<b>I don't have telepathy like you.</b>

173
00:17:18,966 --> 00:17:20,166
<b>You're a shaman?</b>

174
00:17:20,865 --> 00:17:24,135
<b>I can peek into the truth a little.</b>

175
00:17:26,436 --> 00:17:30,176
<b>I was able to hear the deity through long prayer and penance.</b>

176
00:17:31,845 --> 00:17:33,145
<b>You're really a shaman?</b>

177
00:17:33,145 --> 00:17:34,776
<b>Labels aren't important.</b>

178
00:17:35,476 --> 00:17:38,446
<b>Soothsayers, prophets, things like that don't matter.</b>

179
00:17:39,186 --> 00:17:41,315
<b>What the deity says is what matters.</b>

180
00:17:42,486 --> 00:17:44,615
<b>What a bunch of nonsense.</b>

181
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,226
<b>Nonsense.</b>

182
00:17:51,395 --> 00:17:53,226
<b>I thought you of all people...</b>

183
00:17:53,895 --> 00:17:55,395
<b>would understand.</b>

184
00:17:55,535 --> 00:17:58,365
<b>You say you hear divine revelations, but you didn't know you'd be mocked?</b>

185
00:18:00,236 --> 00:18:01,736
<b>I thought you wanted to know about...</b>

186
00:18:02,135 --> 00:18:04,635
<b>the woman who was hit by a claw hammer and died 20 years ago?</b>

187
00:18:08,746 --> 00:18:10,716
<b>Weren't all the victims from back then men?</b>

188
00:18:11,176 --> 00:18:13,016
<b>All of them were men.</b>

189
00:18:22,926 --> 00:18:24,055
<b>You want to know, right?</b>

190
00:18:27,825 --> 00:18:28,895
<b>That pretty woman...</b>

191
00:18:30,635 --> 00:18:32,135
<b>who was dying.</b>

192
00:18:35,236 --> 00:18:36,406
<b>She was your mom, right?</b>

193
00:18:44,216 --> 00:18:45,416
<b>Mom?</b>

194
00:18:49,256 --> 00:18:50,355
<b>It was you.</b>

195
00:18:53,456 --> 00:18:54,785
<b>You killed her.</b>

196
00:19:03,996 --> 00:19:05,335
<b>It was your fault.</b>

197
00:19:09,406 --> 00:19:10,875
<b>She died because of you.</b>

198
00:19:11,906 --> 00:19:12,976
<b>Don't give me that nonsense.</b>

199
00:19:12,976 --> 00:19:14,676
<b>You drew danger upon yourself.</b>

200
00:19:15,776 --> 00:19:17,115
<b>Don't lose your cool.</b>

201
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,686
<b>- Why did you kill her? - His wrath...</b>

202
00:19:19,686 --> 00:19:20,785
<b>You're the murderer.</b>

203
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:23,055
<b>- The murders will continue. - Get him out.</b>

204
00:19:23,115 --> 00:19:25,756
<b>Was she really my mother?</b>

205
00:19:25,756 --> 00:19:27,355
<b>More will be murdered.</b>

206
00:19:27,355 --> 00:19:28,855
<b>Was she my mother? Tell me!</b>

207
00:19:28,855 --> 00:19:31,196
<b>Three more will die before the month is over.</b>

208
00:19:31,196 --> 00:19:32,325
<b>Tell me, you scumbag!</b>

209
00:19:32,325 --> 00:19:34,996
<b>The people cursed because of you will die brutal deaths!</b>

210
00:19:34,996 --> 00:19:37,135
<b>Stop changing the subject! Let go. Let go.</b>

211
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:39,605
<b>Tell me. Tell me, you jerk!</b>

212
00:19:39,605 --> 00:19:41,105
<b>- Get him out. - No!</b>

213
00:19:45,446 --> 00:19:46,746
<b>We have the lab results.</b>

214
00:19:48,246 --> 00:19:50,815
<b>The skeletons were from animals.</b>

215
00:19:50,946 --> 00:19:52,486
<b>There was no human DNA.</b>

216
00:20:12,406 --> 00:20:15,006
<b>We'll have to detain him and investigate.</b>

217
00:20:18,035 --> 00:20:19,746
<b>Will we get a detention warrant?</b>

218
00:20:20,605 --> 00:20:22,575
<b>He merely went to the crime scenes as a photographer.</b>

219
00:20:22,615 --> 00:20:23,976
<b>We'll have to try.</b>

220
00:20:24,446 --> 00:20:26,345
<b>He mentioned the woman's death himself.</b>

221
00:20:28,615 --> 00:20:29,716
<b>What's this about your mom?</b>

222
00:20:33,385 --> 00:20:35,355
<b>We need to include everything so we can get the warrant.</b>

223
00:20:41,095 --> 00:20:43,766
<b>Tell him about your childhood memory.</b>

224
00:20:43,865 --> 00:20:44,966
<b>What do you want to put down?</b>

225
00:20:46,006 --> 00:20:49,236
<b>I think I saw a woman die 20 years ago, and that psycho...</b>

226
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:50,805
<b>pretending to be a shaman knew that?</b>

227
00:20:52,946 --> 00:20:55,006
<b>We'll assume we can't detain him and investigate accordingly.</b>

228
00:20:55,516 --> 00:20:57,315
<b>We must have all available officers watch him closely.</b>

229
00:20:57,315 --> 00:21:00,216
<b>Watching him is fine, but we need to find evidence.</b>

230
00:21:00,315 --> 00:21:03,115
<b>He will kill again just as he prophesied.</b>

231
00:21:03,115 --> 00:21:05,115
<b>- Do you believe him? - Yes, I do.</b>

232
00:21:05,115 --> 00:21:06,355
<b>And he'll proudly kill three more people.</b>

233
00:21:06,355 --> 00:21:08,325
<b>You don't know when he'll act. We can't just watch him forever.</b>

234
00:21:08,325 --> 00:21:11,555
<b>He said before the month ends,</b>

235
00:21:11,656 --> 00:21:12,795
<b>three will die.</b>

236
00:21:13,065 --> 00:21:14,365
<b>We have 10 days left in the month.</b>

237
00:21:15,835 --> 00:21:17,436
<b>He'll act before then.</b>

238
00:21:18,335 --> 00:21:19,966
<b>He seemed confident.</b>

239
00:21:21,605 --> 00:21:22,805
<b>He has a trick up his sleeve.</b>

240
00:21:22,805 --> 00:21:25,345
<b>He's not the only one who is confident.</b>

241
00:21:27,946 --> 00:21:30,246
<b>I have no intention of losing either.</b>

242
00:21:38,855 --> 00:21:43,926
<b>(Criminal Department)</b>

243
00:22:04,815 --> 00:22:08,115
<b>Thank you. It's kind of you to see me out like this.</b>

244
00:22:09,016 --> 00:22:10,156
<b>I wanted to get rid of the stench.</b>

245
00:22:11,656 --> 00:22:13,825
<b>We'll soon meet again.</b>

246
00:22:18,766 --> 00:22:20,026
<b>By the way,</b>

247
00:22:23,095 --> 00:22:25,605
<b>the stench is actually coming from something else.</b>

248
00:22:27,305 --> 00:22:28,406
<b>What?</b>

249
00:22:29,276 --> 00:22:31,406
<b>You're both surrounded...</b>

250
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:33,045
<b>by vindictive spirits.</b>

251
00:22:33,776 --> 00:22:35,375
<b>Do you never stop talking nonsense?</b>

252
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:47,825
<b>Two women...</b>

253
00:22:51,496 --> 00:22:53,426
<b>had to kill each other.</b>

254
00:22:57,936 --> 00:23:00,065
<b>Because if they didn't, they would've gotten killed...</b>

255
00:23:01,335 --> 00:23:02,506
<b>by the murderer.</b>

256
00:23:02,706 --> 00:23:04,776
<b>If you're so confident, leave behind some evidence.</b>

257
00:23:04,776 --> 00:23:07,105
<b>The vindictive spirts are warning you.</b>

258
00:23:14,315 --> 00:23:16,285
<b>Someone's going to get murdered...</b>

259

<b>tonight.</b>

260
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:36,835
<b>I hope you stop it.</b>

261
00:23:38,776 --> 00:23:39,946
<b>If you can, that is.</b>

262
00:23:42,516 --> 00:23:43,776
<b>You will be responsible...</b>

263
00:23:45,845 --> 00:23:47,986
<b>for that death.</b>

264
00:23:50,256 --> 00:23:51,986
<b>- What? - You're right.</b>

265
00:23:52,855 --> 00:23:55,355
<b>I'll be the one sending you to jail.</b>

266
00:24:10,406 --> 00:24:11,535
<b>Tonight?</b>

267
00:24:11,535 --> 00:24:14,305
<b>How interesting. He's crazier than expected.</b>

268
00:24:14,706 --> 00:24:16,875
<b>He's going to do something tonight.</b>

269
00:24:17,246 --> 00:24:19,016
<b>He just wants to play a game.</b>

270
00:24:19,446 --> 00:24:20,615
<b>He's trying to prove...</b>

271
00:24:21,845 --> 00:24:23,385
<b>that he's superior than us.</b>

272

<b>(Green Moving)</b>

273
00:25:01,385 --> 00:25:02,756
<b>Don't even lose him for a second...</b>

274
00:25:02,996 --> 00:25:06,226
<b>so we can stop him from meeting an accomplice.</b>

275
00:25:06,565 --> 00:25:07,625
<b>Got it, ma'am.</b>

276
00:25:07,795 --> 00:25:10,065
<b>Gosh, whatever. I don't care if we lose him.</b>

277
00:25:10,196 --> 00:25:13,206
<b>What? There's going to be a murder tonight.</b>

278
00:25:14,135 --> 00:25:16,706
<b>Look at the previous murders. They were brutally murdered.</b>

279
00:25:17,805 --> 00:25:19,476
<b>He's the Executioner.</b>

280
00:25:19,605 --> 00:25:22,075
<b>I wouldn't be surprised if someone really gets murdered tonight.</b>

281
00:25:22,375 --> 00:25:24,216
<b>It's fine as long as we're safe.</b>

282
00:25:25,016 --> 00:25:26,085
<b>But...</b>

283
00:25:35,355 --> 00:25:37,256
<b>What is he doing in the dark?</b>

284
00:25:38,156 --> 00:25:39,166
<b>Do we have infrared cameras?</b>

285
00:25:39,166 --> 00:25:41,496
<b>No. It's not showing on the thermal image camera either.</b>

286
00:25:42,535 --> 00:25:45,605
<b>There are dozens of cops there. He can't murder anyone.</b>

287
00:26:37,716 --> 00:26:38,926
<b>The sun's up.</b>

288
00:26:39,785 --> 00:26:40,885
<b>Check all the new cases.</b>

289
00:26:42,855 --> 00:26:46,426
<b>There are a few accidental deaths...</b>

290
00:26:47,466 --> 00:26:48,526
<b>Ms. Han.</b>

291
00:26:50,535 --> 00:26:51,996
<b>Someone got murdered.</b>

292
00:26:52,466 --> 00:26:54,236
<b>- "Murdered"? - Who is it?</b>

293
00:26:58,375 --> 00:27:01,276
<b>The victim is someone you know.</b>

294
00:27:10,085 --> 00:27:11,555
<b>I came at dawn to pack my stuff...</b>

295
00:27:12,325 --> 00:27:13,526
<b>because I didn't want to run into him.</b>

296
00:27:15,625 --> 00:27:16,795
<b>But when I got here...</b>

297
00:27:23,666 --> 00:27:25,605
<b>Someone's going to get murdered...</b>

298
00:27:26,865 --> 00:27:28,006
<b>tonight.</b>

299
00:27:34,605 --> 00:27:36,375
<b>Rape and blackmail.</b>

300
00:27:37,845 --> 00:27:39,486
<b>A scumbag with a hammer tattoo.</b>

301
00:27:39,845 --> 00:27:41,315
<b>Were you guys on bad terms?</b>

302
00:27:41,845 --> 00:27:43,956
<b>Sir, can you please protect me?</b>

303
00:27:43,956 --> 00:27:45,656
<b>I bet I'm the next target.</b>

304
00:28:05,605 --> 00:28:06,776
<b>What is he doing?</b>

305
00:28:08,345 --> 00:28:10,676
<b>- He heard a sound. - "A sound"?</b>

306
00:28:32,666 --> 00:28:35,105
<b>Do you think Jin Jae Gyu is really a shaman?</b>

307
00:28:35,976 --> 00:28:38,206
<b>It can't be him. He was being watched by dozens of cops.</b>

308
00:28:38,206 --> 00:28:39,276
<b>Shut it.</b>

309
00:28:39,446 --> 00:28:40,845
<b>Maybe it was someone else.</b>

310
00:28:41,176 --> 00:28:42,575
<b>This guy had a lot of enemies.</b>

311
00:28:43,446 --> 00:28:44,516
<b>It's the Executioner.</b>

312
00:28:45,216 --> 00:28:47,345
<b>He is punishing evil by becoming evil himself.</b>

313
00:28:48,186 --> 00:28:49,785
<b>He punished him by doing exactly what he did to the victims.</b>

314
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:53,285
<b>Where do you think this ink came from?</b>

315
00:28:55,585 --> 00:28:56,726
<b>How interesting.</b>

316
00:28:58,055 --> 00:28:59,426
<b>He even recorded a video...</b>

317
00:29:00,996 --> 00:29:02,026
<b>of beating the guy to death.</b>

318
00:29:08,006 --> 00:29:09,105
<b>My gosh.</b>

319
00:29:11,605 --> 00:29:12,706
<b>Who's there?</b>

320
00:29:13,345 --> 00:29:14,545
<b>Who are you?</b>

321
00:29:26,785 --> 00:29:27,825
<b>Wait.</b>

322
00:29:34,395 --> 00:29:35,966
<b>No, wait.</b>

323
00:29:35,966 --> 00:29:37,295
<b>Wait. Please don't kill me.</b>

324
00:29:37,595 --> 00:29:39,135
<b>What did I do wrong?</b>

325
00:29:52,246 --> 00:29:54,545
<b>Can you rewind to the part where he throws him on the ground?</b>

326
00:30:06,196 --> 00:30:07,526
<b>I only see his feet.</b>

327
00:30:07,895 --> 00:30:08,895
<b>Let's watch when he closes the window.</b>

328
00:30:09,466 --> 00:30:10,466
<b>Okay.</b>

329
00:30:16,535 --> 00:30:17,605
<b>Slowly.</b>

330
00:30:20,305 --> 00:30:21,976
<b>Stop. Make it brighter.</b>

331
00:30:22,516 --> 00:30:23,615
<b>As bright as possible.</b>

332
00:30:28,746 --> 00:30:30,555
<b>- His face is black. - What is that?</b>

333
00:30:31,416 --> 00:30:32,486
<b>Is that a ghost?</b>

334
00:30:35,226 --> 00:30:36,325
<b>A mask.</b>

335
00:30:37,625 --> 00:30:39,055
<b>"A mask"?</b>

336
00:30:40,466 --> 00:30:41,595
<b>We stayed up for nothing.</b>

337
00:30:44,266 --> 00:30:45,595
<b>He's leaving the house.</b>

338
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:47,236
<b>I think he's going for a walk.</b>

339
00:30:50,176 --> 00:30:52,075
<b>Field seven. We're on him.</b>

340
00:30:57,875 --> 00:31:00,285
<b>He stopped walking at the three-way intersection.</b>

341
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:07,686
<b>Do you think it was a copycat crime?</b>

342
00:31:07,686 --> 00:31:09,926
<b>That's impossible. Only a few people in...</b>

343
00:31:09,926 --> 00:31:11,325
<b>the investigation unit are the ones who know about the Executioner.</b>

344
00:31:11,426 --> 00:31:12,996
<b>Then could it be an accomplice?</b>

345
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:15,226
<b>No, it can't be an accomplice.</b>

346
00:31:15,496 --> 00:31:16,865
<b>He never met anyone.</b>

347
00:31:17,966 --> 00:31:19,805
<b>- What about his call logs? - Nothing.</b>

348
00:31:20,006 --> 00:31:21,436
<b>He didn't email or call anyone.</b>

349
00:31:21,666 --> 00:31:24,605
<b>We checked all the cell phones in the neighborhood.</b>

350
00:31:25,476 --> 00:31:27,246
<b>And we found nothing in particular.</b>

351
00:31:35,615 --> 00:31:36,785
<b>Where are you going?</b>

352
00:31:37,956 --> 00:31:39,055
<b>Where are you going?</b>

353
00:31:39,625 --> 00:31:40,785
<b>My gosh.</b>

354
00:31:45,256 --> 00:31:47,895
<b>Who wants to take a photo with Hodori?</b>

355
00:31:47,895 --> 00:31:50,095
<b>- Me! - Me!</b>

356
00:31:50,095 --> 00:31:52,335
<b>- Who is the kid? - I don't know.</b>

357
00:31:52,605 --> 00:31:54,305
<b>It's a boy, but they all look the same.</b>

358
00:31:54,506 --> 00:31:55,605
<b>They all look different.</b>

359
00:31:55,605 --> 00:31:57,605
<b>Will you hurry up? I might lose my pension.</b>

360
00:31:57,706 --> 00:32:01,375
<b>- Me! - Me!</b>

361
00:32:01,375 --> 00:32:02,845
<b>Here we go guys!</b>

362
00:32:09,016 --> 00:32:10,555
<b>- It's my turn. - Me too.</b>

363
00:32:11,085 --> 00:32:12,686
<b>- What now? - They're too thick.</b>

364
00:32:13,726 --> 00:32:15,555
<b>- Unbelievable. - Me!</b>

365
00:32:15,825 --> 00:32:17,625
<b>- Can I go first? - No, me first.</b>

366
00:32:18,496 --> 00:32:20,026
<b>- Me! - No. It's my turn.</b>

367
00:32:23,166 --> 00:32:25,065
<b>Me next.</b>

368
00:32:37,516 --> 00:32:38,716
<b>A kid from the neighborhood?</b>

369
00:32:39,176 --> 00:32:41,115
<b>The kid's mom used to manage Jin Jae Gyu's greenhouse.</b>

370
00:32:41,416 --> 00:32:42,716
<b>That is how he used the kid's phone.</b>

371
00:32:43,456 --> 00:32:44,656
<b>Did you conduct an illegal scan?</b>

372
00:32:45,186 --> 00:32:47,585
<b>Don't get stuffy with me. That isn't the issue at the moment.</b>

373
00:32:47,656 --> 00:32:49,325
<b>We can't use tainted evidence.</b>

374
00:32:49,395 --> 00:32:51,026
<b>I'm not part of the team anyway.</b>

375
00:32:51,125 --> 00:32:54,196
<b>Get a warrant based on the contact with the mother.</b>

376
00:32:55,726 --> 00:32:57,595
<b>Head to Jin Jae Gyu's house with the kid in two hours.</b>

377
00:32:57,936 --> 00:32:59,305
<b>Otherwise, we will have to wait for another week.</b>

378
00:33:01,135 --> 00:33:03,105
<b>The warrant will take at least half a day.</b>

379
00:33:03,105 --> 00:33:05,835
<b>I don't care how, but get it in two hours.</b>

380
00:33:11,676 --> 00:33:13,915
<b>6424, please pull over.</b>

381
00:33:14,085 --> 00:33:15,616
<b>Pull over.</b>

382
00:33:33,205 --> 00:33:34,866
<b>It seems like you have a flat tire.</b>

383
00:33:35,366 --> 00:33:36,835
<b>But I just had it inflated yesterday.</b>

384
00:33:39,105 --> 00:33:40,205
<b>The engine oil is the issue.</b>

385
00:33:40,705 --> 00:33:42,406
<b>I had that swapped out too.</b>

386
00:33:43,776 --> 00:33:47,286
<b>Good job on that. It's crucial to keep it that way.</b>

00:33:58,495 --> 00:33:59,526
<b>Begin the process.</b>

<b>Would you like to take a photo with me?</b>

394

<b>Good.</b>

395
00:34:24,786 --> 00:34:26,386
<b>Hi, kid. How about a photo?</b>

396
00:34:26,886 --> 00:34:27,986

<b>Can you smile more?</b>

402
00:34:49,616 --> 00:34:51,846
<b>Maybe I should come closer.</b>

<b>The daughter of a murder victim joins the police seeking revenge.</b>

<b>- This is my duty. - Then I applaud you.</b>

<b>Saying false truths about me in front of others?</b>

<b>Does that count as defamation or contempt?</b>

456

<b>I wonder if you know...</b>

<b>that Mr. Jin obtained an astonishing gift.</b>

458

<b>He just mentioned a secret of mine that I haven't told others...</b>

<b>which was surprising.</b>

<b>I was begging him to do a special show with me.</b>

<b>Are you truly a killer?</b>

464
00:39:27,556 --> 00:39:30,455
<b>You see, I believe the Executioner...</b>

465
00:39:30,455 --> 00:39:32,495
<b>to be a gutsy person.</b>

<b>He burns animals that the law couldn't punish.</b>

471

<b>I can easily land an exclusive interview.</b>

<b>Who else but the Executioner has seriously questioned...</b>

473
00:39:57,315 --> 00:39:59,286
<b>this nation's justice system?</b>

474
00:39:59,725 --> 00:40:01,685
<b>You value ratings over people's lives?</b>

475
00:40:02,225 --> 00:40:03,326
<b>People's lives?</b>

476
00:40:04,295 --> 00:40:06,125
<b>Now that you mention it,</b>

477
00:40:06,966 --> 00:40:08,565
<b>it seems like you're still in denial.</b>

478
00:40:09,466 --> 00:40:11,636
<b>You won't admit that your father deserved it.</b>

479
00:40:11,636 --> 00:40:14,466
<b>- Shut it. - Blood may be thicker than water,</b>

480
00:40:14,705 --> 00:40:16,306
<b>but his life isn't worth taking revenge...</b>

481
00:40:16,835 --> 00:40:18,835
<b>- You scumbag. - Is this how it'll be?</b>

482
00:40:18,835 --> 00:40:21,745
<b>She's fulfilling her duty as a cop and revenge is my specialty.</b>

483
00:40:22,375 --> 00:40:23,446
<b>Understand?</b>

484
00:40:25,745 --> 00:40:27,346
<b>You dare lay hands of an editor-in-chief?</b>

485
00:40:27,386 --> 00:40:30,386
<b>Sue me then. It'll go on record how you...</b>

486
00:40:30,616 --> 00:40:33,125
<b>built your career by selling murder.</b>

487
00:40:33,125 --> 00:40:35,056
<b>- You piece of... - Don't touch him.</b>

488
00:40:36,855 --> 00:40:38,596
<b>Don't lay hands on other people.</b>

489
00:40:40,596 --> 00:40:42,765
<b>- Want me to break your neck too? - Don't you get it?</b>

490
00:40:44,565 --> 00:40:47,565
<b>What do the three that will die have in common?</b>

491
00:40:50,036 --> 00:40:51,506
<b>You would've...</b>

492
00:40:53,506 --> 00:40:55,346
<b>made contact with them.</b>

493
00:41:04,015 --> 00:41:05,156
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

494
00:41:05,515 --> 00:41:06,526
<b>Three will die?</b>

495
00:41:14,596 --> 00:41:16,026
<b>They will die...</b>

496
00:41:17,866 --> 00:41:19,165
<b>mercilessly.</b>

497
00:41:22,105 --> 00:41:24,676
<b>As the moon gets fuller,</b>

498
00:41:26,306 --> 00:41:29,245
<b>those who you have made contact with will brutally die.</b>

499
00:41:30,846 --> 00:41:32,846
<b>One is already dead,</b>

500
00:41:34,415 --> 00:41:36,986
<b>and two will soon follow.</b>

501
00:41:59,306 --> 00:42:00,906
<b>Will he really kill those you have touched?</b>

502
00:42:01,006 --> 00:42:02,006
<b>Probably.</b>

503
00:42:02,545 --> 00:42:04,915
<b>- What if it's a trick? - It's obviously a trick.</b>

504
00:42:05,946 --> 00:42:08,245
<b>He can't know whom I physically contacted...</b>

505
00:42:08,245 --> 00:42:09,585
<b>unless he's a real shaman.</b>

506
00:42:10,386 --> 00:42:12,455
<b>Then a random person... No.</b>

507
00:42:13,486 --> 00:42:14,756
<b>That's not his style.</b>

508
00:42:14,855 --> 00:42:19,026
<b>Naturally, he has to kill someone I came in contact with to win.</b>

509
00:42:19,826 --> 00:42:21,725
<b>- Then... - Let's see...</b>

510
00:42:21,725 --> 00:42:22,826
<b>just how much he knows.</b>

511
00:42:27,435 --> 00:42:29,605
<b>We'll return your phones once the investigation is over.</b>

512
00:42:30,236 --> 00:42:32,975
<b>Are you saying my kid's phone was used for a crime?</b>

513
00:42:33,076 --> 00:42:34,306
<b>What crime?</b>

514
00:42:34,875 --> 00:42:36,975
<b>We can't share the details of an ongoing investigation.</b>

515
00:42:36,975 --> 00:42:38,475
<b>We need to know who it is.</b>

516
00:42:38,475 --> 00:42:39,886
<b>You're saying that the suspect is near our child.</b>

517
00:42:40,116 --> 00:42:42,045
<b>We are watching the suspect around the clock...</b>

518
00:42:42,045 --> 00:42:43,455
<b>We can't give you the phone if you don't tell us.</b>

519
00:42:43,455 --> 00:42:44,486
<b>Jin Jae Gyu.</b>

520
00:42:45,685 --> 00:42:47,185
<b>Mr. Jin?</b>

521
00:42:47,185 --> 00:42:48,786
<b>For what...</b>

522
00:42:49,786 --> 00:42:50,955
<b>Don't go anywhere near him.</b>

523
00:42:55,926 --> 00:42:57,565
<b>How did you end up taking care of his greenhouse?</b>

524
00:42:57,565 --> 00:42:59,395
<b>A few months ago,</b>

525
00:42:59,736 --> 00:43:02,466
<b>not long after he moved here, he came to me.</b>

526
00:43:03,006 --> 00:43:04,276
<b>He wanted to buy equipment.</b>

527
00:43:04,435 --> 00:43:06,605
<b>I run a small export business.</b>

528
00:43:07,375 --> 00:43:08,605
<b>Which equipment?</b>

529
00:43:09,205 --> 00:43:11,315
<b>He said he was fixing up the house.</b>

530
00:43:11,315 --> 00:43:13,616
<b>What was it? Yes. Water pump.</b>

531
00:43:14,045 --> 00:43:15,085
<b>Water pump?</b>

532
00:43:15,085 --> 00:43:17,656
<b>He said his basement had flooded. I told him...</b>

533
00:43:17,855 --> 00:43:19,616
<b>it would be cheaper to rent,</b>

534
00:43:19,986 --> 00:43:21,455
<b>but he insisted on buying it.</b>

535
00:43:21,556 --> 00:43:23,056
<b>I don't usually do retail.</b>

536
00:43:23,056 --> 00:43:26,056
<b>But I made an exception since he was a neighbor.</b>

537
00:43:26,495 --> 00:43:28,196
<b>Then he brought over a cell phone a few days later.</b>

538
00:43:29,065 --> 00:43:30,536
<b>He said he got it as a gift,</b>

539
00:43:30,765 --> 00:43:34,165
<b>but he liked the one he had, and gave it to our son as a gift.</b>

540
00:43:35,006 --> 00:43:37,636
<b>That's when he saw that I ran a flower shop,</b>

541
00:43:37,636 --> 00:43:39,236
<b>and asked me to look after his greenhouse.</b>

542
00:43:59,995 --> 00:44:01,125
<b>Why aren't you getting in?</b>

543
00:44:05,165 --> 00:44:06,435
<b>That's everyone I touched.</b>

544
00:44:06,835 --> 00:44:08,866
<b>Find out which of them he'll go after.</b>

545
00:44:11,536 --> 00:44:15,076
<b>If by chance he really is a shaman, that is.</b>

546
00:44:16,006 --> 00:44:18,616
<b>Why am I not on this list?</b>

547
00:44:20,216 --> 00:44:21,486
<b>I'll stay here.</b>

548
00:44:21,486 --> 00:44:22,685
<b>I have more work to do.</b>

549
00:44:26,185 --> 00:44:29,125
<b>- Hello? - Turn on the news right now.</b>

550
00:44:29,526 --> 00:44:30,696
<b>It's true.</b>

551
00:44:30,855 --> 00:44:31,855
<b>(Colleague Police Officer)</b>

552
00:44:31,855 --> 00:44:33,795
<b>Her father was murdered because of a grudge.</b>

553
00:44:34,395 --> 00:44:36,636
<b>She has been digging into that cold case for years.</b>

554
00:44:36,636 --> 00:44:39,265
<b>He was a terrible human being. That's probably why he was killed.</b>

555
00:44:39,265 --> 00:44:40,406
<b>It's very serious.</b>

556
00:44:40,565 --> 00:44:43,375
<b>It means she was using her authority for personal reasons.</b>

557
00:44:43,776 --> 00:44:46,205
<b>It's not only against the law for a victim to investigate...</b>

558
00:44:46,335 --> 00:44:48,475
<b>her personal case, it is improper.</b>

559
00:44:48,576 --> 00:44:51,645
<b>The serious abuse of authority by a victim's child...</b>

560
00:44:51,645 --> 00:44:53,886
<b>in improperly taking revenge.</b>

561
00:44:54,045 --> 00:44:56,245
<b>We will look into it further tomorrow.</b>

562
00:44:56,616 --> 00:44:58,886
<b>With TVC News, this is Park Sa Myung.</b>

563
00:45:02,486 --> 00:45:05,295
<b>The report itself is trash too, but the situation stinks as well.</b>

564
00:45:05,495 --> 00:45:07,026
<b>The daughter of the Executioner's victim is gnashing her teeth...</b>

565
00:45:07,026 --> 00:45:08,526
<b>after 20 years.</b>

566
00:45:08,526 --> 00:45:11,065
<b>Gosh. But we're just sitting here shuffling papers.</b>

567
00:45:12,265 --> 00:45:16,435
<b>You and your stupid mouth. Your mouth is the problem.</b>

568
00:45:17,736 --> 00:45:18,806
<b>Gosh.</b>

569
00:45:45,335 --> 00:45:46,466
<b>How's the cell phone restoration coming along?</b>

570
00:45:47,435 --> 00:45:49,806
<b>Forensics says it'll be hard to finish today.</b>

571
00:45:50,536 --> 00:45:53,176
<b>- Pressure them. - We are, but...</b>

572
00:45:53,406 --> 00:45:56,276
<b>Field Nine. Two chicks entering the wild dog's vicinity.</b>

573
00:45:59,176 --> 00:46:01,946
<b>The yellow chicks changed their feathers.</b>

574
00:46:02,685 --> 00:46:04,556
<b>He wants us to find a water pump.</b>

575
00:46:05,486 --> 00:46:08,026
<b>He always orders around this old man without any explanations.</b>

576
00:46:08,685 --> 00:46:09,926
<b>Do you really not understand...</b>

577
00:46:10,056 --> 00:46:13,156
<b>why Baek picks on you more than anyone else?</b>

578
00:46:13,326 --> 00:46:16,895
<b>Don't say it's because I'm such a magnanimous person.</b>

579
00:46:17,196 --> 00:46:19,335
<b>No, it's because...</b>

580
00:46:19,736 --> 00:46:21,765
<b>you're a chump. You breed abusive people.</b>

581
00:46:21,765 --> 00:46:23,065
<b>Are you taking after Baek?</b>

582
00:46:24,536 --> 00:46:28,045
<b>You grumble, but you always take it. That's why he won't stop.</b>

583
00:46:28,205 --> 00:46:30,145
<b>I have a profound reason for it.</b>

584
00:46:30,815 --> 00:46:33,645
<b>What profound reason? To last until you retire? The pension?</b>

585
00:46:34,486 --> 00:46:37,616
<b>Way deep down within this captain of yours,</b>

586
00:46:37,815 --> 00:46:40,725
<b>I have a very profound reason that I can't explain.</b>

587
00:46:41,185 --> 00:46:42,986
<b>- You're just a chump. - You punk.</b>

588
00:46:43,855 --> 00:46:45,826
<b>- At least pretend you are working. - Okay.</b>

589
00:46:53,866 --> 00:46:55,105
<b>What should we do?</b>

590
00:46:59,036 --> 00:47:00,176
<b>Let them be.</b>

591
00:47:02,705 --> 00:47:05,446
<b>Field Nine. Don't follow the chicks. Just watch them.</b>

<b>The final target is Dong Baek.</b>

602

<b>I want every reporter from every department on this...</b>

<b>Yes, sir. What are we trying to uncover about them?</b>

<b>- It does not matter. - Yes, sir.</b>

606

<b>Repeated assault is not enough.</b>

<b>We need something stronger and dirtier.</b>

<b>Find everything you can!</b>

609

<b>Should we dig into Dong Baek's private life too?</b>

610

<b>"Should we?" Why you...</b>

<b>Bring me everything!</b>

612

<b>You have your hidden card, right?</b>

613
00:48:15,315 --> 00:48:18,515
<b>- A hidden card? - Yes, I laid the groundwork.</b>

614
00:48:18,756 --> 00:48:21,855
<b>- For what? - They despise all reporters,</b>

615

<b>The ones who bark first aren't confident...</b>

00:49:45,875 --> 00:49:47,745
<b>I never knew you were an expert on dogs.</b>

628
00:49:48,346 --> 00:49:49,475
<b>The media are dogs.</b>

629
00:49:49,676 --> 00:49:51,915
<b>They can't even look you in the eye if they see you in person,</b>

630
00:49:52,116 --> 00:49:55,245
<b>but they bark as if they're brave before the camera and with the pen.</b>

631
00:49:55,386 --> 00:49:57,486
<b>Why? Because they know that the more they bark,</b>

632
00:49:57,955 --> 00:49:59,786
<b>TV, radio, and newspapers...</b>

633
00:49:59,915 --> 00:50:02,185
<b>will become a barrier and protect them.</b>

634
00:50:03,056 --> 00:50:05,926
<b>So? Is that why you reacted as soon as they barked?</b>

635
00:50:07,196 --> 00:50:09,526
<b>What should you do to silence dogs?</b>

636
00:50:09,926 --> 00:50:11,265
<b>You should crush their jaws.</b>

637
00:50:15,036 --> 00:50:16,705
<b>That's why you're inferior.</b>

638
00:50:17,435 --> 00:50:20,205
<b>If you kick one dog, all the dogs in the area will bark.</b>

639
00:50:20,205 --> 00:50:21,475
<b>Why?</b>

640
00:50:22,276 --> 00:50:24,576
<b>Because that's the survival instinct of those cowards.</b>

641
00:50:26,446 --> 00:50:27,786
<b>You disappear...</b>

642
00:50:29,216 --> 00:50:30,616
<b>so they quiet down immediately.</b>

643
00:50:31,855 --> 00:50:33,486
<b>It sounds like defeat and humiliation,</b>

644
00:50:34,256 --> 00:50:35,455
<b>only glamorized.</b>

645
00:50:35,786 --> 00:50:37,026
<b>What humiliation?</b>

646
00:50:37,256 --> 00:50:40,326
<b>Isn't it humiliating to fire me just because of a trashy report...</b>

647
00:50:40,326 --> 00:50:42,225
<b>when a serial killer is within our grasp?</b>

648
00:50:42,565 --> 00:50:43,665
<b>Who fired you?</b>

649
00:50:44,696 --> 00:50:46,636
<b>You are still in charge of the special team.</b>

650
00:50:46,636 --> 00:50:47,835
<b>Keep investigating.</b>

651
00:50:48,605 --> 00:50:50,065
<b>- But... - You'll await assignment...</b>

652
00:50:50,065 --> 00:50:52,676
<b>at most for a week. If you don't catch the killer by then,</b>

653
00:50:52,676 --> 00:50:54,906
<b>I'll say I need you and reinstate you.</b>

654
00:50:54,906 --> 00:50:57,946
<b>Even if you do catch the killer before then, you announce it.</b>

655
00:50:57,946 --> 00:51:00,716
<b>You'll continue to grow as the icon of the police department...</b>

656
00:51:00,716 --> 00:51:02,286
<b>without a scratch.</b>

657
00:51:02,386 --> 00:51:03,585
<b>I don't need the glory.</b>

658
00:51:03,585 --> 00:51:05,116
<b>The next few hours are critical.</b>

659
00:51:05,116 --> 00:51:06,915
<b>Keep investigating in secret.</b>

660
00:51:08,125 --> 00:51:09,355
<b>I told Young Soo...</b>

661
00:51:09,355 --> 00:51:11,756
<b>that your orders will be sent out as the head of Metro.</b>

662
00:51:11,756 --> 00:51:15,495
<b>However, don't go to the station for a week. Run it remotely.</b>

663
00:51:21,705 --> 00:51:22,866
<b>Do you not like it?</b>

664
00:51:24,435 --> 00:51:25,506
<b>Thank you.</b>

665
00:51:26,835 --> 00:51:28,045
<b>You may go.</b>

666

<b>(Mr. Jo Sung Dong)</b>

667
00:51:37,815 --> 00:51:41,855
<b>Are you close to Mr. Jo Sung Dong by any chance?</b>

668
00:51:44,455 --> 00:51:45,526
<b>What?</b>

669
00:51:49,265 --> 00:51:53,295
<b>I met him once at an event. Why?</b>

670
00:51:55,605 --> 00:51:57,506
<b>I wondered if you knew each other for a while,</b>

671
00:51:58,406 --> 00:52:00,946
<b>for example, for about 20 years?</b>

672
00:52:05,716 --> 00:52:06,716
<b>Never mind.</b>

673
00:52:07,716 --> 00:52:08,745
<b>(Mr. Jo Sung Dong)</b>

674
00:52:18,096 --> 00:52:19,455
<b>(Call Logs)</b>

675
00:53:00,236 --> 00:53:01,306
<b>I found out...</b>

676
00:53:01,765 --> 00:53:02,835
<b>Jin Jae Gyu's trick.</b>

677
00:53:06,090 --> 00:53:08,519
<b>I heard it's been abandoned for years.</b>

678
00:53:09,289 --> 00:53:11,889
<b>It was owned by a foreign corporation.</b>

679
00:53:11,889 --> 00:53:14,960
<b>But yesterday, the owner got switched to someone else.</b>

680
00:53:15,059 --> 00:53:16,130
<b>To who?</b>

681
00:53:16,199 --> 00:53:17,230
<b>It's a high school kid,</b>

682
00:53:17,230 --> 00:53:18,929
<b>and it turns out he's Jo Sung Dong's son.</b>

683
00:53:19,570 --> 00:53:21,499
<b>He's studying overseas, and his mom went with him.</b>

684
00:53:21,499 --> 00:53:23,240
<b>So Jo Sung Dong probably bought it for him.</b>

685
00:53:26,969 --> 00:53:29,110
<b>Old man, I want you to go meet Jo Sung Dong.</b>

686
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:30,579
<b>- Why? - Ask him...</b>

687
00:53:30,579 --> 00:53:31,949
<b>why he accepted this building.</b>

688
00:53:32,150 --> 00:53:33,179
<b>Accepted it from whom?</b>

689
00:53:33,409 --> 00:53:34,480
<b>Jin Jae Gyu.</b>

690
00:53:35,219 --> 00:53:36,249
<b>"Jin Jae Gyu"?</b>

691
00:53:37,079 --> 00:53:38,949
<b>Act like you don't know that part.</b>

692
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:40,789
<b>Just ask him why he bought the building.</b>

693
00:53:41,289 --> 00:53:43,519
<b>That guy is the head...</b>

694
00:53:43,519 --> 00:53:46,230
<b>of a broadcasting station. Do you think he'll meet me?</b>

695
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:47,800
<b>He'll meet you if you tell him that I sent you.</b>

696
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:52,070
<b>By the way, when are you going to tell me your big picture?</b>

697
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:56,699
<b>He always hangs up once he's done talking.</b>

698
00:53:57,769 --> 00:53:59,510
<b>Call Mr. Jo's secretary.</b>

699
00:54:01,579 --> 00:54:03,179
<b>You're a fool who lets him treat you this way.</b>

700
00:54:05,110 --> 00:54:06,510
<b>I should just beat that punk.</b>

701
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:09,019
<b>How did you find this place?</b>

702
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:10,849
<b>The water pump.</b>

703
00:54:11,789 --> 00:54:13,289
<b>Oh, right. The water pump.</b>

704
00:54:14,289 --> 00:54:16,320
<b>I couldn't find a water pump in his house.</b>

705
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:19,289
<b>Let's request a search warrant...</b>

706
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:07,679
<b>How did you find this place with just a water pump?</b>

707
00:55:08,309 --> 00:55:09,579
<b>"Operation Anthropoid".</b>

708
00:55:10,309 --> 00:55:11,449
<b>"Operation Anthropoid"?</b>

709
00:55:11,679 --> 00:55:13,010
<b>A movie about assassinating a senior Nazi administrator...</b>

710
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:14,019
<b>during World War 2.</b>

711
00:55:14,249 --> 00:55:15,320
<b>The soldiers succeed in assassinating their target,</b>

712
00:55:15,519 --> 00:55:17,990
<b>but they get locked up in a church basement.</b>

713
00:55:18,050 --> 00:55:20,019
<b>But they continue to have hope even though they get surrounded.</b>

714
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:22,159
<b>Why? Because they think there's a secret passage...</b>

715
00:55:22,159 --> 00:55:24,030
<b>in the church basement.</b>

716
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:26,130
<b>"A secret passage"?</b>

717
00:55:37,909 --> 00:55:39,940
<b>In the end, they failed to find the secret passage.</b>

718
00:55:40,369 --> 00:55:42,409
<b>And when the enemies started pouring water into the basement,</b>

719
00:55:43,010 --> 00:55:44,980
<b>they all committed suicide.</b>

720
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:47,179
<b>But what does that movie have anything to do with this?</b>

721
00:55:51,449 --> 00:55:53,320
<b>It was the only movie that he owned.</b>

722
00:55:53,889 --> 00:55:55,360
<b>How could you tell just by looking at that?</b>

723
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:57,490
<b>The geology books helped me guess.</b>

724
00:56:00,699 --> 00:56:03,099
<b>I can't believe he got inspired and created an escape route.</b>

725
00:56:03,130 --> 00:56:04,869
<b>He needed a water pump because it kept filling with water.</b>

726
00:56:04,929 --> 00:56:07,769
<b>That's why I searched for the exit with a water pipe.</b>

727
00:56:11,210 --> 00:56:13,039
<b>He tricked us by pretending to warn us about the murders.</b>

728
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:15,940
<b>- He used to create an alibi... - Wait.</b>

729
00:58:24,170 --> 00:58:25,369
<b>It's a greenhouse.</b>

730
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:29,340
<b>Let's set up a trap...</b>

731
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:30,880
<b>- and wait for him to... - It's too late for that.</b>

732
00:58:42,090 --> 00:58:43,190
<b>A motorcycle?</b>

733
00:59:11,650 --> 00:59:14,119
<b>Jin Jae Gyu escaped through a secret passage.</b>

734
00:59:14,490 --> 00:59:16,059
<b>Track his motorcycle right now.</b>

735
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:17,960
<b>A real-time location tracing is impossible.</b>

736
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:19,230
<b>We restored the cell phone,</b>

737
00:59:19,230 --> 00:59:21,199
<b>and it looks like he searched some names.</b>

738
00:59:21,630 --> 00:59:23,960
<b>Choi Poong Won and Prosecutor Woo Seok Do.</b>

739
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:28,940
<b>Darn it.</b>

740
00:59:36,309 --> 00:59:37,579
<b>They're both people who deserve to die.</b>

741
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:43,179
<b>- Please move out of the way. - Out of the way.</b>

742
00:59:44,019 --> 00:59:45,619
<b>- Conditional medical release again? - Can you tell us what happened?</b>

743
00:59:45,619 --> 00:59:47,219
<b>- Out of the way. - Please move.</b>

744
00:59:47,219 --> 00:59:49,320
<b>- Can you please tell us? - Please get out of the way.</b>

745
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:50,960
<b>He did so many bad things but continued to live a fancy life,</b>

746
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:52,760
<b>after requesting for a conditional medical release.</b>

747
00:59:55,099 --> 00:59:56,760
<b>Now is not the time to...</b>

748
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:58,570
<b>Gosh, you jerk.</b>

749
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:03,440
<b>And he got in the way of the investigation and killed Ye Rim.</b>

750
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:04,809
<b>But he got promoted to a chief prosecutor.</b>

751
01:00:06,010 --> 01:00:07,539
<b>Prosecutor Woo is at the golf range.</b>

752
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:09,440
<b>He looks fine for now.</b>

753
01:00:11,150 --> 01:00:13,780
<b>You touched them both, but it can't be Choi Poong Won.</b>

754
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:15,679
<b>If it's after the full moon,</b>

755
01:00:16,449 --> 01:00:17,550
<b>it has to be Woo Seok Do.</b>

756
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:22,889
<b>What's wrong?</b>

757
01:00:23,389 --> 01:00:24,659
<b>Something doesn't feel right.</b>

758
01:00:25,690 --> 01:00:27,289
<b>It feels too easy.</b>

759
01:00:28,199 --> 01:00:29,460
<b>Because it's too obvious?</b>

760
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:32,999
<b>I feel like we missed something.</b>

761
01:00:36,170 --> 01:00:37,199
<b>Look.</b>

762
01:00:38,170 --> 01:00:39,210
<b>Here are the murder patterns.</b>

763
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:42,679
<b>Jin Jae Gyu always lured us with a hint.</b>

764
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:45,110
<b>He always left a hint next to the dead victims.</b>

765
01:00:47,849 --> 01:00:49,849
<b>We know who he is now, so maybe...</b>

766
01:00:49,849 --> 01:00:53,119
<b>No, this is very important to him.</b>

767
01:00:53,190 --> 01:00:56,420
<b>A perfect victory requires him to stick to the game rules.</b>

768
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:05,570
<b>The t-shirt worn by the victim covered in plaster.</b>

769
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:08,969
<b>"Hammer."</b>

770
01:01:11,909 --> 01:01:13,039
<b>Oh Yeon Tak.</b>

771
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:15,010
<b>Do you have photos of the crime scene?</b>

772
01:01:22,519 --> 01:01:23,820
<b>It wasn't Woo Seok Do either.</b>

773
01:01:27,090 --> 01:01:28,460
<b>He was also in contact with you.</b>

774
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:36,800
<b>- What? - Find his current location.</b>

775
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:38,570
<b>You heard her!</b>

776
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:41,170
<b>Triangulate his phone.</b>

777
01:01:44,639 --> 01:01:46,070
<b>Pick up!</b>

778
01:01:51,749 --> 01:01:52,849
<b>What...</b>

779
01:01:53,309 --> 01:01:54,420
<b>Stay away from me!</b>

780
01:01:54,980 --> 01:01:56,280
<b>Don't come closer.</b>

781
01:02:02,019 --> 01:02:04,019
<b>Don't you know who I am?</b>

782
01:02:04,389 --> 01:02:06,460
<b>I'm Jo Sung Dong, the leader of this nation's media.</b>

783
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:37,590
<b>Stop right there!</b>

784
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:41,099
<b>Hand above your head.</b>

785
01:02:43,230 --> 01:02:44,360
<b>Kneel.</b>

786
01:02:57,909 --> 01:03:00,480
<b>Move and this bullet goes in your skull.</b>

787
01:03:07,789 --> 01:03:08,920
<b>What are you doing?</b>

788
01:03:11,019 --> 01:03:12,130
<b>Get a grip on yourself!</b>

789
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:17,429
<b>Get your act together!</b>

790
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:52,530
<b>Hold on.</b>

791
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:58,409
<b>Where am I?</b>

792
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:07,309
<b>Yes, right here...</b>

793
01:05:13,010 --> 01:05:14,579
<b>The most crucial memory is gone.</b>

794
01:05:14,749 --> 01:05:16,019
<b>It's as if someone carved it out.</b>

795
01:05:16,449 --> 01:05:18,889
<b>Jin Jae Gyu has the power to erase memories.</b>

796
01:05:19,190 --> 01:05:20,449
<b>How did you motivate your accomplice?</b>

797
01:05:21,559 --> 01:05:23,719
<b>You're paying for sins tied to your blood.</b>

798
01:05:23,719 --> 01:05:24,929
<b>He's the demon.</b>

799
01:05:25,030 --> 01:05:26,059
<b>What could be his endgame?</b>

800
01:05:26,059 --> 01:05:28,499
<b>What is the picture he's drawing for us?</b>

801
01:05:28,499 --> 01:05:31,269
<b>Your filthy hands touched the boy.</b>

802
01:05:31,469 --> 01:05:34,230
<b>What if the third target isn't the boy?</b>

803
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:37,039
<b>No!</b>

804
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:39,369
<b>That only leaves me.</b>
