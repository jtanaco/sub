2
00:00:27,477 --> 00:00:29,980
<b>Look. There he is. The village idiot.</b>

3
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,240
<b>It's him. He followed me around all day.</b>

4
00:00:32,249 --> 00:00:34,275
<b>I can't believe he even followed me home.</b>

5
00:00:37,087 --> 00:00:38,605
<b>Who are you?</b>

6
00:00:39,856 --> 00:00:41,575
<b>Get out.</b>

7
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:44,860
<b>What? That's what I should be saying.</b>

8
00:00:44,861 --> 00:00:48,715
<b>My gosh, you're acting like you live here or something.</b>

9
00:00:58,375 --> 00:01:02,195
<b>Hello? I'm a little busy right now.</b>

10
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,410
<b>Actually, there's some guy...</b>

11
00:01:05,415 --> 00:01:07,875
<b>Did my son come home by any chance?</b>

12
00:01:08,085 --> 00:01:09,110
<b>What?</b>

13
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,280
<b>He sent me an email.</b>

14
00:01:11,288 --> 00:01:13,590
<b>He sent me a photo of the Uyuni Salt Flat in Bolivia...</b>

15
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:17,045
<b>and wrote "Going home" right beneath it.</b>

16
00:01:17,194 --> 00:01:19,215
<b>Isn't that so poetic?</b>

17
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:23,160
<b>He comes and goes whenever he wants without really saying anything.</b>

18
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:26,360
<b>And he comes in through the balcony instead of the front door.</b>

19
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:28,395
<b>So don't get too startled.</b>

20
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:33,670
<b>And unlike me, he has milky-white skin.</b>

21
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:36,165
<b>He's really dashing.</b>

22
00:01:37,114 --> 00:01:39,010
<b>You might get shocked by how good-looking he is.</b>

23
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:41,580
<b>Anyway, he doesn't have a cell phone,</b>

24
00:01:41,585 --> 00:01:43,480
<b>so let me know if he arrives.</b>

25
00:01:43,487 --> 00:01:46,605
<b>I think he's here already.</b>

26
00:01:55,298 --> 00:01:57,755
<b>Here. It's your mother.</b>

27
00:02:05,275 --> 00:02:09,035
<b>You made her worry. Don't try to avoid her.</b>

28
00:02:10,981 --> 00:02:12,380
<b>Hello?</b>

29
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:13,950
<b>- Guk Bong, is that you? - Well...</b>

30
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:16,920
<b>It's so hard to see you, my son.</b>

31
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,180
<b>Are you healthy?</b>

32
00:02:19,189 --> 00:02:22,490
<b>Send me some photos you took during your trip.</b>

33
00:02:22,492 --> 00:02:24,590
<b>- Well... - Oh, right.</b>

34
00:02:24,594 --> 00:02:27,985
<b>I sent you dried filefish fillet. Share them with Sol Ah.</b>

35
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:31,930
<b>Will you answer me? Why aren't you saying anything?</b>

36
00:02:31,935 --> 00:02:34,930
<b>You love dried filefish fillet. It's dried fish.</b>

37
00:02:34,938 --> 00:02:36,965
<b>Well, yes.</b>

38
00:02:38,008 --> 00:02:39,400
<b>Let me introduce him to you.</b>

39
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,835
<b>Did you introduce yourself to Sol Ah?</b>

40
00:02:42,779 --> 00:02:44,940
<b>What am I supposed to call him?</b>

41
00:02:44,948 --> 00:02:46,880
<b>Like I told you before,</b>

42
00:02:46,883 --> 00:02:50,105
<b>you guys may be the same age, but you were born earlier.</b>

43
00:02:51,154 --> 00:02:53,815
<b>You're older?</b>

<b>(Quote by David Levy)</b>

47
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:17,640
<b>Your name is Guk Bong, right?</b>

48
00:03:17,647 --> 00:03:19,610
<b>I heard you use your mother's last name,</b>

49
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:21,310
<b>so that means your name is...</b>

50
00:03:21,318 --> 00:03:24,320
<b>Bang Guk Bong.</b>

51
00:03:24,321 --> 00:03:25,750
<b>No.</b>

52

<b>Don't you like your name? Bang Guk Bong?</b>

53

<b>Don't call me that.</b>

54
00:03:31,928 --> 00:03:33,990
<b>Why are you talking to me like I'm your friend?</b>

55
00:03:33,997 --> 00:03:35,560
<b>Can you keep your manners?</b>

56
00:03:35,565 --> 00:03:37,300
<b>Things are already pretty awkward between us.</b>

57
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,460
<b>You secretly watched me...</b>

58
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:42,270
<b>without even telling me who you are.</b>

59
00:03:42,272 --> 00:03:44,170
<b>That's not even funny.</b>

60
00:03:44,174 --> 00:03:47,310
<b>I didn't move in here because I wanted to.</b>

61
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,740
<b>And I pay rent even though it might not be that much.</b>

62
00:03:49,746 --> 00:03:52,840
<b>So you can't just show up and kick my friend out like that.</b>

63
00:03:52,849 --> 00:03:54,905
<b>- "Friend"? - Yes.</b>

64
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:58,245
<b>- He's my friend. - You guys...</b>

65

<b>aren't friends.</b>

66

<b>Do you think you're my older brother or something?</b>

67
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,815
<b>You keep talking to me without honorifics.</b>

68
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:12,000
<b>Okay, fine. Let's talk comfortably if that's what you want.</b>

71

<b>I left him outside the balcony.</b>

72
00:04:19,075 --> 00:04:20,765
<b>Did you see him on your way in?</b>

73
00:04:22,145 --> 00:04:24,105
<b>Did you leave the folding door open?</b>

74

<b>My gosh.</b>

75
00:04:30,153 --> 00:04:31,775

80

<b>What?</b>

81
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,735
<b>Did he go upstairs?</b>

82
00:04:57,747 --> 00:05:01,075
<b>I have a bad feeling about the new house.</b>

83

<b>I think that guy...</b>

<b>is a cat.</b>

85

<b>"A cat"?</b>

86
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:13,085
<b>For some reason, so many people around me are like cats.</b>

87
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,255
<b>What did you spill on your jacket?</b>

88
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:24,025
<b>You kind of smell funny.</b>

89

<b>This?</b>

90

<b>If you're hungry, let's have breakfast.</b>

91

<b>Can you make some toast?</b>

92
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:07,850
<b>What an interesting guy.</b>

93
00:06:07,851 --> 00:06:09,950
<b>He's like a kid. I feel like I should take care of him.</b>

94
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:11,445
<b>Forget about that.</b>

95
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:12,750
<b>You've always been taking care of your dad.</b>

96
00:06:12,756 --> 00:06:13,790
<b>And now, you're even going to take care...</b>

97
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,275
<b>of your dad's girlfriend's son?</b>

98
00:06:15,592 --> 00:06:18,445
<b>That's why you always get involved with people need care...</b>

99
00:06:19,062 --> 00:06:20,855
<b>and don't have anyone who takes care of you.</b>

100
00:06:22,198 --> 00:06:23,615
<b>Take this.</b>

101
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,230
<b>What?</b>

102
00:06:25,235 --> 00:06:28,425
<b>Your so-called brother left it here.</b>

103
00:06:30,273 --> 00:06:32,925
<b>He did? This is my umbrella.</b>

104
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,135
<b>Why would he use my stuff?</b>

105
00:06:35,578 --> 00:06:38,905
<b>See? Guk Bong does whatever he wants.</b>

106
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:42,910
<b>I wonder if I should move out and get a new place.</b>

107
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:44,280
<b>Why would you move out?</b>

108
00:06:44,287 --> 00:06:47,645
<b>Don't even think about it. Let me see that guy in person.</b>

109

<b>Jae Seon, do you have time this evening?</b>

110
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:53,485
<b>This guy might really be a freak.</b>

111
00:06:54,731 --> 00:06:56,615
<b>I guess I could close early today.</b>

112
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:58,125
<b>Okay.</b>

113
00:06:58,701 --> 00:07:02,455
<b>We'll go there and intimidate that guy.</b>

114

<b>You're going to come to my place?</b>

<b>I'm not Bang Guk Bong.</b>

<b>Hey, Guk Bong.</b>

117

<b>My friends are coming over tonight. Is that okay with you?</b>

118

<b>"Friends"?</b>

<b>You mean that guy?</b>

<b>That's actually why I'm cleaning. Can you help me take out the trash?</b>

121

<b>I also need to go grocery shopping.</b>

122
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,445
<b>What was that?</b>

123
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:56,050
<b>You need to step on plastic bottles and cans...</b>

124

<b>so that they don't take up too much space.</b>

<b>Then you just put them in the box.</b>

126

<b>There.</b>

127

<b>What? Do you also need something?</b>

131

<b>- You're allergic. - I took some medicine.</b>

161
00:10:46,162 --> 00:10:48,515
<b>This is what you call true love.</b>

162
00:10:52,368 --> 00:10:54,395
<b>I guess we both struggle...</b>

163

<b>with love.</b>

164
00:10:56,606 --> 00:10:58,325
<b>- What? - What?</b>

165
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:01,035
<b>That must be Doo Sik.</b>

166
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,735
<b>Hey. Where is he?</b>

167
00:11:07,116 --> 00:11:08,780
<b>Where is he?</b>

168
00:11:08,785 --> 00:11:10,845
<b>Why do you look like that?</b>

169
00:11:11,654 --> 00:11:13,175
<b>To intimidate him.</b>

170
00:11:13,856 --> 00:11:15,050
<b>Mr. Bang Guk Bong.</b>

171
00:11:15,058 --> 00:11:17,760
<b>I came to say hello. Why don't you come down here?</b>

172
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,315
<b>- He's not home right now. - What?</b>

173
00:11:21,531 --> 00:11:23,585
<b>He got scared, didn't he?</b>

174
00:11:23,633 --> 00:11:25,185
<b>Gosh, it's hot.</b>

175
00:11:34,243 --> 00:11:37,735
<b>Remember when you fainted after the pirate ship ride?</b>

176
00:11:37,814 --> 00:11:39,140
<b>You fainted right next to me.</b>

177
00:11:39,148 --> 00:11:41,310
<b>I told you what you need to do to not get scared.</b>

178
00:11:41,317 --> 00:11:44,445
<b>I know, but I was still scared.</b>

179
00:11:47,023 --> 00:11:49,820
<b>Jae Seon, you still wear that ring?</b>

180
00:11:49,826 --> 00:11:51,315
<b>Well, yes.</b>

181
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:54,060
<b>This is the art club ring.</b>

182
00:11:54,063 --> 00:11:55,460
<b>I still have it.</b>

183
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:58,000
<b>I bet you do.</b>

184
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,825
<b>You cherished it more than your own life.</b>

185
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,255
<b>Do you remember?</b>

186
00:12:02,371 --> 00:12:03,840
<b>- The ski resort? - Yes.</b>

187
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,670
<b>She fell while snowboarding and broke her finger.</b>

188
00:12:06,676 --> 00:12:09,710
<b>Her finger turned purple because it was so swollen.</b>

189
00:12:09,712 --> 00:12:12,310
<b>But when we tried to cut the ring, she threw a fit and told us...</b>

190
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:14,105
<b>- to cut her finger instead. - Hey, hey.</b>

191
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,380
<b>It wasn't even a promise ring. It was just a friendship ring.</b>

192
00:12:16,385 --> 00:12:18,505
<b>- That's enough. - Fine.</b>

193
00:12:19,188 --> 00:12:20,805
<b>Do whatever you want.</b>

194
00:12:21,891 --> 00:12:24,420
<b>- Where are you going? - Where are you going? You're drunk.</b>

195
00:12:24,427 --> 00:12:26,185
<b>Let me take a tour around the house.</b>

196
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:35,955
<b>Is this the bathroom?</b>

197
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:40,965
<b>Sorry.</b>

198
00:12:46,115 --> 00:12:48,675
<b>Wait a minute. Was that him?</b>

199
00:12:50,319 --> 00:12:52,845
<b>Hey, you're here. Why didn't you...</b>

200
00:12:59,162 --> 00:13:00,955
<b>What's wrong with this house?</b>

201
00:13:06,235 --> 00:13:07,755
<b>I need to pee.</b>

202
00:13:24,854 --> 00:13:27,075
<b>I haven't seen you laugh like this in a long time.</b>

203
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,350
<b>Really?</b>

204
00:13:29,358 --> 00:13:32,915
<b>No one else other than us can make you laugh like this.</b>

205
00:13:34,263 --> 00:13:35,785
<b>You're right.</b>

206
00:13:39,335 --> 00:13:41,855
<b>Things are finally back to normal.</b>

207
00:13:44,273 --> 00:13:45,695
<b>I agree.</b>

208
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:49,235
<b>Why did you run away...</b>

209
00:13:50,112 --> 00:13:51,705
<b>if you were going to come back like this?</b>

210
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:58,105
<b>You really know how to put on an innocent face.</b>

211
00:14:01,724 --> 00:14:03,915
<b>I'm sure you remember what happened between us.</b>

212
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:21,465
<b>You have to go to work.</b>

213
00:14:21,811 --> 00:14:23,365
<b>Yes.</b>

214
00:14:24,847 --> 00:14:27,705
<b>I think something just happened.</b>

215
00:14:28,517 --> 00:14:30,775
<b>Did something happen?</b>

216
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:35,375
<b>Something definitely happened.</b>

<b>I'll pick you up from home.</b>

220

<b>What?</b>

221
00:14:46,669 --> 00:14:49,295
<b>Is this getting out of hand?</b>

222
00:14:51,007 --> 00:14:53,465
<b>Maybe. And it looks bad.</b>

223
00:14:55,945 --> 00:14:57,140

<b>(Where are you? Is something wrong?)</b>

229

<b>It was a legendarily cold night.</b>

230
00:15:34,951 --> 00:15:38,745
<b>The cold showed up instead of the guy I was waiting for.</b>

231

<b>Sorry.</b>

232

<b>You apologize so indifferently.</b>

<b>Do you want to feel so indifferent?</b>

234

<b>So nothing will happen to your life?</b>

236

<b>You ran off to another woman...</b>

237
00:16:01,077 --> 00:16:03,295

340
00:24:16,505 --> 00:24:18,525

477
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:10,550
<b>I'll order you a coffee.</b>

478
00:35:10,558 --> 00:35:12,245
<b>- Get over here. - But...</b>

479
00:35:14,329 --> 00:35:16,085
<b>He's so stubborn.</b>

480
00:35:21,636 --> 00:35:24,125
<b>Hong Jo, I'm going out.</b>

481
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:49,290
<b>You're here.</b>

482
00:35:49,297 --> 00:35:52,355
<b>Yes. Doo Sik said he's bringing some of our colleagues.</b>

483
00:35:53,801 --> 00:35:56,855
<b>- They're here. - Jae Seon, I brought guests.</b>

484
00:35:57,472 --> 00:35:59,895
<b>They work with me at Nalsaem Design.</b>

485
00:35:59,974 --> 00:36:01,700
<b>He's my friend. He owns the place.</b>

486
00:36:01,709 --> 00:36:03,670
<b>You're so handsome.</b>

487
00:36:03,678 --> 00:36:05,865
<b>This cafe is so beautiful.</b>

488
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,210
<b>Are those leather items handmade?</b>

489
00:36:08,216 --> 00:36:09,675
<b>Oh, yes.</b>

490
00:36:09,851 --> 00:36:11,950
<b>- Do you guys want some coffee? - Sure.</b>

491
00:36:11,953 --> 00:36:13,750
<b>- What will you have? - An Americano?</b>

492
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:16,245
<b>- Me too. - Coming right up.</b>

493
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:18,875
<b>Please have some.</b>

494
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:22,690
<b>Then are you three friends from the high school art club?</b>

495
00:36:22,697 --> 00:36:25,700
<b>Yes. Our art club was famous.</b>

496
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:28,330
<b>We won all the medals at the national art competition.</b>

497
00:36:28,336 --> 00:36:30,700
<b>Sol Ah won bronze, Jae Seon won silver...</b>

498
00:36:30,705 --> 00:36:32,900
<b>Wait. Who won the gold medal?</b>

499
00:36:32,907 --> 00:36:34,670
<b>I don't know. Was it someone from our school?</b>

500
00:36:34,676 --> 00:36:36,740
<b>Why don't you know? You don't remember?</b>

501
00:36:36,744 --> 00:36:39,080
<b>You know, that person. It was that...</b>

502
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:42,710
<b>Oh, it seems like my memory is coming back. It was a guy, right?</b>

503
00:36:42,717 --> 00:36:44,310
<b>Yes, right. A guy.</b>

504
00:36:44,319 --> 00:36:47,080
<b>Right. Wasn't he a year older than us?</b>

505
00:36:47,088 --> 00:36:48,420
<b>- Right? - Yes, yes!</b>

506
00:36:48,423 --> 00:36:50,450
<b>- I remember now. - You're right.</b>

507
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:52,090
<b>He was older. He was a big guy too.</b>

508
00:36:52,093 --> 00:36:54,560
<b>- Right. Man, you're really smart. - I know.</b>

509
00:36:54,562 --> 00:36:57,655
<b>Hold on. But what was his name?</b>

510
00:36:57,665 --> 00:37:00,160
<b>Name? His name was...</b>

511
00:37:00,168 --> 00:37:01,725
<b>She's right there.</b>

512
00:37:03,504 --> 00:37:04,925
<b>What?</b>

513
00:37:06,541 --> 00:37:07,965
<b>What?</b>

514
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,980
<b>- Ji Eun. - How long was she sitting there?</b>

515
00:37:15,984 --> 00:37:17,280
<b>I just got goosebumps.</b>

516
00:37:17,285 --> 00:37:19,345
<b>How do you know Ji Eun?</b>

517
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:21,975
<b>She was in our art club too.</b>

518
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:24,290
<b>I didn't know she worked with you.</b>

519
00:37:24,292 --> 00:37:26,120
<b>She was in our art club?</b>

520
00:37:26,127 --> 00:37:29,255
<b>The one who won the gold medal?</b>

521
00:37:32,267 --> 00:37:33,755
<b>Oh, that...</b>

522
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:36,130
<b>I... No, I mean...</b>

523
00:37:36,137 --> 00:37:39,895
<b>See? She said no. You don't even know.</b>

524
00:37:41,643 --> 00:37:44,165
<b>No, that's not what I meant...</b>

525
00:37:44,279 --> 00:37:46,505
<b>She means she didn't win the gold medal.</b>

526
00:37:46,881 --> 00:37:50,905
<b>If she didn't win the gold medal...</b>

527
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:10,455
<b>The Grand Prize.</b>

528
00:38:17,078 --> 00:38:18,535
<b>What...</b>

529
00:38:23,951 --> 00:38:25,745
<b>You're drawing Beodul Love again?</b>

530
00:38:26,287 --> 00:38:29,415
<b>- You have such elegant taste. - What's wrong with that?</b>

531
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:31,550
<b>Beodul Love is my ideal type.</b>

532
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:33,145
<b>You knew, right?</b>

533
00:38:33,861 --> 00:38:34,860
<b>What?</b>

534
00:38:34,862 --> 00:38:37,415
<b>That we were in the same art club at high school.</b>

535
00:38:37,632 --> 00:38:39,455
<b>Why didn't you tell us?</b>

536
00:38:43,771 --> 00:38:46,395
<b>- I did. - What?</b>

537
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:57,835
<b>I know what Beodul Love is too.</b>

538
00:38:58,019 --> 00:39:00,305
<b>It's about my webtoon.</b>

539
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:05,075
<b>I know what that ring is too.</b>

540
00:39:05,793 --> 00:39:09,785
<b>I was in the same art club as you guys in high school.</b>

541
00:39:11,866 --> 00:39:13,725
<b>Do you see this ring?</b>

542
00:39:13,901 --> 00:39:16,295
<b>We were in the same art club.</b>

543
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:20,365
<b>It's true! The ring.</b>

544
00:39:24,145 --> 00:39:27,405
<b>Eun Ji Eun. You're that Eun Ji Eun.</b>

545
00:39:27,415 --> 00:39:30,105
<b>Now I remember. You wore glasses, right?</b>

546
00:39:30,985 --> 00:39:33,345
<b>I have perfect eyesight.</b>

547
00:39:35,757 --> 00:39:38,845
<b>Right, not glasses, but you had braces.</b>

548
00:39:39,227 --> 00:39:40,885
<b>You wore braces, right?</b>

549
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:45,255
<b>I have healthy teeth.</b>

550
00:39:46,033 --> 00:39:47,100
<b>She transferred to another school,</b>

551
00:39:47,101 --> 00:39:49,195
<b>so we didn't have time to become friends.</b>

552
00:39:49,704 --> 00:39:51,295
<b>Or did you transfer to our school?</b>

553
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:54,795
<b>- You don't remember, do you? - No.</b>

554
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:58,010
<b>Well, I can't remember all of my friends from high school either.</b>

555
00:39:58,012 --> 00:40:00,735
<b>- Right. - Anyhow, what a coincidence.</b>

556
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:04,405
<b>But Jae Seon, how did you know?</b>

557
00:40:07,455 --> 00:40:10,075
<b>This is the Lee Jae Seon that I like.</b>

558
00:40:10,725 --> 00:40:13,045
<b>He seems cold and indifferent,</b>

559
00:40:13,194 --> 00:40:15,285
<b>but actually, he's watching everything.</b>

560
00:40:16,431 --> 00:40:19,925
<b>Even things other people overlook, so meticulously.</b>

561
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:23,795
<b>Like a cat.</b>

562
00:40:33,381 --> 00:40:36,505
<b>I'm sure he saw my webtoon too.</b>

563
00:40:36,584 --> 00:40:38,450
<b>Sol Ah, why aren't you uploading...</b>

564
00:40:38,453 --> 00:40:40,145
<b>the next episode of "Helpless Beodul Love"?</b>

565
00:40:40,154 --> 00:40:41,150
<b>What?</b>

566
00:40:41,155 --> 00:40:44,445
<b>I'm curious why Beodul Love suddenly closed the door.</b>

567
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,660
<b>That's...</b>

568
00:40:46,661 --> 00:40:49,615
<b>It's obvious. Since he doesn't like her.</b>

569
00:40:49,931 --> 00:40:52,860
<b>There could be another reason. They even kissed.</b>

570
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:54,730
<b>The reason isn't important.</b>

571
00:40:54,735 --> 00:40:55,870
<b>He said no,</b>

572
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:58,030
<b>but continuing to ask him why is so annoying. Isn't it?</b>

573
00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:00,500
<b>That's true. Not accepting the fact she was rejected...</b>

574
00:41:00,508 --> 00:41:02,940
<b>and continuing to knock on the door is a bit inappropriate.</b>

575
00:41:02,944 --> 00:41:06,280
<b>She will become more mature in the next episode, right?</b>

576
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,805
<b>Instead of waiting in front of that door pathetically?</b>

577
00:41:09,517 --> 00:41:11,035
<b>I'm not sure.</b>

578
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:15,275
<b>Why? I like a woman who looks after me.</b>

579
00:41:21,963 --> 00:41:24,485
<b>Jae Seon, did you see Sol Ah's webtoon?</b>

580
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:43,580
<b>(Why won't he open up?)</b>

581
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:45,605
<b>(I wonder if he isn't cold.)</b>

582
00:42:02,203 --> 00:42:04,725
<b>I'm hoping it's a different story.</b>

583
00:42:05,973 --> 00:42:10,095
<b>It seems like you're too obsessed with the story about Beodul Love.</b>

584
00:42:10,978 --> 00:42:15,105
<b>I'm sure the Kim Sol Ah I know can tell a different story.</b>

585
00:42:16,417 --> 00:42:17,935
<b>I'm just hoping.</b>

586
00:42:19,053 --> 00:42:21,850
<b>That's what I was thinking. It's too cliche.</b>

587
00:42:21,856 --> 00:42:25,245
<b>An obvious fantasy where a girl gets saved by a guy?</b>

588
00:42:26,861 --> 00:42:28,715
<b>That's not the story.</b>

589
00:42:29,196 --> 00:42:30,715
<b>Hey.</b>

590
00:42:30,865 --> 00:42:32,500
<b>I just opened it up now,</b>

591
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:35,225
<b>and her views increased, and there are even comments.</b>

592
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:42,470
<b>(Look at the number of views. The writer is crying right now.)</b>

593
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:44,640
<b>(That girl is such an annoying character.)</b>

594
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:46,880
<b>(My 9-year-old daughter loves this story.)</b>

595
00:42:46,881 --> 00:42:49,575
<b>(Please keep your childish diary to yourself.)</b>

596
00:42:56,424 --> 00:43:00,545
<b>Something came up at home, so I have to get going.</b>

597
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:03,285
<b>Sol Ah...</b>

598
00:43:27,755 --> 00:43:29,245
<b>Hey, you.</b>

599
00:43:30,558 --> 00:43:31,975
<b>Stop looking at it.</b>

600
00:43:33,928 --> 00:43:37,330
<b>It's just an obvious fantasy.</b>

601
00:43:37,331 --> 00:43:39,330
<b>A man saving a woman.</b>

602
00:43:39,333 --> 00:43:42,255
<b>It's actually Beodul Love who was saved.</b>

603
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:45,895
<b>To save him from being locked in the cave,</b>

604
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:48,925
<b>the girl visits every day in the cold winter...</b>

605
00:43:49,644 --> 00:43:51,735
<b>to knock on the door.</b>

606
00:43:57,718 --> 00:43:59,975
<b>Do you want a drink?</b>

607
00:44:07,695 --> 00:44:10,555
<b>It's lactose-free milk because of the cat. Do you mind?</b>

608
00:44:17,338 --> 00:44:18,755
<b>So,</b>

609
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:21,695
<b>where did you get that idea?</b>

610
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:30,475
<b>You're just like Hong Jo.</b>

611
00:44:32,153 --> 00:44:35,745
<b>Where did you usually stay?</b>

612
00:44:36,023 --> 00:44:37,675
<b>By the window.</b>

613
00:44:38,426 --> 00:44:42,045
<b>No, I mean, where was the favorite place you visited?</b>

614
00:44:43,531 --> 00:44:45,185
<b>The roof.</b>

615
00:44:48,335 --> 00:44:50,625
<b>You know more than you show.</b>

616
00:44:51,005 --> 00:44:53,140
<b>I thought you were an idiot.</b>

617
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:55,240
<b>It's the guy who was here, right?</b>

618
00:44:55,242 --> 00:44:56,835
<b>Beodul Love.</b>

619
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:03,475
<b>You know things you don't need to.</b>

620
00:45:04,351 --> 00:45:06,375
<b>(Why won't he open up?)</b>

621
00:45:32,947 --> 00:45:36,065
<b>Go to work. See you this evening.</b>

622
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:38,205
<b>I'll pick you up from home.</b>

623
00:46:53,127 --> 00:46:55,585
<b>(Sol Ah)</b>

00:48:06,901 --> 00:48:09,755
<b>You promised to meet and he disappeared?</b>

632
00:48:09,937 --> 00:48:12,325
<b>Just like Beodul Love?</b>

633
00:48:13,107 --> 00:48:15,495
<b>How much do you want to know?</b>

634
00:48:16,010 --> 00:48:19,535
<b>Without an explanation or greeting?</b>

635
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:25,975
<b>He had met someone else.</b>

636
00:48:27,254 --> 00:48:29,675
<b>That was the explanation and greeting.</b>

637
00:48:30,691 --> 00:48:32,990
<b>Why do you like someone like him?</b>

638
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:35,885
<b>It wasn't one-sided from my part.</b>

639
00:48:35,930 --> 00:48:39,485
<b>Jae Seon does disappear when he wants to sometimes,</b>

640
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:42,130
<b>but he always comes back.</b>

641
00:48:42,136 --> 00:48:44,395
<b>Did he come back?</b>

642
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:46,440
<b>What?</b>

643
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,295
<b>Isn't it you...</b>

644
00:48:48,542 --> 00:48:50,065
<b>that came back?</b>

645
00:48:54,515 --> 00:48:56,035
<b>No.</b>

646
00:48:56,951 --> 00:48:59,080
<b>We're a bit like that.</b>

647
00:48:59,086 --> 00:49:01,620
<b>Like planets that can't stay away from each other.</b>

648
00:49:01,622 --> 00:49:04,115
<b>But you can't get closer either.</b>

649
00:49:05,592 --> 00:49:07,945
<b>Did you always come back...</b>

650
00:49:08,595 --> 00:49:10,815
<b>to orbit around him?</b>

651
00:49:14,001 --> 00:49:15,555
<b>Yes.</b>

652
00:49:16,337 --> 00:49:18,025
<b>You're right.</b>

653
00:49:18,739 --> 00:49:20,625
<b>I'm a puppy.</b>

654
00:49:27,314 --> 00:49:29,950
<b>He took me far away and left me there,</b>

655
00:49:29,950 --> 00:49:32,410
<b>and I came back, wagging my tail.</b>

656
00:49:32,419 --> 00:49:35,375
<b>Waiting by the door, asking to be let in.</b>

657
00:49:35,689 --> 00:49:37,820
<b>I'm a little dog.</b>

658
00:49:37,825 --> 00:49:40,945
<b>He'll keep you waiting by the door.</b>

659
00:49:41,028 --> 00:49:43,285
<b>He won't let you in.</b>

660
00:49:43,797 --> 00:49:46,115
<b>You came back to him,</b>

661
00:49:46,834 --> 00:49:48,885
<b>and he isn't thankful at all.</b>

662
00:50:06,053 --> 00:50:07,675
<b>What's the matter?</b>

663
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:18,215
<b>Why are you...</b>

664
00:50:18,532 --> 00:50:20,855
<b>leaving me by the door?</b>

665
00:50:24,171 --> 00:50:26,340
<b>Come in whenever you want.</b>

666
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:29,100
<b>Let me in or send me away. Do just one thing.</b>

667
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:31,040
<b>If you're a friend, stay a friend.</b>

668
00:50:31,045 --> 00:50:34,305
<b>Don't check my temperature and get me medicine like a boyfriend.</b>

669
00:50:35,082 --> 00:50:37,475
<b>If you're sick of being Beodul Love,</b>

670
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:40,545
<b>don't act like Beodul Love.</b>

671
00:50:41,588 --> 00:50:44,545
<b>Let's talk inside. I felt bothered about...</b>

672
00:50:44,858 --> 00:50:47,260
<b>what I'd said about your webtoon.</b>

673
00:50:47,261 --> 00:50:48,915
<b>Exactly.</b>

674
00:50:51,698 --> 00:50:54,155
<b>You should've been more clear.</b>

675
00:50:54,835 --> 00:50:57,695
<b>"The kiss was a mistake. I take it back."</b>

676
00:50:58,372 --> 00:51:00,965
<b>I'd have gotten the hint if you'd made it simple.</b>

677
00:51:02,076 --> 00:51:05,095
<b>"Only you can be Kim Sol Ah. There's just one of you."</b>

678
00:51:05,579 --> 00:51:07,835
<b>Why did you confuse me?</b>

679
00:51:10,617 --> 00:51:12,875
<b>It's true that you're special.</b>

680
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,580
<b>Let's go back to...</b>

681
00:51:15,589 --> 00:51:17,115
<b>where we were.</b>

682
00:51:17,591 --> 00:51:19,615
<b>Where we were?</b>

683
00:51:21,261 --> 00:51:22,945
<b>I can't do that.</b>

684
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:27,555
<b>Something hit me.</b>

685
00:51:29,536 --> 00:51:33,070
<b>I'm always in the same place, looking at you.</b>

686
00:51:33,073 --> 00:51:34,795
<b>That's it.</b>

687
00:51:34,908 --> 00:51:37,935
<b>That must be why you think it's okay to run away.</b>

688
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:41,435
<b>Because you can always come back to me.</b>

689
00:51:43,484 --> 00:51:45,835
<b>I knew you for a long time.</b>

690
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:47,975
<b>Or rather...</b>

691
00:51:48,789 --> 00:51:50,945
<b>I thought I knew you.</b>

692
00:51:53,127 --> 00:51:55,715
<b>I thought it was right for me at least...</b>

693
00:51:55,729 --> 00:51:57,855
<b>to protect you.</b>

694
00:51:59,066 --> 00:52:01,655
<b>I think I made you run away.</b>

695
00:52:02,136 --> 00:52:04,495
<b>- It's not like that. - Then...</b>

696
00:52:04,938 --> 00:52:06,725
<b>what's your reason?</b>

697
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:09,995
<b>Why is it not me?</b>

698
00:52:14,948 --> 00:52:16,575
<b>The scarf.</b>

699
00:52:17,818 --> 00:52:18,880
<b>What?</b>

700
00:52:18,886 --> 00:52:20,975
<b>The scarf you always wore.</b>

701
00:52:21,722 --> 00:52:23,315
<b>Where is it?</b>

702
00:52:23,824 --> 00:52:25,350
<b>What about it?</b>

703
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:26,520
<b>Did you throw it away?</b>

704
00:52:26,527 --> 00:52:28,885
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

705
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:32,185
<b>Are you changing the subject?</b>

706
00:52:36,603 --> 00:52:38,000
<b>Forget it.</b>

707
00:52:38,005 --> 00:52:40,965
<b>Why won't you continue? Talk to me.</b>

708
00:52:43,310 --> 00:52:46,265
<b>Quit running away and tell the truth.</b>

709
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:48,665
<b>Why can't it be me?</b>

710
00:52:49,716 --> 00:52:52,675
<b>Why can't I mean anything to you?</b>

711
00:52:54,621 --> 00:52:56,175
<b>Tell me.</b>

712
00:52:57,724 --> 00:53:01,085
<b>Please, tell me so I can understand.</b>

713
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:05,730
<b>Let's stop.</b>

714
00:53:05,732 --> 00:53:07,955
<b>I'm trying to stop.</b>

715
00:53:11,138 --> 00:53:12,955
<b>Your silence.</b>

716
00:53:14,241 --> 00:53:17,295
<b>It used to comfort me, but not anymore.</b>

717
00:53:19,046 --> 00:53:21,205
<b>I won't be a puppy anymore.</b>

718
00:53:22,082 --> 00:53:24,175
<b>I'm no longer a dog.</b>

719
00:54:07,427 --> 00:54:09,045
<b>She abandoned you.</b>

720
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:35,875
<b>(Sol Ah)</b>

721
00:54:56,910 --> 00:55:01,705
<b>(Take him if you want.)</b>

722
00:55:05,218 --> 00:55:07,875
<b>(Sol Ah)</b>

723
00:55:54,067 --> 00:55:55,655
<b>Hong Jo.</b>

724
00:55:57,671 --> 00:56:01,395
<b>No cat would hug someone for being in pain.</b>

725
00:56:28,769 --> 00:56:30,395
<b>A human...</b>

726
00:56:37,911 --> 00:56:39,535
<b>can hug.</b>

727
00:58:07,968 --> 00:58:10,795
<b>(Juniel's "Fall in Love" has been released.)</b>

728
00:58:22,449 --> 00:58:25,210
<b>(Meow, the Secret Boy)</b>

729
00:58:25,218 --> 00:58:27,905
<b>How can I become a real human?</b>

730
00:58:28,455 --> 00:58:30,490
<b>I'll set Sol Ah up with a guy.</b>

731
00:58:30,490 --> 00:58:31,590
<b>What's he like?</b>

732
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:33,050
<b>Like a dog, he likes only me.</b>

733
00:58:33,059 --> 00:58:35,915
<b>He looks at, follows, and waits only for me.</b>

734
00:58:36,129 --> 00:58:38,255
<b>I found someone who'll take the cat.</b>

735
00:58:39,366 --> 00:58:42,085
<b>- What if he comes back? - I'll send him back.</b>

736
00:58:42,269 --> 00:58:43,970
<b>There's only one way.</b>

737
00:58:43,970 --> 00:58:45,500
<b>What does that mean?</b>

738
00:58:45,505 --> 00:58:49,395
<b>Cats are like that. When it's time to leave, they leave voluntarily.</b>

739
00:58:50,277 --> 00:58:52,595
<b>What do you choose?</b>
