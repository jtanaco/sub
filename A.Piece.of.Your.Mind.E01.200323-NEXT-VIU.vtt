00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:50.516
Do you remember this song?

00:00:50.642 --> 00:00:52.451
Erik Satie's "Je te veux".

00:00:52.451 --> 00:00:54.882
It was composed in 1891...

00:00:54.882 --> 00:00:56.056
Stop.

00:00:57.902 --> 00:00:59.316
Stop the music.

00:01:04.171 --> 00:01:05.212
(Ha Won)

00:01:05.212 --> 00:01:06.781
Who are you?

00:01:06.781 --> 00:01:08.427
I am Ha Won.

00:01:09.581 --> 00:01:11.796
No, no.

00:01:12.182 --> 00:01:15.522
If I ask Ha Won who he is,

00:01:15.522 --> 00:01:18.191
he should get annoyed and ask...

00:01:18.191 --> 00:01:21.762
if something's wrong with me. That's how Ha Won would react,

00:01:21.762 --> 00:01:24.876
not "I am Ha Won."

00:01:25.301 --> 00:01:26.837
Listen up.

00:01:28.001 --> 00:01:31.941
You are a conversation device with Ha Won's character and emotions.

00:01:31.941 --> 00:01:35.811
So you need to carry on a conversation like him.

00:01:35.811 --> 00:01:38.457
You're worse than Siri right now.

00:01:39.482 --> 00:01:41.186
I hurt your pride, right?

00:01:41.281 --> 00:01:43.356
Mine is hurt too.

00:01:44.281 --> 00:01:47.220
Why won't he come in? It has been days already.

00:01:47.221 --> 00:01:49.567
Please ask one question at a time.

00:01:49.921 --> 00:01:51.367
Enough.

00:01:51.822 --> 00:01:53.622
You scared me. What's up?

00:01:53.622 --> 00:01:55.691
I'm sure I heard Chief Ha Won's voice.

00:01:55.691 --> 00:01:57.136
He's over there.

00:01:58.001 --> 00:01:59.402
I haven't seen that before.

00:01:59.402 --> 00:02:02.046
Are you two developing something alone again?

00:02:02.201 --> 00:02:03.572
When will you share it with us?

00:02:03.572 --> 00:02:05.947
It's not good enough yet.

00:02:06.842 --> 00:02:08.087
Get to the meeting.

00:02:09.272 --> 00:02:11.311
They connected DNA and the medical field...

00:02:11.311 --> 00:02:13.941
to create "network medicine".

00:02:13.941 --> 00:02:15.486
- Here. - AH...

00:02:15.712 --> 00:02:17.112
- uses AI... - Thanks.

00:02:17.112 --> 00:02:21.022
and leads the medical research platform industry.

00:02:21.022 --> 00:02:22.266
Pause.

00:02:23.191 --> 00:02:24.321
Remove my image.

00:02:24.321 --> 00:02:26.922
The hospital requested that we include it.

00:02:26.922 --> 00:02:28.236
Remove it.

00:02:29.432 --> 00:02:31.576
I'll replace it with Mr. Kim's image.

00:02:33.631 --> 00:02:36.546
And leads the medical research platform industry.

00:02:37.631 --> 00:02:40.401
The previous one looked much better.

00:02:40.402 --> 00:02:42.447
But it looks credible.

00:02:43.011 --> 00:02:45.381
What's the accuracy for the psychological evaluation?

00:02:45.381 --> 00:02:47.086
It's 93 percent.

00:02:47.212 --> 00:02:49.911
If an AI can diagnose patients at a 93-percent accuracy,

00:02:49.911 --> 00:02:51.757
that's practically the best in the world.

00:02:55.851 --> 00:02:58.592
What? Your character and emotions?

00:02:58.592 --> 00:03:01.667
As if. Not even close.

00:03:04.332 --> 00:03:05.676
Look.

00:03:06.202 --> 00:03:09.601
Up until now, computers were adapted...

00:03:09.601 --> 00:03:12.576
to individuals using the average person's emotions.

00:03:12.672 --> 00:03:15.811
But you inputted an individual's emotions into that.

00:03:15.811 --> 00:03:18.687
This is a huge accomplishment. Seriously.

00:03:19.041 --> 00:03:20.556
But it won't work.

00:03:21.682 --> 00:03:23.781
The only way is through dialogue.

00:03:23.781 --> 00:03:25.952
It wouldn't work with me, so I thought it would work with you.

00:03:25.952 --> 00:03:28.492
It won't work. I took that with me everywhere...

00:03:28.492 --> 00:03:31.592
and talked to it for four days straight.

00:03:31.592 --> 00:03:33.191
We haven't found the point of reaction yet.

00:03:33.191 --> 00:03:35.862
Exactly. What exactly is the point of reaction?

00:03:35.862 --> 00:03:40.176
When and how, at what point will it become you?

00:03:40.202 --> 00:03:42.706
What will make this machine you?

00:03:44.001 --> 00:03:45.672
It'll find it on its own.

00:03:45.672 --> 00:03:48.417
If we can't figure out its point of reaction,

00:03:50.772 --> 00:03:51.917
it's a fail.

00:03:53.842 --> 00:03:55.157
Good luck with it.

00:04:05.492 --> 00:04:09.106
(A Piece of Your Mind)

00:04:11.902 --> 00:04:13.477
(Episode 1)

00:06:06.281 --> 00:06:07.457
What is it?

00:06:07.952 --> 00:06:09.486
I followed the music.

00:06:11.781 --> 00:06:14.967
The money-grubbing landlord is getting rid of the studio itself.

00:06:26.702 --> 00:06:28.907
Let's start again from here.

00:06:36.111 --> 00:06:37.246
Good day.

00:06:39.012 --> 00:06:41.486
Keep the door open so more people can hear it.

00:06:42.082 --> 00:06:44.157
This is the last song we recorded here.

00:07:16.611 --> 00:07:17.787
Goodbye.

00:07:33.531 --> 00:07:34.847
It's raining.

00:07:44.642 --> 00:07:46.657
I want to stay a little longer.

00:08:40.731 --> 00:08:43.107
(For sale or rent)

00:08:44.842 --> 00:08:46.617
The thunder is so loud.

00:09:28.952 --> 00:09:30.157
Four o'clock in the afternoon.

00:09:30.712 --> 00:09:32.257
It's daytime, but it's dark.

00:09:33.422 --> 00:09:34.657
Norway.

00:09:35.452 --> 00:09:36.627
Oslo.

00:09:37.592 --> 00:09:38.897
The forest on the way home from school.

00:09:39.391 --> 00:09:40.936
Dark afternoons.

00:09:41.692 --> 00:09:42.907
Do you remember?

00:09:53.842 --> 00:09:55.417
Ji Soo used to get scared.

00:10:08.822 --> 00:10:11.796
By the time we walked through the forest on our way from school,

00:10:12.462 --> 00:10:13.836
it was 3:20pm.

00:10:15.332 --> 00:10:16.867
It became dark in an instant.

00:10:46.922 --> 00:10:48.836
Ji Soo named it...

00:10:53.562 --> 00:10:56.346
- Nightlike afternoon. - Nightlike afternoon.

00:11:23.692 --> 00:11:26.432
(A dinnerware collection)

00:11:26.432 --> 00:11:30.247
(If interested in the items, please call the number below)

00:11:45.743 --> 00:11:46.888
So what was the point of reaction?

00:11:47.343 --> 00:11:48.658
- Lightning. - Light...

00:11:49.912 --> 00:11:51.217
Lightning? That's so random.

00:11:51.813 --> 00:11:53.127
He did it his way.

00:11:55.583 --> 00:11:56.827
But it's...

00:11:58.723 --> 00:12:00.928
- How should I put it? - Hoon.

00:12:01.723 --> 00:12:03.038
It's what?

00:12:07.292 --> 00:12:11.308
Since it's advanced, let me ask something I'm really curious about.

00:12:15.103 --> 00:12:16.778
Do you still love Kim Ji Soo?

00:12:20.272 --> 00:12:23.613
AH Lab combines and derives patterns from...

00:12:23.613 --> 00:12:25.912
math, medicine, science, and humanities.

00:12:25.912 --> 00:12:28.698
It has developed a distinctive linearized network system.

00:12:30.152 --> 00:12:31.528
Time has passed,

00:12:32.152 --> 00:12:34.367
and the way of longing for her has changed a little.

00:12:36.262 --> 00:12:38.097
Except that it feels a bit hollow,

00:12:38.932 --> 00:12:40.207
everything is still the same.

00:13:01.882 --> 00:13:03.083
Mr. Park.

00:13:03.083 --> 00:13:04.623
These trees are so nice.

00:13:04.623 --> 00:13:06.568
They're getting nicer and nicer.

00:13:07.493 --> 00:13:09.422
Oh my goodness!

00:13:09.422 --> 00:13:10.422
Are you okay?

00:13:10.422 --> 00:13:11.892
I'm okay.

00:13:11.892 --> 00:13:15.577
Oh, dear. You guys must not be okay.

00:13:16.432 --> 00:13:19.833
My goodness. I'm sure I'm not in my right mind.

00:13:19.833 --> 00:13:21.672
What in the world did I trip on?

00:13:21.672 --> 00:13:24.172
Get up, guys.

00:13:24.172 --> 00:13:26.948
Goodness, I'm hopeless.

00:13:27.172 --> 00:13:29.888
This is so exhausting.

00:13:57.343 --> 00:13:59.347
Hi, Uncle.

00:13:59.912 --> 00:14:01.048
What?

00:14:02.483 --> 00:14:04.117
When did you come?

00:14:51.262 --> 00:14:53.607
When did Grandma leave Oslo?

00:14:54.162 --> 00:14:56.808
She was there from 1997 to 2005.

00:14:58.262 --> 00:14:59.648
Gosh.

00:15:00.873 --> 00:15:02.548
Goodness.

00:15:04.302 --> 00:15:06.542
Grandma says she's in Africa all the time.

00:15:06.542 --> 00:15:08.048
I have tons of work to do.

00:15:08.713 --> 00:15:10.983
The UV rays are no joke at the farm.

00:15:10.983 --> 00:15:13.827
They penetrate just about anything. All the melanin...

00:15:13.912 --> 00:15:16.252
Gosh, my skin used to be the source of my beauty.

00:15:16.252 --> 00:15:17.898
Don't sit on the threshold.

00:15:18.652 --> 00:15:20.768
As if I have any luck left to lose.

00:15:24.792 --> 00:15:26.867
How many years has Soon Ho been working at the farm?

00:15:26.892 --> 00:15:28.438
- 8 years. - 9 years.

00:15:29.262 --> 00:15:32.048
That thing reduced it by a year. It's nine years.

00:15:38.642 --> 00:15:41.842
Uncle, is there any chance I could go to Seoul?

00:15:41.843 --> 00:15:43.012
I want to leave this place.

00:15:43.012 --> 00:15:44.617
You said you didn't want to leave the farm.

00:15:44.813 --> 00:15:46.188
That's all in the past.

00:15:50.282 --> 00:15:52.227
There might be a job for you.

00:15:53.552 --> 00:15:55.568
What? Where?

00:15:55.792 --> 00:15:57.597
What do you mean you bought a recording studio?

00:15:57.963 --> 00:15:59.993
It's the best place to collect voices.

00:15:59.993 --> 00:16:01.938
I want to run tests there on one more person.

00:16:01.963 --> 00:16:05.037
Right, you shouldn't share yours. Don't open what's in your head.

00:16:05.533 --> 00:16:07.378
I won't share this one either.

00:16:08.373 --> 00:16:09.618
Who is it?

00:16:29.992 --> 00:16:32.162
You want me to meet Kim Ji Soo?

00:16:32.162 --> 00:16:33.567
Okay.

00:16:34.093 --> 00:16:37.603
I'll slap her in the face as soon as I meet her.

00:16:37.603 --> 00:16:40.172
Then I'll ask her how it feels to have missed out...

00:16:40.172 --> 00:16:43.343
on the Mark Zuckerberg of Korea and capture the look on her face.

00:16:43.343 --> 00:16:46.618
Soon Ho, that isn't a suitable comparison.

00:16:46.843 --> 00:16:48.113
And I feel like you might actually slap her.

00:16:48.113 --> 00:16:50.618
This is something I've got to do.

00:16:51.543 --> 00:16:52.828
What do I get in return?

00:16:53.482 --> 00:16:56.598
There's someone who suits Ji Soo.

00:17:08.803 --> 00:17:09.878
(For sale or rent)

00:17:22.283 --> 00:17:23.688
Can you step aside?

00:17:26.853 --> 00:17:29.328
- Here. - It's okay.

00:17:32.023 --> 00:17:34.252
Which floor are you visiting?

00:17:34.253 --> 00:17:35.662
The second floor.

00:17:35.662 --> 00:17:38.063
I left a cactus here because it was here before we moved in,

00:17:38.063 --> 00:17:40.263
but they'll probably throw it out when they clear out the studio,

00:17:40.263 --> 00:17:41.432
so I came to get it.

00:17:41.432 --> 00:17:43.477
I see. You worked at the studio.

00:17:44.003 --> 00:17:45.573
Where do you want me to put this?

00:17:45.573 --> 00:17:47.007
Oh, right there.

00:17:47.803 --> 00:17:49.348
What did you do at the studio?

00:17:49.573 --> 00:17:51.378
I was a sound engineer.

00:17:55.172 --> 00:17:58.118
There's someone who suits Ji Soo.

00:18:00.382 --> 00:18:02.982
I love this smell of vacancy.

00:18:02.982 --> 00:18:05.083
There aren't many recording studios just for classical music.

00:18:05.083 --> 00:18:06.992
I don't get why they're closing it down.

00:18:06.992 --> 00:18:09.838
Just for classical music? Why?

00:18:10.093 --> 00:18:12.232
But who said it was to be closed down?

00:18:12.232 --> 00:18:13.707
It can't be.

00:18:13.892 --> 00:18:15.438
We're not closing it down.

00:18:15.462 --> 00:18:18.237
I'm the new manager here.

00:18:19.273 --> 00:18:20.878
No way.

00:18:20.902 --> 00:18:22.007
What?

00:18:23.003 --> 00:18:25.817
I thought it was the end, but it's not.

00:18:26.373 --> 00:18:29.741
Right? Can I keep working here?

00:18:29.742 --> 00:18:30.982
What did you major in college?

00:18:30.982 --> 00:18:32.283
- Data processing. - Gosh.

00:18:32.283 --> 00:18:33.957
But how did you end up working in this field?

00:18:34.283 --> 00:18:37.083
I studied music too, and the engineering field...

00:18:37.083 --> 00:18:38.398
- basically... - What about your age?

00:18:39.392 --> 00:18:40.767
I'm 29.

00:18:40.853 --> 00:18:44.162
This is not good. 29-year-olds are the biggest problem.

00:18:44.162 --> 00:18:46.892
They think they have it the worst in this world.

00:18:46.892 --> 00:18:49.462
They're worse than people who are 39 and 49.

00:18:49.462 --> 00:18:52.631
They complain the most, saying they're so old.

00:18:52.632 --> 00:18:55.878
They think their life is almost over once they turn 30.

00:18:56.543 --> 00:18:58.873
Can I keep working at the studio?

00:18:58.873 --> 00:19:00.247
We'll get to that later.

00:19:01.212 --> 00:19:04.557
Gosh, my back.

00:19:08.652 --> 00:19:10.328
Would you buy some dishes for me?

00:19:13.492 --> 00:19:14.492
(Eunjoo Homestay)

00:19:14.492 --> 00:19:16.168
What's with the dishes?

00:19:16.462 --> 00:19:19.162
She could just buy them herself. Why make someone else do it?

00:19:19.162 --> 00:19:20.461
It feels weird.

00:19:20.462 --> 00:19:21.833
Thank you.

00:19:21.833 --> 00:19:23.263
It's not a big deal.

00:19:23.263 --> 00:19:24.378
What about work?

00:19:25.162 --> 00:19:26.578
Are you staying?

00:19:26.803 --> 00:19:28.372
Thank you for the food.

00:19:28.373 --> 00:19:30.618
She didn't tell me to stop coming.

00:19:32.573 --> 00:19:34.448
- Gosh. - Here.

00:19:40.083 --> 00:19:41.388
Hello?

00:19:41.982 --> 00:19:43.057
Yes.

00:19:44.783 --> 00:19:45.868
Pardon?

00:19:47.553 --> 00:19:49.067
I'll be right out.

00:19:49.962 --> 00:19:51.263
I need to step out for a minute.

00:19:51.263 --> 00:19:52.338
What is it?

00:19:52.432 --> 00:19:54.992
This is unusual. The seller is coming here herself.

00:19:54.992 --> 00:19:56.662
- Who is it? - Kim Ji Soo.

00:19:56.662 --> 00:19:58.178
- Do you know her? - No.

00:20:06.242 --> 00:20:07.343
What's the soup today?

00:20:07.343 --> 00:20:08.957
Bean sprout soup.

00:20:09.182 --> 00:20:10.858
With tofu?

00:20:10.882 --> 00:20:12.388
Whatever.

00:20:13.452 --> 00:20:15.598
- What? - Goodness.

00:20:35.232 --> 00:20:37.317
It was nothing.

00:20:38.073 --> 00:20:42.817
It was just the sight of a stranger climbing up the hill.

00:20:45.712 --> 00:20:47.158
But strangely,

00:20:48.182 --> 00:20:51.027
she burrowed into my heart.

00:21:11.003 --> 00:21:12.648
Ms. Kim Ji Soo?

00:21:15.543 --> 00:21:17.388
I was so grateful...

00:21:18.283 --> 00:21:20.487
and I didn't want them to break.

00:21:48.773 --> 00:21:50.257
Here are the dishes.

00:22:00.793 --> 00:22:01.997
You can keep them.

00:22:04.222 --> 00:22:05.692
- Why? - That's life.

00:22:05.692 --> 00:22:08.668
Things happen that you just can't explain.

00:22:11.763 --> 00:22:13.702
But she exists.

00:22:13.702 --> 00:22:15.472
Kim Ji Soo really does exist.

00:22:15.472 --> 00:22:16.948
Do you know her?

00:22:18.373 --> 00:22:19.972
In my imagination.

00:22:19.972 --> 00:22:23.817
I only imagined her for nine years.

00:22:23.843 --> 00:22:25.057
Why?

00:22:25.182 --> 00:22:27.482
Because I heard about her for nine years.

00:22:27.482 --> 00:22:28.482
And?

00:22:28.482 --> 00:22:29.623
That's all.

00:22:29.623 --> 00:22:32.668
Anyway, I don't care about that dinnerware.

00:22:35.892 --> 00:22:40.063
You don't even care about them, but Ms. Kim packed them with care.

00:22:40.063 --> 00:22:43.063
She took a bus and climbed up a hill with that heavy box.

00:22:43.063 --> 00:22:46.432
She thanked me with all her heart at least 100 times before she left.

00:22:46.432 --> 00:22:48.307
Don't treat the dishes like that.

00:22:49.043 --> 00:22:50.148
This.

00:22:51.303 --> 00:22:52.343
What is it?

00:22:52.343 --> 00:22:55.118
He said you'd know. A recording schedule?

00:22:56.043 --> 00:22:57.712
I don't know these performers.

00:22:57.712 --> 00:23:00.057
What? Will you not record them if you don't know them?

00:23:00.452 --> 00:23:01.712
- I should. - You have a lot of work to do.

00:23:01.712 --> 00:23:02.797
I do.

00:23:03.952 --> 00:23:05.198
I'll work hard.

00:23:23.003 --> 00:23:25.118
Hi there.

00:23:31.613 --> 00:23:34.757
Hi there. You too. Hi.

00:23:39.523 --> 00:23:40.598
Hi.

00:23:43.793 --> 00:23:46.608
- Hello. - Who would've known?

00:23:46.692 --> 00:23:49.007
I didn't think we'd get to record here again.

00:23:49.763 --> 00:23:51.138
Right?

00:24:02.882 --> 00:24:04.888
- Lower the cello balance. - Okay.

00:24:54.063 --> 00:24:56.277
What happened here?

00:25:02.642 --> 00:25:03.948
Oh my gosh. What happened here?

00:25:28.992 --> 00:25:31.908
Again?

00:25:41.442 --> 00:25:42.817
Dear Before Dawn.

00:25:43.313 --> 00:25:45.742
Please clean before you leave.

00:25:45.742 --> 00:25:47.088
(Dear Before Dawn. Please clean before you leave.)

00:26:14.873 --> 00:26:17.442
Nightlike afternoon.

00:26:17.442 --> 00:26:20.088
(Nightlike afternoon)

00:26:28.152 --> 00:26:29.467
You're incredible.

00:26:30.662 --> 00:26:31.767
Seriously.

00:26:47.972 --> 00:26:50.858
Excuse me. Who are you? What are you doing in there?

00:26:51.583 --> 00:26:52.828
Did the sun rise already?

00:27:06.863 --> 00:27:08.267
What's his deal?

00:27:13.432 --> 00:27:14.948
Look at the spacing.

00:27:15.603 --> 00:27:17.378
He must be Before Dawn.

00:27:28.382 --> 00:27:30.557
- What is this? - Excuse me.

00:27:32.793 --> 00:27:33.967
That's right.

00:27:35.922 --> 00:27:37.767
I always mean to clean up but forget.

00:27:38.162 --> 00:27:39.368
I'll do it.

00:27:40.192 --> 00:27:42.108
Don't you rent it only until before dawn?

00:27:42.662 --> 00:27:44.207
Until 4am.

00:27:44.603 --> 00:27:45.908
Do you know what time it is?

00:27:47.232 --> 00:27:48.678
I'm so busy.

00:27:49.902 --> 00:27:51.672
I'm here at 8:30 on the dot,

00:27:51.672 --> 00:27:54.273
so please clean up before then. Okay?

00:27:54.273 --> 00:27:55.517
8:30.

00:28:12.462 --> 00:28:14.868
Keep the door open so more people can hear it.

00:28:48.563 --> 00:28:49.678
Seo Woo!

00:28:53.073 --> 00:28:54.247
You found it.

00:28:55.232 --> 00:28:56.848
Because of the recital.

00:28:57.503 --> 00:28:58.977
- Let me. - It's okay.

00:29:01.773 --> 00:29:04.388
My grandmother groomed these trees for over 30 years.

00:29:04.882 --> 00:29:08.013
She did them all herself? That's amazing.

00:29:08.013 --> 00:29:11.098
She's devoted to anything that is alive.

00:29:12.023 --> 00:29:13.628
How many people are coming?

00:29:13.952 --> 00:29:15.192
The living room always fills up.

00:29:15.192 --> 00:29:16.898
Sometimes, some people have to sit in the yard.

00:29:17.563 --> 00:29:19.767
That's bigger than I expected.

00:29:21.363 --> 00:29:23.237
It's like a family function.

00:29:23.902 --> 00:29:25.908
When my grandmother was a diplomat,

00:29:26.232 --> 00:29:29.073
she used to sponsor Korean kids who were musically talented...

00:29:29.073 --> 00:29:31.777
and hold recitals for them. She must have liked it.

00:29:33.513 --> 00:29:35.817
Your grandmother did a lot of good things.

00:29:36.513 --> 00:29:37.588
That's right.

00:29:37.813 --> 00:29:41.257
If she had saved all that money, I'd own a building now.

00:29:43.283 --> 00:29:46.527
She insists they're all siblings and family,

00:29:46.692 --> 00:29:47.997
but it's not the same.

00:29:48.692 --> 00:29:50.892
I consider only one uncle my family,

00:29:50.892 --> 00:29:52.938
and the rest are strangers to me.

00:29:53.263 --> 00:29:55.237
Why only him?

00:29:55.863 --> 00:29:58.178
Because he's good looking and successful.

00:30:01.503 --> 00:30:03.878
I can't believe you fell for that. I'm kidding.

00:30:04.142 --> 00:30:07.418
I have a special history with my uncle.

00:30:10.843 --> 00:30:13.588
I've never met someone who sponsors people in person.

00:30:13.912 --> 00:30:15.388
She's so amazing.

00:30:15.452 --> 00:30:18.997
What do you think? Do you trust me more now?

00:30:20.452 --> 00:30:21.967
So I was thinking...

00:30:25.392 --> 00:30:27.668
Record Kim Ji Soo saying a few things.

00:30:28.063 --> 00:30:30.807
- But why? - How would I know?

00:30:31.063 --> 00:30:33.108
I don't even know what this does.

00:30:34.573 --> 00:30:35.833
If you record someone with this,

00:30:35.833 --> 00:30:37.972
it'll sound like the person is right next to you.

00:30:37.972 --> 00:30:39.141
That's right.

00:30:39.142 --> 00:30:42.287
The person must want to hear her voice like she was there.

00:30:42.412 --> 00:30:43.813
Who? Why?

00:30:43.813 --> 00:30:45.583
I need to know that before I do it.

00:30:45.583 --> 00:30:47.987
Well... Someone...

00:30:49.053 --> 00:30:51.098
- misses Kim Ji Soo. - Who?

00:30:51.823 --> 00:30:53.328
Let's stop there.

00:30:55.222 --> 00:30:57.892
I'm not close enough with her to record her voice.

00:30:57.892 --> 00:30:59.368
Do you have to be?

00:30:59.932 --> 00:31:02.833
You can buy some more dishes. Buy them in person.

00:31:02.833 --> 00:31:05.202
And chat a little bit, and go,

00:31:05.202 --> 00:31:08.608
"Oh my. You have a great voice." And record it.

00:31:08.773 --> 00:31:11.378
Do you record people's voices if they're nice?

00:31:11.742 --> 00:31:13.873
It's not like I'm getting digits.

00:31:13.873 --> 00:31:16.658
"I like you. May I get your voice?" Should I say that?

00:31:18.343 --> 00:31:19.688
Just do it.

00:32:51.742 --> 00:32:53.573
A turntable?

00:32:53.573 --> 00:32:55.588
That's super old.

00:32:56.712 --> 00:32:58.287
I wonder if it works.

00:33:22.233 --> 00:33:25.248
What is your relationship with Kim Ji Soo?

00:33:25.443 --> 00:33:27.047
We're kids who are like islands.

00:33:29.313 --> 00:33:30.511
Who?

00:33:30.512 --> 00:33:33.158
You asked about Kim Ji Soo and me.

00:33:37.153 --> 00:33:39.297
How long have you known each other?

00:34:09.983 --> 00:34:13.552
The only two Korean kids in Norway...

00:34:13.552 --> 00:34:14.868
meet when they're young.

00:34:15.123 --> 00:34:16.868
They go to middle school,

00:34:17.592 --> 00:34:19.167
then they go to high school.

00:35:21.253 --> 00:35:23.198
They meet as soon as the sun rises,

00:35:23.222 --> 00:35:25.038
and part once the sun sets.

00:35:26.592 --> 00:35:29.737
They spend 24 hours together on polar days.

00:35:33.032 --> 00:35:34.978
They dreaded the sun setting more than anything.

00:35:39.043 --> 00:35:41.288
- Ga. - Gya.

00:35:41.472 --> 00:35:43.942
- Geo. - Gyeo.

00:35:43.943 --> 00:35:46.142
- Go. - Gyo.

00:35:46.142 --> 00:35:48.257
- Goo. - Gyoo.

00:35:50.423 --> 00:35:52.228
A single leaf

00:35:52.722 --> 00:35:54.768
Lands on the shoulder

00:35:54.853 --> 00:35:58.138
Without making a sound

00:35:58.492 --> 00:36:01.967
Cosmos laid its hand on me

00:36:02.333 --> 00:36:04.308
It was very light

00:36:05.603 --> 00:36:09.078
The language only they shared became their secret...

00:36:09.873 --> 00:36:11.518
and unified the kids who were like islands.

00:36:20.213 --> 00:36:21.611
Who are you?

00:36:21.612 --> 00:36:23.428
Introduce yourself first.

00:36:23.483 --> 00:36:25.428
Then I'll explain the relationship.

00:36:30.563 --> 00:36:32.138
Why are you hiding...

00:36:33.293 --> 00:36:35.932
What's with the voice? Why do you need it?

00:36:35.932 --> 00:36:38.808
Do you not plan to meet Ji Soo?

00:36:44.673 --> 00:36:45.673
How did it go?

00:36:45.673 --> 00:36:46.972
I'm not sure.

00:36:46.972 --> 00:36:49.888
It looks like she'll do it, but at the same time, not.

00:36:50.142 --> 00:36:52.713
Why did you make me do something like this?

00:36:52.713 --> 00:36:54.788
Why do you need her stupid voice?

00:36:57.052 --> 00:36:58.797
A video is enough.

00:36:59.523 --> 00:37:00.892
I only want...

00:37:00.892 --> 00:37:02.428
I only want...

00:37:02.653 --> 00:37:04.467
a small piece of her.

00:37:05.923 --> 00:37:09.268
Where are you right now?

00:37:12.103 --> 00:37:13.377
Look for me.

00:37:55.043 --> 00:37:58.587
I only want a small piece of her.

00:38:16.532 --> 00:38:17.837
Hello.

00:38:18.403 --> 00:38:19.478
Hello.

00:38:20.633 --> 00:38:22.147
Are you done?

00:38:22.532 --> 00:38:25.917
No. I can't see very well. The light won't turn on.

00:38:35.612 --> 00:38:37.452
It usually works if you hit it a few times.

00:38:37.452 --> 00:38:39.828
I'll tell the manager later when she comes.

00:38:56.333 --> 00:38:57.448
Darn it.

00:39:07.353 --> 00:39:08.428
Goodness.

00:39:09.583 --> 00:39:11.397
I can't see at all in the dark.

00:39:11.853 --> 00:39:14.627
I can't find my way in the movie theater either.

00:39:14.853 --> 00:39:16.737
- Can you see? - Yes.

00:39:17.322 --> 00:39:18.797
I'm used to the dark.

00:39:23.932 --> 00:39:26.848
- This way. - I can see that.

00:39:29.472 --> 00:39:30.717
Look for me.

00:39:37.043 --> 00:39:38.487
Excuse me.

00:39:38.943 --> 00:39:41.213
What time did you come today?

00:39:41.213 --> 00:39:43.228
I came early because I heard it was empty.

00:39:43.353 --> 00:39:44.828
Around 7pm?

00:39:44.853 --> 00:39:47.967
So you were here all night.

00:39:48.123 --> 00:39:49.368
That's right.

00:39:51.523 --> 00:39:54.038
I thought I heard a similar voice.

00:39:55.133 --> 00:39:57.638
He was hiding, so I couldn't see his face.

00:39:59.532 --> 00:40:00.773
- He was hiding? - Yes.

00:40:00.773 --> 00:40:02.673
At the manager's farm.

00:40:02.673 --> 00:40:04.702
She asked me to record something.

00:40:04.702 --> 00:40:07.687
It was in some room with an old turntable.

00:40:07.742 --> 00:40:11.142
There was nowhere for a person to hide, but he was hiding.

00:40:11.142 --> 00:40:13.458
When did Grandma leave Oslo?

00:40:13.512 --> 00:40:16.127
She was there from 1997 to 2005.

00:40:16.952 --> 00:40:18.658
What did he say?

00:40:19.153 --> 00:40:21.698
To look for him. He said to look for him.

00:40:22.623 --> 00:40:24.463
What did you say that he said to look for him?

00:40:24.463 --> 00:40:26.862
I asked him where he was, and he said to look for him.

00:40:26.862 --> 00:40:28.333
Why did you ask where he was?

00:40:28.333 --> 00:40:31.308
Because he was hiding while talking to me, that's why.

00:40:33.833 --> 00:40:34.833
That's odd.

00:40:34.833 --> 00:40:36.777
It's very odd.

00:40:37.142 --> 00:40:39.342
My life is filled with odd things these days.

00:40:39.342 --> 00:40:41.873
People I didn't know suddenly appear...

00:40:41.873 --> 00:40:43.817
and make odd requests.

00:40:47.483 --> 00:40:49.158
I'm sorry. You were working.

00:40:49.713 --> 00:40:51.698
Time is money here.

00:40:52.853 --> 00:40:54.127
Work hard.

00:41:00.193 --> 00:41:02.437
Excuse me. Do you...

00:41:04.702 --> 00:41:07.301
understand wanting a recording of someone's voice...

00:41:07.302 --> 00:41:08.448
because you miss them?

00:41:10.342 --> 00:41:12.417
It's not very conventional,

00:41:12.443 --> 00:41:14.448
but I understand.

00:41:16.943 --> 00:41:19.742
Whether you cherish a photograph or a voice recording,

00:41:19.742 --> 00:41:21.558
I think it's the same.

00:41:27.353 --> 00:41:28.768
Goodnight.

00:41:42.103 --> 00:41:44.547
- I think it's okay. - Don't do it.

00:41:44.673 --> 00:41:45.948
She's weird.

00:41:46.742 --> 00:41:49.618
Why would a woman sell dinnerware?

00:41:49.873 --> 00:41:51.742
- Record it. - No.

00:41:51.742 --> 00:41:53.313
It's all a ploy.

00:41:53.313 --> 00:41:55.558
Seo Woo is the idiot for getting caught in the middle.

00:41:56.653 --> 00:41:58.158
Tell her who you really are.

00:41:58.253 --> 00:42:01.052
Who is that? A classmate in our department...

00:42:01.052 --> 00:42:02.123
You brat!

00:42:02.123 --> 00:42:03.693
I said to put the dishes in the sink.

00:42:03.693 --> 00:42:06.698
I finished doing the dishes already. Darn it.

00:42:08.392 --> 00:42:11.138
Do I record the voice or not?

00:42:14.972 --> 00:42:18.817
A piece, a piece

00:42:18.943 --> 00:42:20.888
A piece, a piece

00:42:29.653 --> 00:42:32.958
Open the window when the sunlight hits, okay?

00:42:33.153 --> 00:42:35.328
Don't leave the curtain down.

00:42:35.822 --> 00:42:37.638
It rained all day there too, right?

00:42:37.923 --> 00:42:40.092
The mill down the hill got flooded.

00:42:40.092 --> 00:42:43.208
The boiler room and the field are a real mess.

00:42:43.603 --> 00:42:47.047
We're fine only because we're high up.

00:42:48.032 --> 00:42:51.543
Seo Woo. A bunch of young kids came today,

00:42:51.543 --> 00:42:55.518
taking pictures and traveling. It looked nice.

00:42:56.472 --> 00:42:58.087
You should date too.

00:42:58.383 --> 00:43:00.158
You should date while you're young.

00:43:01.782 --> 00:43:03.998
I said okay.

00:43:10.322 --> 00:43:13.397
Open the window when the sunlight hits, okay?

00:43:13.793 --> 00:43:15.768
Don't leave the curtain down.

00:43:16.532 --> 00:43:18.078
It rained all day there too, right?

00:43:18.733 --> 00:43:20.748
The mill down the hill got flooded.

00:43:20.873 --> 00:43:23.777
The boiler room and the field are a real mess.

00:43:24.302 --> 00:43:26.848
We're fine only because we're high up.

00:43:28.213 --> 00:43:31.583
Seo Woo. A bunch of young kids came today,

00:43:31.583 --> 00:43:35.527
taking pictures and traveling. It looked nice.

00:43:38.623 --> 00:43:41.868
I programmed it so that no one but you and I can talk to it.

00:43:42.623 --> 00:43:44.937
It was either a simple error or you did it wrong.

00:43:45.862 --> 00:43:48.563
Why are you so careless?

00:43:48.563 --> 00:43:49.808
You're just asking for it.

00:43:50.862 --> 00:43:52.202
I told you,

00:43:52.202 --> 00:43:54.908
we can't use it for therapy if you can't properly limit access.

00:43:58.242 --> 00:44:00.587
I reprogrammed it. It should be okay now.

00:44:01.512 --> 00:44:04.518
Use it. Try to get through if you can.

00:44:04.782 --> 00:44:07.027
Are you saying I can get through or not?

00:44:07.713 --> 00:44:08.857
Darn it.

00:44:37.313 --> 00:44:38.742
- Oh, my. - Send me the address...

00:44:38.742 --> 00:44:40.313
where I should receive the package. I'll do it.

00:44:40.313 --> 00:44:42.187
Why are you making it complicated?

00:44:42.552 --> 00:44:44.098
You should just receive it where you normally do.

00:44:56.432 --> 00:44:58.737
Hey. Send me an address in Seoul.

00:44:58.833 --> 00:45:00.732
Seo Woo says she'll do it.

00:45:00.733 --> 00:45:01.908
(77-30 Wokin 4-gil)

00:45:14.782 --> 00:45:16.187
What are you looking at?

00:45:16.983 --> 00:45:18.328
The green.

00:45:19.423 --> 00:45:21.567
Looking at something green soothes me.

00:45:23.322 --> 00:45:25.262
I'll block your view if I sit here.

00:45:25.262 --> 00:45:27.567
- Should I sit to the side? - It's okay.

00:45:31.003 --> 00:45:32.262
Do you work nearby?

00:45:32.262 --> 00:45:34.277
Yes, a few stop away.

00:45:35.273 --> 00:45:37.302
I asked to meet to buy some more pieces.

00:45:37.302 --> 00:45:38.678
Do you like the dishes?

00:45:39.242 --> 00:45:41.248
It looks great with traditional Korean food too.

00:45:45.612 --> 00:45:47.153
Should I send it to the same address?

00:45:47.153 --> 00:45:51.098
No, no. Not there. Don't bring it yourself this time. It's heavy.

00:45:51.883 --> 00:45:53.757
What's the address again?

00:45:54.092 --> 00:45:56.627
What was it? It's for a friend.

00:45:57.423 --> 00:45:58.768
I'll jot it down.

00:46:04.432 --> 00:46:05.507
(Prescription)

00:46:14.543 --> 00:46:17.217
(Prescription, Name: Kim Ji Soo)

00:46:19.483 --> 00:46:20.987
It's my prescription.

00:46:21.182 --> 00:46:23.288
I know. I know the medicine too.

00:46:24.952 --> 00:46:27.952
I went to see a psychiatrist before too. Just once.

00:46:27.952 --> 00:46:30.837
It's as common as the common cold these days.

00:46:36.662 --> 00:46:38.038
Where should I write it?

00:46:39.932 --> 00:46:41.808
I'll text it to you.

00:46:43.673 --> 00:46:47.147
That's right. That's so simple. What's wrong with me?

00:46:49.572 --> 00:46:53.587
When I feel frustrated, I go to the highest point in town.

00:46:56.313 --> 00:46:58.023
It's therapeutic to look down.

00:46:58.023 --> 00:47:01.123
They say when astronauts look down on Earth from space,

00:47:01.123 --> 00:47:02.892
they get a whole new outlook on life.

00:47:02.892 --> 00:47:04.538
All their worries seem trivial.

00:47:11.362 --> 00:47:13.038
That's why I sell my dinnerware.

00:47:14.032 --> 00:47:15.308
After my session,

00:47:15.833 --> 00:47:17.547
I felt like I should do something.

00:47:17.603 --> 00:47:20.047
So I posted pictures of my dinnerware that I cherish.

00:47:20.403 --> 00:47:21.773
When I delivered it to you,

00:47:21.773 --> 00:47:23.848
it was the first time I left home in three months.

00:47:27.282 --> 00:47:28.357
Excuse me.

00:47:36.523 --> 00:47:37.592
What?

00:47:37.592 --> 00:47:40.467
You know, like a-e-i-o-u.

00:47:40.762 --> 00:47:43.903
Consonants, vowels, sentences.

00:47:43.903 --> 00:47:46.607
Which sentences? You're not making any sense.

00:47:46.702 --> 00:47:48.047
I'll email you.

00:47:48.202 --> 00:47:49.978
I wouldn't know even if I saw it.

00:47:50.572 --> 00:47:54.147
Check your email. That will explain everything.

00:47:54.213 --> 00:47:56.018
Refer to that when you record her voice.

00:47:58.943 --> 00:48:00.087
What was that?

00:49:32.702 --> 00:49:33.817
Let's go.

00:50:45.813 --> 00:50:48.328
Won, look at the ceiling.

00:50:50.653 --> 00:50:51.897
It's soothing.

00:50:57.662 --> 00:50:58.797
Come in.

00:51:05.733 --> 00:51:07.277
Stand in front of the mic.

00:51:08.333 --> 00:51:09.408
Me?

00:51:12.273 --> 00:51:14.047
Say anything you want.

00:51:15.912 --> 00:51:18.182
- And? - I'll record it.

00:51:18.182 --> 00:51:21.487
If there's someone who misses you, I'll sell it at a high price.

00:51:22.813 --> 00:51:24.428
There's no one like that.

00:51:26.423 --> 00:51:30.067
Don't you think everyone has at least one person who misses them?

00:51:33.123 --> 00:51:36.038
- I don't know. - Don't think too much about it.

00:51:36.532 --> 00:51:38.538
You don't have to do it if you don't want to.

00:51:43.302 --> 00:51:44.978
What should I do?

00:51:46.903 --> 00:51:50.857
First, let's begin with the basics. Ga, na, da, ra, and so on.

00:51:51.483 --> 00:51:53.417
You can start once I give you the signal.

00:52:01.253 --> 00:52:02.368
Ga.

00:52:06.392 --> 00:52:07.507
Gya.

00:52:08.092 --> 00:52:09.167
- Geo. - Geo.

00:52:09.892 --> 00:52:11.007
- Gyeo. - Gyeo.

00:52:12.162 --> 00:52:13.277
- Go. - Go.

00:52:14.133 --> 00:52:15.208
- Gyo. - Gyo.

00:52:16.403 --> 00:52:17.578
- Goo. - Goo.

00:52:18.072 --> 00:52:19.978
- Gyoo. - Gyoo.

00:52:22.273 --> 00:52:24.487
Isn't it ga, na, da, ra?

00:52:26.883 --> 00:52:29.127
Let's do something longer this time.

00:52:29.353 --> 00:52:31.357
I'll give you a sentence. Hold on.

00:52:34.722 --> 00:52:35.897
A single

00:52:36.753 --> 00:52:37.967
Leaf

00:52:39.963 --> 00:52:42.208
Lands on the shoulder

00:52:43.092 --> 00:52:45.478
Without making

00:52:47.262 --> 00:52:49.748
A sound

00:52:53.673 --> 00:52:55.618
Cosmos laid

00:52:56.273 --> 00:52:58.187
Its hand on me

00:53:01.012 --> 00:53:02.257
It was

00:53:04.182 --> 00:53:05.458
Very light

00:53:05.753 --> 00:53:07.158
It was

00:53:07.653 --> 00:53:09.228
Very light

00:53:23.532 --> 00:53:26.848
You know that sentence earlier? You had it memorized.

00:53:27.373 --> 00:53:31.518
I learned Korean in Norway using Korean poetry and novels.

00:53:34.813 --> 00:53:37.052
I'll ship over the bowl as soon as I get home.

00:53:37.052 --> 00:53:38.958
The address.

00:53:42.492 --> 00:53:44.837
It's near the cafe.

00:53:46.662 --> 00:53:49.808
I haven't been to her place yet.

00:53:50.793 --> 00:53:53.507
(Kim Ji Soo)

00:53:55.032 --> 00:53:56.408
I sent it.

00:54:00.043 --> 00:54:01.917
Okay. Goodbye.

00:54:07.782 --> 00:54:11.897
(Han Seo Woo, 47-341 Wokin-dong, Jongro-gu)

00:54:36.342 --> 00:54:37.817
It's Ha Won, isn't it?

00:54:39.642 --> 00:54:43.058
Did Ha Won put you up to this? All of it?

00:54:47.083 --> 00:54:48.329
It's Ha Won, isn't it?

00:54:50.254 --> 00:54:53.639
Did Ha Won put you up to this? All of it?

00:54:54.794 --> 00:54:56.263
I don't know who that is.

00:54:56.263 --> 00:54:57.809
That address you sent me...

00:54:58.103 --> 00:55:00.338
Only Ha Won and I know that address.

00:55:13.683 --> 00:55:15.214
I don't know.

00:55:15.214 --> 00:55:17.088
What about this address?

00:55:18.053 --> 00:55:19.524
Who lives here?

00:55:19.524 --> 00:55:21.223
My supervisor.

00:55:21.223 --> 00:55:23.594
What is your supervisor's name?

00:55:23.594 --> 00:55:25.399
Moon Soon Ho.

00:55:27.064 --> 00:55:28.568
Then it's not him.

00:55:29.464 --> 00:55:31.864
True. It would make no sense.

00:55:31.864 --> 00:55:33.979
I was just overly sensitive.

00:55:34.333 --> 00:55:36.048
He'd never do that.

00:55:36.574 --> 00:55:38.718
Are you all right?

00:56:08.074 --> 00:56:09.178
Seo Woo.

00:56:10.134 --> 00:56:11.303
Who was that just now?

00:56:11.303 --> 00:56:13.119
Oh, my heart.

00:56:13.674 --> 00:56:15.373
I can't handle this.

00:56:15.373 --> 00:56:17.988
I've used up all my lies for my entire life today.

00:56:18.214 --> 00:56:20.889
Hey. Who was that?

00:56:21.114 --> 00:56:22.588
Kim Ji Soo.

00:56:25.583 --> 00:56:28.253
What? Are you insane?

00:56:28.254 --> 00:56:29.694
Why did you bring her here?

00:56:29.694 --> 00:56:31.769
What about Ha Won?

00:56:32.393 --> 00:56:36.493
Ha Won just flat out told her, "It's me, Ha Won."

00:56:36.493 --> 00:56:40.278
When she saw the address, she asked, "Ha Won put you up to this, right?"

00:56:40.663 --> 00:56:42.373
She said it's an address only the two of them know.

00:56:42.373 --> 00:56:43.579
Oh, no.

00:56:43.774 --> 00:56:47.574
A sentence that she memorizes, and an address that she knows.

00:56:47.574 --> 00:56:51.048
He sent her all these messages saying, "Look for me."

00:56:52.683 --> 00:56:55.588
He should show his face right about now.

00:56:56.583 --> 00:56:58.028
Why isn't he coming?

00:56:59.254 --> 00:57:01.993
Why did you bring her here?

00:57:01.993 --> 00:57:03.992
Who's Ha Won?

00:57:03.993 --> 00:57:04.993
Why?

00:57:04.993 --> 00:57:06.393
He said to look for him.

00:57:06.393 --> 00:57:08.738
He did? To you?

00:57:09.763 --> 00:57:12.163
He has lost his mind.

00:57:12.163 --> 00:57:13.864
That's why you brought Ji Soo here.

00:57:13.864 --> 00:57:16.873
I just can't stand it.

00:57:16.873 --> 00:57:18.818
You idiot.

00:57:21.473 --> 00:57:23.174
I won't do anything for you anymore.

00:57:23.174 --> 00:57:25.459
Don't ask me to do anything anymore.

00:57:26.484 --> 00:57:29.928
A single leaf

00:57:32.183 --> 00:57:34.528
Lands on the shoulder

00:57:35.623 --> 00:57:36.694
Without

00:57:36.694 --> 00:57:39.039
I'm done once I send this.

00:57:39.993 --> 00:57:41.608
making a sound

00:57:42.564 --> 00:57:44.194
Cosmos

00:57:44.194 --> 00:57:45.364
Her tone got lower.

00:57:45.364 --> 00:57:47.064
- Laid its hand on me - Sorry?

00:57:47.064 --> 00:57:49.378
190Hz, no boom.

00:57:49.833 --> 00:57:51.778
About 55 decibels.

00:57:51.944 --> 00:57:53.218
It was

00:57:53.973 --> 00:57:55.588
Very light

00:57:55.774 --> 00:57:56.944
Her tone sounds depressed.

00:57:56.944 --> 00:57:58.289
You're right.

00:58:03.214 --> 00:58:06.028
Just answer me using common sense.

00:58:08.353 --> 00:58:12.399
This recording studio has something to do with a guy named Ha Won.

00:58:12.694 --> 00:58:14.964
From hiring me, down to every little detail.

00:58:14.964 --> 00:58:17.338
I don't know how long he has been planning it,

00:58:17.594 --> 00:58:20.079
but he does everything while hiding.

00:58:20.203 --> 00:58:22.079
He is very thorough.

00:58:22.734 --> 00:58:25.574
Everything points toward the girl, Kim Ji Soo.

00:58:25.574 --> 00:58:27.143
He misses her a lot.

00:58:27.143 --> 00:58:29.143
But she is depressed.

00:58:29.143 --> 00:58:30.519
That's why...

00:58:33.583 --> 00:58:36.059
What if I make the two of them...

00:58:36.754 --> 00:58:39.099
meet? What do you think?

00:58:41.623 --> 00:58:44.993
What am I doing? Am I just being a busybody?

00:58:44.993 --> 00:58:46.139
Right?

00:58:46.623 --> 00:58:48.838
I don't usually get involved in other people's matters.

00:58:48.993 --> 00:58:51.338
Why do you want to do that for them?

00:58:55.574 --> 00:58:58.349
You don't remember everyone's first impression, do you?

00:58:58.674 --> 00:58:59.818
Probably not.

00:59:00.873 --> 00:59:03.619
Me neither. I don't remember them all.

00:59:04.174 --> 00:59:07.519
But there are some people whom you first meet in passing,

00:59:07.683 --> 00:59:10.528
but you remember how that person opened the door and walked in,

00:59:10.783 --> 00:59:13.959
whether they were sitting or standing,

00:59:14.154 --> 00:59:16.528
or how you started talking to each other.

00:59:17.094 --> 00:59:20.568
Time can't erase the moment you first met them.

00:59:22.364 --> 00:59:25.979
How they walked up the hill.

00:59:29.033 --> 00:59:31.973
People like that tend to remain in my life for a long time.

00:59:31.973 --> 00:59:35.218
Ji Soo is like that. I want to help her.

00:59:47.223 --> 00:59:49.769
Do you always stare at people blatantly like that?

00:59:51.123 --> 00:59:52.499
Did I do that?

00:59:52.794 --> 00:59:54.593
Your reason was amusing.

00:59:54.594 --> 00:59:55.794
It's persuasive.

00:59:55.794 --> 00:59:57.068
Is it convincing?

00:59:58.404 --> 01:00:00.908
When you feel for someone...

01:00:02.734 --> 01:00:05.149
When you feel for them for no apparent reason,

01:00:05.774 --> 01:00:09.243
it's because of layers of afterimages gathered over time.

01:00:09.243 --> 01:00:12.258
I never thought about first impressions that you mention.

01:00:19.424 --> 01:00:21.599
I clearly remember when I first saw you.

01:00:29.333 --> 01:00:30.468
Me too.

01:00:30.763 --> 01:00:32.364
I saw you here.

01:00:32.364 --> 01:00:35.108
You were in there, and I was out here.

01:00:48.953 --> 01:00:50.984
See? You don't remember.

01:00:50.984 --> 01:00:52.959
I guess I'm just passing by.

01:00:55.953 --> 01:00:58.968
Should I have the two of them meet?

01:01:01.533 --> 01:01:04.269
What if meeting only makes them hurt more?

01:01:04.833 --> 01:01:06.608
Then that's their fate.

01:01:56.484 --> 01:01:59.599
Open the window when the sunlight hits, okay?

01:02:00.024 --> 01:02:01.968
Don't leave the curtain down.

01:02:02.694 --> 01:02:04.298
It rained all day there too, right?

01:02:04.864 --> 01:02:07.064
The mill down the hill got flooded.

01:02:07.064 --> 01:02:09.908
The boiler room and the field are a real mess.

01:02:16.933 --> 01:02:20.019
I don't talk to people who don't know music.

01:02:20.373 --> 01:02:22.519
Sir. That's not it.

01:02:22.674 --> 01:02:25.218
Yes. She's here. The musician.

01:02:25.384 --> 01:02:27.384
Since when was Seo Woo a musician?

01:02:27.384 --> 01:02:29.814
Hello. Let me explain.

01:02:29.814 --> 01:02:31.599
I don't care for your reasons.

01:02:32.024 --> 01:02:34.698
You could've just texted that the recording was canceled.

01:02:35.154 --> 01:02:36.269
Am I wrong?

01:02:39.663 --> 01:02:42.433
Our studio closed down, so we thought...

01:02:42.433 --> 01:02:44.694
everything previously scheduled had been canceled.

01:02:44.694 --> 01:02:45.803
I've heard enough.

01:02:45.803 --> 01:02:47.634
Something else got scheduled in between.

01:02:47.634 --> 01:02:50.178
I see. So he's doing that, but not this?

01:02:50.234 --> 01:02:52.718
I'll call Mr. Choi right away.

01:02:52.803 --> 01:02:55.419
Sir, please.

01:02:57.814 --> 01:02:59.059
Finish it in one take.

01:02:59.413 --> 01:03:01.314
You want me to do it?

01:03:01.314 --> 01:03:03.289
Talk to Jin Moo about the mixing.

01:03:03.553 --> 01:03:06.128
- Let's just call it a day... - I'll do it.

01:03:07.853 --> 01:03:10.353
I'll discuss the mixing with Mr. Choi,

01:03:10.353 --> 01:03:12.369
- and if he says it's bad... - Delete it.

01:03:12.964 --> 01:03:14.338
And we won't do a new take.

01:03:22.803 --> 01:03:24.349
It's so degrading.

01:03:26.074 --> 01:03:27.948
It's more degrading to come back.

01:04:42.413 --> 01:04:43.528
Hello.

01:04:57.064 --> 01:04:58.738
What are you doing?

01:05:01.203 --> 01:05:02.278
What?

01:05:04.174 --> 01:05:06.048
I'm on my way to see Kim Ji Soo.

01:05:06.803 --> 01:05:08.178
You said you wouldn't do anything.

01:05:08.444 --> 01:05:11.048
Tell Ha Won he has to come.

01:05:12.283 --> 01:05:14.519
Hey! Are you okay?

01:05:16.413 --> 01:05:17.588
What's with her?

01:05:18.183 --> 01:05:20.899
Chief. It's Hoon.

01:05:25.393 --> 01:05:27.594
- Hey. - Soon Ho said to call her.

01:05:27.594 --> 01:05:29.608
She knows you don't answer your phone during this time.

01:05:30.094 --> 01:05:32.238
It must be urgent if she called me.

01:05:58.464 --> 01:06:00.298
(Han Seo Woo)

01:06:09.433 --> 01:06:10.548
Hello.

01:06:11.404 --> 01:06:12.603
(Han Seo Woo)

01:06:12.603 --> 01:06:13.818
Are you with someone?

01:06:14.074 --> 01:06:15.718
I don't think she's here yet.

01:06:16.774 --> 01:06:18.618
Would you like to order first?

01:06:20.513 --> 01:06:21.618
Sure.

01:06:33.524 --> 01:06:34.639
Ji Soo.

01:06:35.393 --> 01:06:37.569
- Ji Soo? - Yes, Seo Woo.

01:06:39.904 --> 01:06:42.008
I'm running a little late.

01:06:43.173 --> 01:06:44.479
Where are you?

01:06:45.103 --> 01:06:46.779
I think I saw someone.

01:06:47.704 --> 01:06:49.418
I can't see him.

01:06:53.513 --> 01:06:55.628
Is it someone you really can't see?

01:06:58.053 --> 01:06:59.258
It's Ha Won, isn't it?

01:07:02.053 --> 01:07:04.069
- You can't see him? - No, never.

01:07:09.263 --> 01:07:10.409
Don't look back.

01:07:25.444 --> 01:07:26.559
Run.

01:07:51.704 --> 01:07:53.418
It was nothing.

01:07:56.013 --> 01:07:58.088
I haven't met him before,

01:08:00.984 --> 01:08:02.359
but he burrowed...

01:08:03.683 --> 01:08:04.859
into my heart.

01:08:46.024 --> 01:08:48.393
(A Piece of Your Mind)

01:08:48.393 --> 01:08:51.569
I shouldn't have done anything.

01:08:51.904 --> 01:08:54.633
Is there something you want to ask that guy Ha Won?

01:08:54.633 --> 01:08:56.409
I want to see him from afar.

01:08:57.503 --> 01:08:59.178
I won't run away next time.

01:08:59.603 --> 01:09:00.819
Next time? When?

01:09:01.404 --> 01:09:02.989
If I can apologize...

01:09:03.074 --> 01:09:04.519
I told you, it's nothing to apologize for.

01:09:04.673 --> 01:09:06.588
I told you over and over that it's too hard for me.

01:09:07.513 --> 01:09:10.559
How do you think they endured 10 years?

01:09:10.914 --> 01:09:13.159
Let's go tomorrow.
