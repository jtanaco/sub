(and incidents in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,780
- Hae Won. - Yes?

4
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:34,280
I have to bend over and pick that up.

5
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:36,050
- Go ahead. - Like this?

6
00:00:36,053 --> 00:00:37,780
Yes, bend over.

7
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:39,275
Okay.

8
00:00:45,829 --> 00:00:46,830
You're teasing me, aren't you?

9
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:48,390
No, I'm not.

10
00:00:48,398 --> 00:00:49,660
I just want to be close to you.

11
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:50,930
I'm not that slow-witted.

12
00:00:50,934 --> 00:00:52,695
Yes, you are.

13
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:54,030
- I am? - Yes.

14
00:00:54,037 --> 00:00:56,295
Jang Woo is the quick-witted one.

15
00:00:57,074 --> 00:00:58,565
You're right.

16
00:01:15,592 --> 00:01:18,455
Eun Seop!

17
00:01:20,263 --> 00:01:21,990
- Hi, Hwi. - Hi.

18
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:23,330
What was that?

19
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,500
- What's going on here? - What are you talking about?

20
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:30,040
Hyun Ji, I think I just saw something weird.

21
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,700
What did you see?

22
00:01:31,708 --> 00:01:35,010
Eun Seop and Hae Won...

23
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:37,135
No. What are you talking about?

24
00:01:38,315 --> 00:01:39,580
I think they ate something.

25
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:41,510
I smell something.

26
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,050
I don't know what you're talking about.

27
00:01:43,053 --> 00:01:45,880
Eun Seop, Hwi got kicked out of the bike shop today.

28
00:01:45,889 --> 00:01:47,890
Hey, don't tell him.

29
00:01:47,891 --> 00:01:49,390
You have no idea how stupid she is.

30
00:01:49,392 --> 00:01:52,215
She thought a 300-dollar saddle cost only 30 dollars.

31
00:01:52,429 --> 00:01:53,790
Please.

32
00:01:53,797 --> 00:01:55,160
What are we doing here anyway?

33
00:01:55,165 --> 00:01:57,330
I wanted to steal Eun Seop's wallet,

34
00:01:57,334 --> 00:01:59,160
but since he's here, I can't anymore.

35
00:01:59,169 --> 00:02:01,170
I see. Then let's go.

36
00:02:01,171 --> 00:02:04,095
All right. We should get something to eat too. I'm hungry.

37
00:02:12,315 --> 00:02:13,680
Let's pick up where we left off.

38
00:02:13,683 --> 00:02:15,175
What?

39
00:02:19,322 --> 00:02:24,685
(Episode 10: Let's Hold an Event)

40
00:02:30,934 --> 00:02:35,195
(Hyecheon Bus Terminal)

41
00:02:36,106 --> 00:02:37,795
Gosh.

42
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:39,370
- Hey! - Hi.

43
00:02:39,376 --> 00:02:41,410
- You just got here? - Yes.

44
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:44,110
- It's been slow lately. - I know.

45
00:02:44,114 --> 00:02:46,375
Excuse me.

46
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:50,650
Do you know where Mr. Lim Jong Pil lives, by any chance?

47
00:02:50,654 --> 00:02:52,445
Lim Jong Pil?

48
00:02:52,489 --> 00:02:54,315
Lim Jong Pil...

49
00:02:54,357 --> 00:02:55,890
Is he talking about Jong Pil?

50
00:02:55,892 --> 00:02:57,985
I guess.

51
00:02:58,061 --> 00:03:00,290
Why do you need to see him?

52
00:03:00,297 --> 00:03:01,985
What's the matter?

53
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:04,725
Well...

54
00:03:05,902 --> 00:03:08,370
We have all kinds of screws, sir.

55
00:03:08,371 --> 00:03:09,865
We sure do.

56
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:14,105
Hello... Darn it.

57
00:03:14,678 --> 00:03:18,205
- Hello. - Someone is looking for Jong Pil.

58
00:03:18,481 --> 00:03:22,145
Jong Pil? Isn't that...

59
00:03:22,385 --> 00:03:24,045
Eun Seop's dad's name?

60
00:03:24,921 --> 00:03:26,615
Who's looking for him?

61
00:03:28,358 --> 00:03:29,620
You have to do it right this time.

62
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:32,015
I get it. Be quiet.

63
00:03:34,998 --> 00:03:36,060
I'm not going easy on you.

64
00:03:36,066 --> 00:03:38,800
Cosmos... It's 17 dollars.

65
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:40,625
Please sign here.

66
00:03:41,238 --> 00:03:42,770
Hey, take your delivery case off the pool table.

67
00:03:42,772 --> 00:03:44,940
- I get it, I get it. - You brat.

68
00:03:44,941 --> 00:03:46,740
Hurry up and hit it.

69
00:03:46,743 --> 00:03:49,040
Give me a second. I need to calculate the angle.

70
00:03:49,045 --> 00:03:51,640
What's there to calculate? Just hit it.

71
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,135
Take this and leave.

72
00:03:53,883 --> 00:03:55,210
Isn't that Jong Pil over there?

73
00:03:55,218 --> 00:03:56,980
Someone was looking for him.

74
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:58,850
- Come on, hit it. - I'm leaving.

75
00:03:58,855 --> 00:04:00,390
Just hit it like this.

76
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:02,490
My goodness.

77
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:03,985
Hey!

78
00:04:04,094 --> 00:04:05,715
Jong Pil!

79
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:08,985
What?

80
00:04:09,399 --> 00:04:11,025
Come here.

81
00:04:11,935 --> 00:04:14,400
Someone was looking for me?

82
00:04:14,404 --> 00:04:15,895
Yes.

83
00:04:16,106 --> 00:04:19,765
At the bus terminal.

84
00:04:20,377 --> 00:04:21,865
Who?

85
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:25,180
Well, they did mention...

86
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:28,675
he looked like that man. You know, Eun Seop's...

87
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:37,285
Hey, don't think you can run away.

88
00:04:37,594 --> 00:04:40,330
We're going to Jin Ju's for another drink.

89
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:41,390
Let's go.

90
00:04:41,398 --> 00:04:42,890
Jong Pil, come on.

91
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:45,355
- Are you guys done? - Yes.

92
00:04:46,836 --> 00:04:49,895
All right, thanks.

93
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:55,665
Lim Hwi!

94
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,135
Hey, Hwi!

95
00:05:01,451 --> 00:05:03,045
What's taking her so long?

96
00:05:06,589 --> 00:05:08,950
Lim Hwi!

97
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:11,360
Lim as in "limbo".

98
00:05:11,361 --> 00:05:13,755
Hwi as in "whistle"!

99
00:05:14,964 --> 00:05:16,685
Lim Hwi!

100
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,665
Hey, Kwon Hyun Ji! Hyun Ji!

101
00:05:22,605 --> 00:05:24,595
Gosh, it's freezing.

102
00:05:30,814 --> 00:05:32,375
Who's that man?

103
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:36,110
My gosh, do you have a crush on me or something?

104
00:05:36,119 --> 00:05:38,175
- Gosh, that's no good. - Shut it.

105
00:05:54,304 --> 00:05:56,625
- What? - Let's go.

106
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:00,940
Isn't this the first time we're locking arms like this?

107
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:03,270
Gosh, be quiet.

108
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:05,005
Goodness.

109
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:02,865
Lim Eun Seop.

110
00:07:08,211 --> 00:07:10,065
Eun Seop.

111
00:07:11,247 --> 00:07:13,610
Wake up. Wake up and play with me.

112
00:07:13,616 --> 00:07:16,575
I'm bored. Please?

113
00:07:20,089 --> 00:07:21,785
Eun Seop.

114
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,285
Lim Eun Seop?

115
00:07:43,012 --> 00:07:44,735
Here.

116
00:07:48,518 --> 00:07:50,145
Hae Won.

117
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,075
- Was it good? - What did you do?

118
00:07:53,089 --> 00:07:54,690
How does it taste?

119
00:07:54,691 --> 00:07:57,085
It tastes weird.

120
00:08:06,836 --> 00:08:08,100
Get up already.

121
00:08:08,104 --> 00:08:10,195
You're so mean.

122
00:08:37,567 --> 00:08:39,055
What?

123
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:42,225
You're glowing.

124
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:43,895
What?

125
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,865
Never mind.

126
00:08:48,311 --> 00:08:50,070
- Eun Seop. - Yes.

127
00:08:50,079 --> 00:08:52,375
Shall I cook something for you?

128
00:08:52,715 --> 00:08:54,445
What? You?

129
00:08:54,551 --> 00:08:56,575
What's with that reaction?

130
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:59,475
I'm a good cook. Well, I'm at least better than my auntie.

131
00:09:02,258 --> 00:09:04,055
I'm serious.

132
00:09:04,227 --> 00:09:06,415
I don't put ham in soybean paste stew.

133
00:09:11,568 --> 00:09:13,125
It's too fishy.

134
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:15,900
Oh, dear.

135
00:09:15,905 --> 00:09:18,935
What exactly went wrong?

136
00:09:27,617 --> 00:09:29,105
Hey.

137
00:09:29,719 --> 00:09:34,515
Well, it was practically impossible to obtain your cell phone number.

138
00:09:34,724 --> 00:09:38,415
You're obviously very serious about protecting your private life.

139
00:09:38,962 --> 00:09:41,185
Just cut to the chase, Crybaby.

140
00:09:43,099 --> 00:09:45,900
I'm calling about the contract. What will you do?

141
00:09:45,902 --> 00:09:49,925
I can't wait forever, you know.

142
00:09:50,239 --> 00:09:51,795
Oh, that.

143
00:09:52,609 --> 00:09:54,440
So what's your decision?

144
00:09:54,444 --> 00:09:56,535
Will you do it or not?

145
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,575
I'll do it.

146
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:01,580
What? You'll do it?

147
00:10:01,584 --> 00:10:02,950
I won't if you have a problem with it.

148
00:10:02,952 --> 00:10:05,075
No, no. It's not that.

149
00:10:05,121 --> 00:10:06,750
I don't have any problem with it.

150
00:10:06,756 --> 00:10:09,020
Then send the contract via registered mail, Crybaby.

151
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,320
Within a week.

152
00:10:10,326 --> 00:10:12,955
Hey, hold on. Wait.

153
00:10:14,664 --> 00:10:16,755
You see, we normally...

154
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:20,430
don't send contracts via registered mail.

155
00:10:20,436 --> 00:10:24,025
Then what do you use? Pigeon post?

156
00:10:24,474 --> 00:10:27,410
Well, our company culture is...

157
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:30,610
Everyone here loves meeting people.

158
00:10:30,613 --> 00:10:34,405
That's why I always have in-person meetings back-to-back.

159
00:10:35,351 --> 00:10:37,275
Why don't you...

160
00:10:38,655 --> 00:10:41,590
Come by my office whenever you have some time.

161
00:10:41,591 --> 00:10:43,250
I'm very busy,

162
00:10:43,259 --> 00:10:45,620
but I'll make some time just for you.

163
00:10:45,628 --> 00:10:48,330
It's on Hoedong-gil in Paju...

164
00:10:48,331 --> 00:10:49,690
6:18am.

165
00:10:49,699 --> 00:10:53,000
9:18am, 12:18pm, 3:18pm, 6:18pm,

166
00:10:53,002 --> 00:10:55,430
and 9:18pm.

167
00:10:55,438 --> 00:10:57,535
Those are the train times to my town.

168
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:00,270
Hey, are you saying...

169
00:11:00,276 --> 00:11:02,940
I should come to where you are?

170
00:11:02,945 --> 00:11:04,740
I guess you don't get it.

171
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:07,375
The one who's asking for a favor should travel.

172
00:11:07,817 --> 00:11:09,375
Hey, Myeong Yeo...

173
00:11:09,385 --> 00:11:10,850
Hello?

174
00:11:10,853 --> 00:11:12,745
Are you signing a contract for a book?

175
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,150
When did you get in?

176
00:11:15,158 --> 00:11:18,215
Just now. Are you signing a contract for a book?

177
00:11:18,461 --> 00:11:20,730
Yes, I am.

178
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:23,660
But you made a big deal about not wanting to write anymore.

179
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:25,400
You said you couldn't think of anything to write about.

180
00:11:25,401 --> 00:11:27,830
You went on about how your creative well has dried up.

181
00:11:27,837 --> 00:11:29,830
What's gotten into you?

182
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,670
When you've hit rock bottom,

183
00:11:31,674 --> 00:11:33,770
the only way to go is up.

184
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:36,640
I've been hit by poverty.

185
00:11:36,646 --> 00:11:39,710
Speaking of which, why are you taking those?

186
00:11:39,716 --> 00:11:42,780
I see you holding my carrots,

187
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:46,975
my potatoes, and my tomatoes. It's bothering me a lot.

188
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:50,415
Oh, these? I bought these.

189
00:11:50,426 --> 00:11:52,560
- You bought them? - Yes.

190
00:11:52,562 --> 00:11:55,930
I bought them while staying at Eun Seop's place, so they're mine.

191
00:11:55,932 --> 00:11:58,295
I see. You bought them.

192
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:02,030
I have to say, I'm really curious about your new book.

193
00:12:02,038 --> 00:12:04,770
I don't know about other things, but I'm a fan of your novels.

194
00:12:04,774 --> 00:12:07,535
- When the book comes out, let's... - Hey.

195
00:12:09,445 --> 00:12:11,675
Winter will be over soon.

196
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:16,945
Shouldn't you wake up from your hibernation?

197
00:12:17,253 --> 00:12:19,745
Didn't you initially say you'd go back in spring?

198
00:12:28,197 --> 00:12:30,755
What? Who?

199
00:12:31,267 --> 00:12:34,765
Oh, Eun Seop's biological father.

200
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:37,070
Mom, where's my gym shirt?

201
00:12:37,073 --> 00:12:41,105
Oh, it's in the bottom drawer.

202
00:12:42,712 --> 00:12:44,740
But he's dead.

203
00:12:44,747 --> 00:12:47,550
Then who else would it be?

204
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:50,745
The uncle?

205
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:54,885
Well, I think so.

206
00:12:55,892 --> 00:12:57,420
But everyone in the village...

207
00:12:57,426 --> 00:13:00,020
is gossiping about Eun Seop's biological father being back.

208
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:02,090
What? They're gossiping about it?

209
00:13:02,098 --> 00:13:04,225
My gosh.

210
00:13:04,267 --> 00:13:06,860
Goodness, this darned place.

211
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:09,730
I never liked this place.

212
00:13:09,739 --> 00:13:11,370
This tiny town.

213
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:13,640
When anything happens,

214
00:13:13,643 --> 00:13:15,270
people gather and gossip.

215
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:19,910
They gossip about the vagrant that lives in the mountains.

216
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:22,180
When he comes into town to do some work,

217
00:13:22,185 --> 00:13:24,920
they gossip about that too.

218
00:13:24,921 --> 00:13:28,220
Whether that man had a little boy or not...

219
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,090
was also a topic of their gossip.

220
00:13:30,092 --> 00:13:32,990
The same goes for whether we took that boy in or not.

221
00:13:32,995 --> 00:13:34,560
They gossip about everything!

222
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:37,860
I mean, that man died years ago.

223
00:13:37,867 --> 00:13:40,300
I can't believe these people still remember that man's face.

224
00:13:40,303 --> 00:13:43,730
Goodness, I'm so sick and tired of this.

225
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:45,265
Gosh.

226
00:13:45,341 --> 00:13:48,870
By the way,

227
00:13:48,878 --> 00:13:51,775
why is that man looking for you?

228
00:13:52,281 --> 00:13:55,650
Well, I suppose he wants to ask where Eun Seop is.

229
00:13:55,651 --> 00:13:58,445
Something like that, I assume.

230
00:13:59,322 --> 00:14:01,590
But he hasn't shown up yet,

231
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:05,015
so maybe he already went to the bookstore.

232
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:08,530
Why would he go there? Why?

233
00:14:08,531 --> 00:14:10,530
What would he do there? What now?

234
00:14:10,533 --> 00:14:12,260
To extort money from Eun Seop again?

235
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:15,600
Even last time, he took a lot of money from Eun Seop,

236
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:17,870
saying that he wants to buy a boat.

237
00:14:17,874 --> 00:14:20,400
When he hurt his leg, he said he needed money to pay hospital bills.

238
00:14:20,409 --> 00:14:22,770
What kind of excuse will he give this time?

239
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:24,740
Gosh, Eun Seop doesn't even have much money.

240
00:14:24,747 --> 00:14:26,310
Why does he keep showing up?

241
00:14:26,315 --> 00:14:28,010
Gosh, no way.

242
00:14:28,017 --> 00:14:29,680
I'm sure he won't do that again.

243
00:14:29,685 --> 00:14:32,150
Okay, fine. Money isn't important.

244
00:14:32,154 --> 00:14:34,175
What worries me is how he keeps...

245
00:14:35,224 --> 00:14:38,420
He keeps asking Eun Seop to go out to the sea with him...

246
00:14:38,427 --> 00:14:40,560
Mom, Dad. I'm going to school.

247
00:14:40,563 --> 00:14:41,790
All right, Hwi.

248
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:45,355
- Okay, have a good day! - I will.

249
00:14:54,043 --> 00:14:55,935
What are you talking about?

250
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:01,550
But he's dead.

251
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:03,950
Then who else would it be?

252
00:15:03,953 --> 00:15:06,975
The uncle?

253
00:15:40,323 --> 00:15:41,815
Hey!

255

Has it been five years?

256
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:49,950
It was before you went to do your military service.

257
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:51,785
That's the last time we met, right?

258
00:16:52,862 --> 00:16:54,355
Yes.

259
00:16:56,899 --> 00:16:59,095
- Did you buy the boat? - No.

260
00:17:00,036 --> 00:17:01,695
I didn't.

261
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,105
But...

262
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:12,035
I did find this.

263
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:14,435
Do you have this too?

264
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,295
It was taken on the same day.

265
00:17:33,836 --> 00:17:35,795
I took this picture.

266
00:17:42,845 --> 00:17:47,035
I need you to come with me right now.

267
00:17:47,116 --> 00:17:50,575
- Where? - It's a bit far from here.

268
00:17:51,187 --> 00:17:53,180
- If we have to sail there, I... - Well...

269
00:17:53,189 --> 00:17:56,115
I guess...

270
00:17:57,126 --> 00:17:59,585
it's something like that.

271
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:11,125
Get yourself together, son.

272
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,235
I'm the only family you have.

273
00:18:13,442 --> 00:18:15,105
Can't you see?

274
00:18:15,644 --> 00:18:17,370
The blood flowing in your veins...

275
00:18:17,379 --> 00:18:20,110
and the blood flowing in mine are the same.

276
00:18:20,116 --> 00:18:22,545
That's why we have a connection.

277
00:18:22,751 --> 00:18:25,180
You came back for your mom.

278
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:29,450
You stayed by her side nursing her for three years, right?

279
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:31,815
You know what that means?

280
00:18:32,428 --> 00:18:34,485
In the end, it's all about family.

281

Do you understand?

282
00:18:37,099 --> 00:18:38,930
You still act politely...

283
00:18:38,934 --> 00:18:42,430
and courteously to those parents of yours, right?

284
00:18:42,438 --> 00:18:46,365
You do that because they are not your real family.

285
00:18:52,615 --> 00:18:54,505
Because they are not your real family.

286
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:01,990
What?

287
00:19:01,991 --> 00:19:05,320
What? "Real"? Real what?

288
00:19:05,327 --> 00:19:06,990
Goodness, that dog...

Tell me.

I have to go somewhere.

00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:49,365
Where?

302
00:19:53,075 --> 00:19:54,705
Just someplace...

303
00:19:55,544 --> 00:19:57,840
I might not come back today.

304
00:19:57,846 --> 00:20:00,375

You stay right there! You're dead meat if you leave!

- Mom! - Why you...

314
00:20:24,607 --> 00:20:26,800
Why did you come back from school?

315
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:29,640
- Are you skipping school again? - No...

- Wait. - I told you.

317
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,550
At least be diligent in school if you can't get good grades.

That uncle or whatever came over...

323
00:20:45,628 --> 00:20:47,885
and told him to follow him.

324
00:20:47,963 --> 00:20:49,390
He didn't ask for money?

325
00:20:49,398 --> 00:20:50,590

really follow him?

He followed him without hesitation.

00:21:58,233 --> 00:21:59,895
Hey, I'm here.

338
00:22:00,269 --> 00:22:02,200
- Hi. Let's go. - A flea market?

339
00:22:02,204 --> 00:22:05,270
Yes. It sounds like fun.

340
00:22:05,274 --> 00:22:06,270
(A few days ago)

341
00:22:06,275 --> 00:22:09,570
Everyone. Let's host an event.

342
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,680
What kind of event, Su Jeong?

343
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,910
A flea market.

344
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:14,775
"A flea market"?

345
00:22:14,817 --> 00:22:19,220
Are you giving us an idea for a city hall event?

346
00:22:19,221 --> 00:22:21,450
I was thinking on a much smaller scale.

347
00:22:21,457 --> 00:22:22,920
What's a "flea market"?

348
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:24,890
I know what it is. I totally do.

349
00:22:24,893 --> 00:22:27,160
It's like sharing, exchanging, and reusing things.

350
00:22:27,162 --> 00:22:29,230
No, that's not it Hwi.

351
00:22:29,231 --> 00:22:31,700
Su Jeong, a flea market is...

352
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,860
selling things you don't use.

353
00:22:33,869 --> 00:22:36,030
Right. Oh, that's right.

354
00:22:36,038 --> 00:22:37,500
That's not good.

355
00:22:37,506 --> 00:22:39,635
I use everything I have.

356
00:22:40,909 --> 00:22:44,640
You can also sell things that you're good at making too.

357
00:22:44,646 --> 00:22:45,880
Right, Eun Seop?

358
00:22:45,881 --> 00:22:47,375
Right.

We have more for everyone.

Why are you so mad, Hyun Ji? Brighten up a bit, okay?

367
00:23:17,112 --> 00:23:19,775
- Only for today. - That looks good.

368
00:23:19,915 --> 00:23:23,410
How about selling your pies or quilts, Auntie Su Jeong?

369
00:23:23,419 --> 00:23:25,545
Five dollars for you, Miss.

370
00:23:25,954 --> 00:23:28,045
I think a lot of people will buy it.

371

What about me?

372
00:23:30,459 --> 00:23:33,560
Hyun Ji, just go with calligraphy. You're good at that.

What would you like for me to write?

375

Well... Can you write this for my son?

376
00:23:39,735 --> 00:23:43,130
"Jun Yeong, mommy loves you."

377

Try it.

384
00:23:59,822 --> 00:24:01,420
It looks tasty.

385

gave up and left too.

That's why I want to live with you now.

You and I are both going to leave eventually.

502

Shouldn't we stick together until then?

That way, we wouldn't have to get hurt.

What?

505
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:39,045
Do you think...

506
00:30:39,621 --> 00:30:41,545
you're any different?

Hey, aren't they amazing?

509
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:46,850
The City of Hyecheon...

510
00:31:46,855 --> 00:31:49,890
educates those incredibly talented kids.

511
00:31:49,891 --> 00:31:51,860
Those extraordinarily talented kids...

512
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:52,890
Hear me out.

513
00:31:52,894 --> 00:31:55,330
They learned how to play those instruments at school.

514
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,325
- Jang Woo. - Yes?

515
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:59,160
I'm trying to focus here.

516
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:01,800
Sure, I'm trying to focus too.

517
00:32:01,803 --> 00:32:03,825
- Please be quiet. - All right.

518
00:32:07,475 --> 00:32:10,905
Aren't they fantastic? Fine, I get it.

519
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:20,080
Did you enjoy that?

520
00:32:20,088 --> 00:32:21,380
- Yes. - Yes.

00:32:21,389 --> 00:32:23,490
For 30 years...

522
00:32:23,491 --> 00:32:25,690
Can you play for us?

523
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:28,120
- What? - You're a cellist too, aren't you?

524
00:32:28,129 --> 00:32:29,260
Play for us.

525
00:32:29,264 --> 00:32:30,330
I am, but...

526
00:32:30,332 --> 00:32:31,900
Please, Hae Won. I'd love to hear it.

527
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,000
- Please don't do this. - Please.

528
00:32:34,002 --> 00:32:35,870
- I can't. - Ji Yeon.

529
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,930
Excuse me. Ji Yeon!

530
00:32:37,939 --> 00:32:39,570
- Ji Yeon! - Hey.

531
00:32:39,574 --> 00:32:41,600
- Hae Won wants to play too. - Be quiet.

532
00:32:41,609 --> 00:32:44,370
- Please. She plays the cello. - Ji Yeon, ignore him.

533
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:45,540
- She wants to play for us. - Ignore him.

534
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:46,910
You know how Jang Woo is.

535
00:32:46,915 --> 00:32:50,080
- Hae Won is an amazing cellist. - Don't listen to him. Never mind.

536
00:32:50,085 --> 00:32:51,380
- She wants to play the cello. - No.

537

Eun Seop.

540
00:34:19,374 --> 00:34:22,035
What's wrong? You seem upset. Did something happen?

541
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:32,475
Some people...

542
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:35,115
are meant to be alone...

543

from birth to death.

00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:42,385
So am I.

545
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,955
It's in our blood.

546
00:34:48,269 --> 00:34:49,765
In our blood.

547
00:34:56,311 --> 00:34:58,235
We're meant to be alone...

548
00:34:59,114 --> 00:35:01,875
all our lives.

549
00:35:01,883 --> 00:35:03,375
We're meant to be that way.

550
00:35:16,564 --> 00:35:18,030
Just because.

551
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:19,655
What do you mean?

552
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:23,395
I was just thinking... What if you vanish all of a sudden?

553
00:35:46,761 --> 00:35:48,255
What?

554
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:50,655
Do you think...

555
00:35:51,132 --> 00:35:52,955
you're any different?

(Hyecheon, Gangneung)

557
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:12,950
That train ride sent me...

558
00:36:12,954 --> 00:36:14,875
on a trip down memory lane.

559
00:36:14,956 --> 00:36:17,520
We used to ride the train very often.

560
00:36:17,525 --> 00:36:20,460
We did. And you cried every single time.

561
00:36:20,461 --> 00:36:22,290
"I love you, Myeong Yeo. I'm sorry, Myeong Yeo."

562
00:36:22,297 --> 00:36:25,200
Sniff, sniff. Sobbing and crying.

563
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,600
I meant every word I said to you.

564
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:29,865
Oh, is that so?

565
00:36:30,738 --> 00:36:32,000
This clause here.

566
00:36:32,006 --> 00:36:34,200
Take this out, and I'll sign the contract.

567
00:36:34,209 --> 00:36:35,310
(This book must be based on personal experience)

568
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:38,640
I can't take that out. It'll be the most interesting aspect.

569
00:36:38,646 --> 00:36:41,410
No. To me, it won't be interesting at all.

570
00:36:41,416 --> 00:36:42,950
Who are you to decide that?

571
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:44,850
I make the call because I'm the chief editor.

572
00:36:44,852 --> 00:36:47,420
Look. When someone's house in on fire,

573
00:36:47,422 --> 00:36:48,890
the spectators may get a kick out of it,

574
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:50,720
but it's a nightmare to those locked inside the house.

575
00:36:50,725 --> 00:36:52,385
Why don't you know that?

576
00:36:52,794 --> 00:36:56,785
I cannot write about such a horrible nightmare.

577
00:36:58,399 --> 00:36:59,895
Then...

578
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:03,230
- why don't you mix it up? - What?

579
00:37:03,238 --> 00:37:05,400
Mix fiction with nonfiction.

580
00:37:05,406 --> 00:37:07,100
Who cares? I wouldn't know...

581
00:37:07,108 --> 00:37:10,065
which part is fiction and which part isn't.

582
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:14,940
If that's the case...

583
00:37:14,949 --> 00:37:17,150
I will never ask you which parts are based on facts...

584
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:19,875
and which parts are fictitious.

585
00:37:19,954 --> 00:37:21,445
We're good now, right?

586
00:37:23,191 --> 00:37:25,015
Here.

587
00:37:27,195 --> 00:37:29,955
I need your signature here.

588
00:37:30,565 --> 00:37:31,690
What is this?

589
00:37:31,699 --> 00:37:35,060
I knew you'd pull this on me, so I brought an alternative version.

590
00:37:35,069 --> 00:37:37,570
This contract entails what we just discussed.

591
00:37:37,572 --> 00:37:41,365
This is what a competent chief editor does, you know?

592
00:37:50,885 --> 00:37:52,950
That's the one you just took out.

593
00:37:52,954 --> 00:37:54,445
What?

594
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:56,750
What? Hold on.

595
00:37:56,758 --> 00:37:57,920
You believe that?

596
00:37:57,925 --> 00:38:00,585
- I fooled you again. - Gosh, seriously.

597
00:38:00,962 --> 00:38:02,455
Goodness.

598
00:38:02,897 --> 00:38:05,060
Wasn't it so much fun?

599
00:38:05,066 --> 00:38:06,960
Yes, it was really fun.

600
00:38:06,968 --> 00:38:08,830
Well, I did sell them cheap.

601
00:38:08,836 --> 00:38:11,130
But I got rid of a lot of the old inventory.

602
00:38:11,139 --> 00:38:13,970
So all in all, it was great.

603
00:38:13,975 --> 00:38:15,640
I've made up my mind.

604
00:38:15,643 --> 00:38:17,540
I'm going to open a pie shop.

605
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:20,475
I'll call it Crystal Pie.

606
00:38:21,249 --> 00:38:22,880
But I have to say,

607
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:25,350
I was so impressed by Hae Won's cello performance.

608
00:38:25,353 --> 00:38:26,845
Me too!

609
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:29,320
I've never seen that before.

610
00:38:29,324 --> 00:38:31,920
Same here. I've seen my classmates fiddle with the cello,

611
00:38:31,926 --> 00:38:34,090
but Hae Won is obviously on another level.

612
00:38:34,095 --> 00:38:35,585
Agreed.

613
00:38:35,596 --> 00:38:39,200
I want to learn something like that too, Hae Won.

614
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,530
Really?

615
00:38:40,535 --> 00:38:43,495
By the way, Uncle Eun Seop isn't here yet.

616
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:47,095
Gosh, I know.

617
00:38:47,175 --> 00:38:49,340
I wish he was there with us.

618
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:51,365
Right? Totally.

619
00:38:51,546 --> 00:38:54,410
Gosh, I told you he isn't coming.

620
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:56,705
Hwi, you'll burn your clothes.

621
00:38:57,485 --> 00:38:59,450
It's getting late. We should all get going.

622
00:38:59,454 --> 00:39:01,880
- All right. - It feels empty here without him.

623
00:39:01,889 --> 00:39:03,590
- I know. - Where are you all going?

624
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:05,445
We're not done yet.

625
00:39:07,662 --> 00:39:09,090
Doesn't the composition look weird?

626
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:11,760
- Yes, a little. - I think it moved.

627
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:13,700
- Are we doing it now? - Hey, Hae Won. Yes, we are.

628
00:39:13,701 --> 00:39:15,030
- Hold on. - Can I stand here?

629
00:39:15,036 --> 00:39:18,025
Yes, that's perfect. It looks perfect now.

630
00:39:18,506 --> 00:39:20,070
All right, let's do this.

631
00:39:20,074 --> 00:39:21,540
Wait! Don't forget about me!

632
00:39:21,542 --> 00:39:23,335
- Gosh, seriously. - I'm coming.

633
00:39:23,578 --> 00:39:26,310
- Here? - A little more to the left.

634
00:39:26,314 --> 00:39:27,940
Okay, that's it. Stop right there.

635
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:29,745
Okay.

636
00:39:31,986 --> 00:39:34,050
Hae Won, why are you holding a rag?

637
00:39:34,055 --> 00:39:36,845
Seung Ho, you should look at the camera.

638
00:39:36,991 --> 00:39:39,190
Was that it? I think I closed my eyes.

639
00:39:39,193 --> 00:39:40,985
I think I'll look good in this one.

640
00:39:45,533 --> 00:39:48,100
Jang Woo, you should get going. I can organize the rest alone.

641
00:39:48,102 --> 00:39:49,470
It's okay. I'll just finish this.

642
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:51,200
Eun Seop talked my ear off,

643
00:39:51,205 --> 00:39:54,195
so I can't just leave.

644
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:58,035
- Hey, Hae Won. - Yes?

645
00:39:58,513 --> 00:40:01,405
How are you doing these days?

646
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:06,675
You seemed to have a lot on your mind.

647
00:40:08,256 --> 00:40:09,745
Oh, right.

648
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:12,345
I had been feeling a little frustrated,

649
00:40:12,527 --> 00:40:14,215
but I'm okay now.

650
00:40:15,229 --> 00:40:18,455
Living in Seoul is exhausting, isn't it?

651
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:22,300
I used to feel frustrated from time to time as well.

652
00:40:22,303 --> 00:40:25,670
I felt like I couldn't digest anything when I had to eat alone.

653
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:29,535
And hanging out with friends didn't make my loneliness go away.

654
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:31,505
But you see,

655
00:40:31,879 --> 00:40:34,605
I remember them as fond memories now that time has passed.

656
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:38,010
"Memories"?

657
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:40,780
Yes, just like you're...

658
00:40:40,788 --> 00:40:43,245
building memories here.

659
00:40:43,624 --> 00:40:45,615
I remember my experience in Seoul...

660
00:40:45,927 --> 00:40:48,255
very fondly.

661
00:40:50,498 --> 00:40:52,455
Where should I put this?

662
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:55,800
- Hae Won. - Yes?

663
00:40:55,803 --> 00:40:57,670
Where should I put this?

664
00:40:57,672 --> 00:41:00,740
Oh, can you take it to the storage room?

665
00:41:00,741 --> 00:41:02,470
The storage room? I came from there.

666
00:41:02,477 --> 00:41:04,365
I wish you had told me sooner.

667
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:06,780
As for the light bulbs, can you leave them in the front yard?

668
00:41:06,781 --> 00:41:08,410
- Leave them outside? - Yes.

669
00:41:08,416 --> 00:41:10,780
Then I have to separate them. I wish you had told me sooner.

670
00:41:10,785 --> 00:41:13,115
Oh, and bring those books back.

671
00:41:13,821 --> 00:41:15,315
All right.

672
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:16,985
Thanks.

673
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:21,855
Even if that's the case,

674
00:41:24,365 --> 00:41:26,525
I can't let him go, honey.

675
00:41:30,771 --> 00:41:32,265
I don't want to.

676
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,765
I will stop him.

677
00:41:35,776 --> 00:41:37,935
I'll tell him not to leave.

678
00:41:38,846 --> 00:41:41,075
I'll beg him.

679
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:46,545
We should let him go if he wants to leave.

680
00:41:47,655 --> 00:41:51,320
How could you say that so easily?

681
00:41:51,325 --> 00:41:53,585
Eun Seop is not our...

682
00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:58,030
He's not our son, you know.

683
00:41:58,032 --> 00:41:59,555
You see,

684
00:42:00,234 --> 00:42:02,530
I still remember the day you brought him home...

685
00:42:02,537 --> 00:42:04,300
and told me not to get too attached to him...

686
00:42:04,305 --> 00:42:06,470
because he's not our child,

687
00:42:06,474 --> 00:42:08,665
but I just couldn't do that.

688
00:42:09,043 --> 00:42:11,335
I mean, how is that possible?

689
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:13,980
He ate with us and slept by our side.

690
00:42:13,981 --> 00:42:15,010
That little boy always fell asleep...

691
00:42:15,016 --> 00:42:16,950
in my arms,

692
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:19,250
so how... How can I treat him like a stranger?

693
00:42:19,253 --> 00:42:20,750
He is my son.

694
00:42:20,755 --> 00:42:22,415
Don't you agree?

695
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:24,615
Apparently, we should treat him like a stranger.

696
00:42:27,695 --> 00:42:30,130
Everyone in this town is saying that.

697
00:42:30,131 --> 00:42:31,655
You see,

698
00:42:33,534 --> 00:42:37,265
even when he left us for three years to look after his mother...

699
00:42:37,471 --> 00:42:40,365
and be there for her in her final moments,

700
00:42:40,374 --> 00:42:42,335
I trusted him.

701
00:42:42,543 --> 00:42:44,505
I really did.

702
00:42:45,413 --> 00:42:47,810
That he would come back one day.

703
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:50,175
Even when...

704
00:42:50,384 --> 00:42:52,480
Eun Seop never gave us...

705
00:42:52,486 --> 00:42:54,850
one phone call during those three years.

706
00:42:54,855 --> 00:42:57,420
You told me numerous times that Eun Seop...

707
00:42:57,425 --> 00:43:00,190
would not return.

708
00:43:00,194 --> 00:43:03,255
Not me.

709
00:43:03,264 --> 00:43:06,025
I had complete trust in him.

710
00:43:08,336 --> 00:43:11,300
And he came back to us.

711
00:43:11,305 --> 00:43:12,770
Back to us.

712
00:43:12,773 --> 00:43:14,670
He is with us now.

713
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:17,105
But still, family...

714
00:43:21,115 --> 00:43:23,375
Blood is thicker than water.

715
00:43:23,951 --> 00:43:25,775
"Blood"?

716
00:43:26,554 --> 00:43:28,445
Is that the same for you as well?

717
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:32,020
Is that how you define family?

718
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:34,290
Is having a blood-related family that important to you?

719
00:43:34,295 --> 00:43:37,830
So did you only adore and love Hwi as your child?

720
00:43:37,832 --> 00:43:39,355
No!

721
00:43:41,302 --> 00:43:42,825
That's not true.

722
00:44:55,576 --> 00:44:57,505
Just once.

723
00:44:58,612 --> 00:45:00,475
Could you tell me...

724
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:03,745
just once?

725
00:45:05,453 --> 00:45:06,945
Please?

726
00:45:10,324 --> 00:45:12,415
I wanted to tell you...

727
00:45:14,895 --> 00:45:16,760
that I love you.

728
00:45:16,764 --> 00:45:18,360
Hey.

729
00:45:18,365 --> 00:45:19,360
You're hungry, right?

730
00:45:19,366 --> 00:45:21,995
That I really love you.

731
00:45:22,002 --> 00:45:23,500
What's this?

732
00:45:23,504 --> 00:45:26,870
Oh, my goodness. This is...

733
00:45:26,874 --> 00:45:28,070
Oh, goodness.

734
00:45:28,075 --> 00:45:31,210
This is my favorite.

735
00:45:31,212 --> 00:45:34,075
It's a rhino beetle, right?

736
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:38,845
Did you bring this to show it to me?

737
00:45:40,855 --> 00:45:42,620
Goodness, it's such a rare kind.

738
00:45:42,623 --> 00:45:46,385
I haven't seen one in ages.

739
00:45:50,364 --> 00:45:51,960
Hold on to it for a moment.

740
00:45:51,966 --> 00:45:54,230
You must be hungry. I'll set the table for you soon.

741
00:45:54,235 --> 00:45:56,695
Wait a minute. You must be hungry.

742
00:45:58,405 --> 00:46:01,570
Hwi, look. Your brother brought...

743
00:46:01,575 --> 00:46:06,205
such a rare beetle to show it to mommy.

744
00:46:14,722 --> 00:46:16,315
Hwi.

745
00:46:16,524 --> 00:46:18,715
Your name is Hwi.

746
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:21,385
Hwi as in "whistle".

747
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:24,230
Goodness, Eun Seop.

748
00:46:24,231 --> 00:46:27,125
You've been here for two hours already.

749
00:46:27,835 --> 00:46:29,625
Do you like her that much?

750
00:46:31,572 --> 00:46:33,265
Mommy...

751
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:39,535
Honey.

752
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:42,175
Are you okay?

753
00:46:46,387 --> 00:46:48,815
I'm watching a drama.

754
00:46:56,263 --> 00:46:58,825
I wanted to tell you that I missed you.

755
00:46:59,266 --> 00:47:01,425
That I'm sorry.

756
00:47:02,436 --> 00:47:04,895
But I couldn't tell you any of that.

757
00:47:23,224 --> 00:47:25,285
Come here, Hwi.

758
00:47:56,323 --> 00:47:58,120
You're going to leave anyway.

759
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:01,585
Forget about it. Whatever, just go.

760
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:05,330
Don't touch my bicycle.

761
00:48:05,332 --> 00:48:08,295
If you're going to leave anyway, don't dare leave a thumbprint on it.

762
00:48:10,104 --> 00:48:14,665
Go on that boat and sail across all the way to the Pacific, okay?

763
00:48:15,376 --> 00:48:17,410
Who cares if I sail on a boat...

764
00:48:17,411 --> 00:48:19,635
or disappear?

765
00:48:19,713 --> 00:48:22,505
You never liked me.

766
00:48:22,516 --> 00:48:24,675
Since I was born!

767
00:48:25,686 --> 00:48:27,750
I liked you since I was born.

768
00:48:27,755 --> 00:48:29,250
When I was a crying baby.

769
00:48:29,256 --> 00:48:30,990
When I saw the world for the first time.

770
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:33,515
I've liked you ever since then, you idiot!

771
00:48:33,894 --> 00:48:35,755
"Don't cry."

772
00:48:36,397 --> 00:48:38,425
"I won't leave."

773
00:48:39,366 --> 00:48:40,800
Why?

774
00:48:40,801 --> 00:48:43,965
Why is it so hard to utter these sentences?

775
00:48:44,071 --> 00:48:46,565
Because you're my brother.

776
00:48:46,573 --> 00:48:48,040
Because you're my brother!

777
00:48:48,042 --> 00:48:51,340
Because you were already my brother when I was born.

778
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:54,980
So I liked you since the beginning. What do you want me to do?

779
00:48:54,982 --> 00:48:56,780
I hate you, Eun Seop.

780
00:48:56,784 --> 00:48:58,580
I hate you so much, Eun Seop.

781
00:48:58,585 --> 00:49:01,645
Get lost, get on that boat!

782
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:12,160
Whatever. I don't even know.

783
00:49:12,166 --> 00:49:14,725
I'm going to tell Mom and Dad everything.

784
00:49:14,902 --> 00:49:16,670
Mom, Dad! Eun Seop is...

785
00:49:16,670 --> 00:49:18,695
- This one's expensive. - being mean.

786
00:49:24,545 --> 00:49:26,035
How expensive?

787
00:49:26,113 --> 00:49:28,505
- Was it very expensive? - Yes.

788
00:49:29,316 --> 00:49:31,975
I wanted to treat you big time and bought it downtown.

789
00:49:32,653 --> 00:49:34,545
It's been a while...

790
00:49:34,555 --> 00:49:37,515
since you spent money on me.

791
00:49:39,126 --> 00:49:41,490
This was what I wanted.

792
00:49:41,495 --> 00:49:43,360
Yes, this was it.

793
00:49:43,364 --> 00:49:45,130
I thought it was 30 dollars,

794
00:49:45,132 --> 00:49:47,625
but it was 300 dollars.

795
00:49:48,202 --> 00:49:51,495
I guess you're rich, Eun Seop.

796
00:49:51,505 --> 00:49:54,070
Next time, just give it to me in cash.

797
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:56,910
A student doesn't need such an expensive saddle.

798
00:49:56,910 --> 00:50:00,280
There's so much you can do with 300 dollars.

799
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:01,875
Excuse me?

800
00:50:02,516 --> 00:50:04,580
Don't laugh, you lunatic!

801
00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:08,645
You're ridiculing me if you laugh when I'm crying.

802
00:50:09,156 --> 00:50:10,815
Get out!

803
00:50:15,763 --> 00:50:18,555
Oh, this is good.

804
00:50:20,634 --> 00:50:23,895
Oh, nice. This is really great, Eun Seop.

805
00:50:28,375 --> 00:50:31,535
It's so nice! Okay!

806
00:50:46,627 --> 00:50:49,285
Out of the way!

807
00:50:51,865 --> 00:50:54,500
(To Jecheon, Cheongnyangni)

808
00:50:54,501 --> 00:50:57,665
What an honor it is...

809
00:50:57,805 --> 00:50:59,695
for you to come all the way to see me off.

810
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:03,635
Hey.

811
00:51:04,244 --> 00:51:07,205
Why don't you tell me now?

812
00:51:07,714 --> 00:51:10,945
- About what? - That day.

813
00:51:12,186 --> 00:51:14,415
Why did you break up with me?

814
00:51:15,656 --> 00:51:18,515
I broke up with you so many times.

815
00:51:18,625 --> 00:51:20,360
About 1,000 times, maybe?

816
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:21,985
The last one.

817
00:51:22,162 --> 00:51:26,630
September 5, 2010, at 9:23am.

818
00:51:26,633 --> 00:51:28,825
You texted me, "Let's break up."

819
00:51:29,103 --> 00:51:32,165
Explain that to me, Myeong Yeo.

820
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:35,940
I didn't memorize everything...

821
00:51:35,943 --> 00:51:39,040
because I still have feelings for you. Don't get me wrong.

822
00:51:39,046 --> 00:51:42,105
I just have it memorized because I was so dumbfounded.

823
00:51:42,716 --> 00:51:45,180
No matter how many times I think about it,

824
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:47,920
I can't grasp the reason why we had to break up that day.

825
00:51:47,921 --> 00:51:50,590
I didn't do anything wrong.

826
00:51:50,591 --> 00:51:52,885
What was the reason?

827
00:51:54,595 --> 00:51:56,155
Not sure.

828
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:59,425
I can't remember a thing.

829
00:52:00,067 --> 00:52:01,730
You don't remember anything?

830
00:52:01,735 --> 00:52:05,995
Come on. Do you think I would remember that?

831
00:52:06,406 --> 00:52:09,965
It has been more than 10 years. How am I supposed to know?

832
00:52:13,113 --> 00:52:16,110
The train is approaching the station.

833
00:52:16,116 --> 00:52:20,545
Please step back and remain in the safety zone.

834
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:24,985
Bye.

835
00:52:25,125 --> 00:52:26,685
Goodbye.

836
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,790
Contact me when the first draft comes out.

837
00:52:28,795 --> 00:52:31,055
Get lost, Crybaby.

838
00:53:01,495 --> 00:53:04,225
Why don't you tell me now?

839
00:53:05,465 --> 00:53:09,225
That day. Why did you break up with me?

840
00:53:10,304 --> 00:53:14,735
September 5, 2010, at 9:23am.

841
00:53:14,775 --> 00:53:16,835
You texted me, "Let's break up."

842
00:53:18,345 --> 00:53:21,275
Explain that to me, Myeong Yeo.

843
00:53:22,416 --> 00:53:25,445
(Where are you?)

844
00:53:49,243 --> 00:53:50,740
What I'm asking is,

845
00:53:50,744 --> 00:53:52,410
was he put in jail or not?

846
00:53:52,412 --> 00:53:55,480
The arrest warrant has been rejected.

847
00:53:55,482 --> 00:53:57,180
How could I possibly put him in jail?

848
00:53:57,184 --> 00:53:58,180
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

849
00:53:58,185 --> 00:54:00,320
I'm going to put that jerk in jail by all means.

850
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,450
- Is there any evidence? - There's a ton.

851
00:54:02,456 --> 00:54:04,585
Gosh, are you sure?

852
00:54:07,094 --> 00:54:08,585
Hello.

853
00:54:13,634 --> 00:54:14,730
Let's break up.

854
00:54:14,735 --> 00:54:17,965
(Let's break up.)

855
00:54:18,705 --> 00:54:21,635
Not sure. I can't remember a thing.

856
00:54:22,276 --> 00:54:26,105
It has been more than 10 years. How am I supposed to know?

857
00:54:28,115 --> 00:54:29,580
Gosh.

858
00:54:29,583 --> 00:54:32,550
How dare you?

859
00:54:32,552 --> 00:54:34,745
How dare you look down on me?

860
00:54:35,656 --> 00:54:37,290
Who do you think you are?

861
00:54:37,291 --> 00:54:40,085
Answer me! Who do you think you are?

862
00:54:40,494 --> 00:54:43,085
Hey! You little...

863
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:44,205
(Good Night Bookstore)

864
00:57:50,784 --> 00:57:52,780
The man who was here yesterday...

865
00:57:52,786 --> 00:57:54,250
Yes?

866
00:57:54,254 --> 00:57:56,115
Is he your uncle?

867
00:57:57,824 --> 00:57:59,190
Yes.

868
00:57:59,192 --> 00:58:01,055
Hwi said...

869
00:58:02,062 --> 00:58:03,685
you're going to...

870
00:58:04,331 --> 00:58:06,825
leave here soon.

871
00:58:09,503 --> 00:58:11,095
That's not true, is it?

872
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:24,445
You're leaving too when spring comes, aren't you?

873
00:58:28,455 --> 00:58:30,745
When the weather becomes nice...

874
00:58:33,493 --> 00:58:35,985
and this place becomes warm,

875
00:58:40,166 --> 00:58:42,625
you're going back, aren't you?

876
00:58:49,476 --> 00:58:51,135
Eun Seop.

877
00:58:52,746 --> 00:58:56,775
I don't know what's going to happen to us in the future.

878
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:01,545
But...

879
00:59:03,156 --> 00:59:05,485
for the very first time,

880
00:59:05,725 --> 00:59:07,985
I'm curious what happens next.

881
00:59:15,435 --> 00:59:17,965
I'm really curious...

882
00:59:19,205 --> 00:59:20,765
what comes next.

883
00:59:24,945 --> 00:59:26,435
Eun Seop.

884
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:29,605
What about you?

885
01:00:01,214 --> 01:00:06,150
(Good Night Bookstore Private Blog Posting)

886
01:00:06,152 --> 01:00:11,320
(Good Night Bookstore held its very first public event.)

887
01:00:11,324 --> 01:00:16,390
(Irene was more or less our leader.)

888
01:00:16,396 --> 01:00:21,330
(I'm grateful to the book club members for all their hard work.)

889
01:00:21,334 --> 01:00:26,200
(In the pictures that captured their memories, )

890
01:00:26,206 --> 01:00:31,140
(they all look so happy that I almost feel jealous.)

891
01:00:31,144 --> 01:00:33,510
(Irene has become a lot more cheerful...)

892
01:00:33,513 --> 01:00:36,480
(since she came here at the end of last year.)

893
01:00:36,483 --> 01:00:39,180
(Maybe it's just me, but she seems to laugh more often, )

894
01:00:39,185 --> 01:00:41,350
(and her darkness has faded.)

895
01:00:41,354 --> 01:00:47,890
(Every time she smiles, it's a dazzling sight)

896
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:51,860
(When the Weather is Fine)

897
01:00:51,865 --> 01:00:53,530
It's the landlord's daughter.

898
01:00:53,533 --> 01:00:55,330
She says if I don't pay the rent immediately,

899
01:00:55,335 --> 01:00:57,100
I'll be kicked out.

900
01:00:57,103 --> 01:00:59,970
I hear you went on a blind date during the lunch break.

901
01:00:59,973 --> 01:01:03,070
What type of girl do you like, Jang Woo?

902
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:04,940
You signed a contract with Myeong Yeo?

903
01:01:04,944 --> 01:01:06,240
Cancel it.

904
01:01:06,246 --> 01:01:08,510
I have to publish her novel.

905
01:01:08,515 --> 01:01:10,080
There's something I need to find out.

906
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:11,880
Tell me not to leave.

907
01:01:11,885 --> 01:01:14,250
Tell me to stay with you.

908
01:01:14,254 --> 01:01:15,920
Tell me, Eun Seop.

909
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:17,615
Are we...

910
01:01:17,624 --> 01:01:19,315
in love?
