<b>No, never.</b>

3

<b>I only want a small piece of her.</b>

4

<b>It was nothing.</b>

5

<b>I'm sorry.</b>

11

<b>wanted to do something for you.</b>

19

<b>Do you know what the last thing he said to me was?</b>

20

<b>"Call me when you become miserable."</b>

21

24

<b>Doesn't it feel so warm?</b>

49
00:05:47,057 --> 00:05:48,372
<b>It's a typical Korean house.</b>

50
00:05:49,797 --> 00:05:51,471
<b>How long were you in Seoul?</b>

51
00:05:52,196 --> 00:05:53,372
<b>I wasn't.</b>

<b>- College. - From the States?</b>

<b>You wanted to see me, so I left in the middle of a lecture.</b>

00:06:15,016 --> 00:06:17,031
<b>I guess you have something important to tell me.</b>

56
00:06:17,557 --> 00:06:19,101
<b>Let's take some time to breathe before then.</b>

57
00:06:19,886 --> 00:06:21,096
<b>I'm okay now.</b>

58
00:06:21,096 --> 00:06:23,357
<b>Let's still do it. Otherwise, your mom will give me a scolding.</b>

59
00:06:23,357 --> 00:06:24,572
<b>I said I'm okay.</b>

60

<b>I know a park here. Let's go.</b>

61

<b>Your mom always said...</b>

62

<b>that you shouldn't live in Seoul...</b>

63

<b>That you should live around trees.</b>

65

<b>Tell me. What did you want to tell me?</b>

67
00:06:58,196 --> 00:06:59,642
<b>Not yet.</b>

68
00:07:00,367 --> 00:07:02,596
<b>You and I always wondered...</b>

69

<b>what Korea was like.</b>

70
00:07:05,636 --> 00:07:09,252
<b>We could only imagine it before, but we're here together now.</b>

71

<b>Let's take it slow.</b>

72
00:07:13,747 --> 00:07:14,952
<b>Do you have enough time?</b>

73
00:07:15,817 --> 00:07:16,921
<b>Yes.</b>

74
00:07:18,016 --> 00:07:20,392
<b>- Should we go to that place? - Is there a place you want to go?</b>

75
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:22,791
<b>Where you wanted to go.</b>

76
00:07:24,557 --> 00:07:25,632
<b>Me?</b>

77
00:07:29,557 --> 00:07:33,072
<b>A single leaf Lands on the shoulder</b>

78

<b>Won, look.</b>

84
00:08:22,646 --> 00:08:25,091

<b>I'm so glad I came here with you.</b>

86

<b>I think I can say it now.</b>

87
00:08:54,246 --> 00:08:55,521
<b>I'm getting married.</b>

<b>(A Piece of Your Mind)</b>

89
00:09:16,137 --> 00:09:17,811
<b>So she ran away?</b>

90
00:09:19,236 --> 00:09:21,137
<b>She didn't exactly run away.</b>

91
00:09:21,137 --> 00:09:24,277
<b>That's the same thing. I mean, was that really necessary?</b>

92
00:09:24,277 --> 00:09:26,346
<b>She changed her mind and dumped him.</b>

93
00:09:26,346 --> 00:09:28,191
<b>It's ridiculous.</b>

94
00:09:31,817 --> 00:09:33,622
<b>Did Ji Soo dump him?</b>

95
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:37,586
<b>I'll plant a lot of herbs here...</b>

96

<b>and make tea with the leaves...</b>

97

<b>- for our customers. - There's no way you'd tell me.</b>

98
00:09:46,996 --> 00:09:49,742
<b>After breaking up with Kim Ji Soo, he told me to...</b>

99
00:09:51,167 --> 00:09:52,411
<b>I was flabbergasted.</b>

100
00:09:57,336 --> 00:10:00,352
<b>My grandma was a diplomat.</b>

101
00:10:00,547 --> 00:10:02,647
<b>She felt guilty that she couldn't do anything for the Koreans...</b>

102

<b>who suffered injustice abroad.</b>

103
00:10:06,387 --> 00:10:07,862
<b>It's different now though.</b>

104
00:10:08,057 --> 00:10:10,616
<b>Anyway, Ha Won ended up alone...</b>

105
00:10:10,616 --> 00:10:13,962
<b>for a similar reason, and my grandma brought him here.</b>

106
00:10:14,496 --> 00:10:16,071
<b>That's how he became my uncle.</b>

107
00:10:16,196 --> 00:10:18,401
<b>- I told you about him before. - Yes, that he's so competent.</b>

108
00:10:20,427 --> 00:10:22,311
<b>When I first saw him...</b>

109
00:10:22,736 --> 00:10:24,411
<b>Oh, he and I are the same age.</b>

110
00:10:24,537 --> 00:10:26,407
<b>I call him as Won or Uncle.</b>

111

<b>Sometimes, that guy or hey. It all indicates him.</b>

<b>through a circuit...</b>

118
00:10:46,527 --> 00:10:48,356
<b>He was in a lecture in the States...</b>

119

<b>when he got a call from Ji Soo, and he hopped on the next flight.</b>

120

<b>He has been living in Seoul ever since.</b>

<b>Gosh, why am I crying over this?</b>

129

<b>Where did you live?</b>

<b>What does your address have to do with the research?</b>

<b>Where were you with Kim Ji Soo?</b>

<b>Gangneung.</b>

<b>When did you go to Gangneung with her?</b>

<b>We broke up there,</b>

<b>- What year was it exactly? - 2013.</b>

<b>Hey, where you lived is restricted,</b>

<b>I can get all the information...</b>

<b>if I ask indirectly relating it to Kim Ji Soo.</b>

<b>Try changing the password.</b>

00:13:27,517 --> 00:13:30,592
<b>I feel kind of bad.</b>

162
00:13:35,996 --> 00:13:37,232
<b>What?</b>

163
00:13:40,596 --> 00:13:42,041
<b>Since it's for treatment.</b>

164
00:13:42,567 --> 00:13:44,071
<b>For treatment?</b>

165
00:13:57,246 --> 00:13:58,686
<b>What do you think?</b>

166
00:13:58,687 --> 00:14:00,892
<b>I like it.</b>

167
00:14:01,356 --> 00:14:02,691
<b>Try mixing it.</b>

168
00:14:03,187 --> 00:14:04,187
<b>Pardon?</b>

169
00:14:04,187 --> 00:14:06,462
<b>Me? I'm still...</b>

170
00:14:06,757 --> 00:14:08,332
<b>You need experience to improve.</b>

171
00:14:08,757 --> 00:14:11,642
<b>You have a good ear, so I have high hopes for you.</b>

172
00:14:12,167 --> 00:14:13,742
<b>Thank you.</b>

173
00:14:16,297 --> 00:14:18,411
<b>It feels strange that all of us are here.</b>

174
00:14:18,736 --> 00:14:21,451
<b>If I join too, we'll have our original team again.</b>

175
00:14:21,677 --> 00:14:23,476
<b>What did the studio tell you?</b>

176
00:14:23,476 --> 00:14:25,147
<b>Did they make it clear yet?</b>

177
00:14:25,147 --> 00:14:26,551
<b>Not yet.</b>

178
00:14:28,946 --> 00:14:31,246
<b>We're recording a live play this week.</b>

179
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:32,321
<b>And?</b>

180
00:14:33,047 --> 00:14:34,687
<b>Come if you want to watch.</b>

181
00:14:34,687 --> 00:14:36,862
<b>The place is small but nice for capturing sounds.</b>

182
00:14:37,057 --> 00:14:38,431
<b>It'll be helpful to you.</b>

183
00:14:39,787 --> 00:14:40,962
<b>I see.</b>

184
00:14:41,826 --> 00:14:42,972
<b>(Before Dawn, They didn't meet)</b>

185
00:14:47,567 --> 00:14:49,972
<b>Is Before Dawn not coming anymore?</b>

186
00:14:58,677 --> 00:15:00,252
<b>Excuse me.</b>

187
00:15:07,187 --> 00:15:08,862
<b>Did she say she was miserable?</b>

188
00:15:09,187 --> 00:15:11,427
<b>She was miserable, but she didn't say it.</b>

189
00:15:11,427 --> 00:15:13,362
<b>That means she's miserable.</b>

190
00:15:18,267 --> 00:15:20,602
<b>I'm done meddling with their relationship now.</b>

191
00:15:23,167 --> 00:15:25,236
<b>Order a drink if you want. I don't drink.</b>

192
00:15:25,236 --> 00:15:26,811
<b>I'm okay too.</b>

193
00:15:28,976 --> 00:15:31,882
<b>I feel so bad for that guy Ha Won.</b>

194
00:15:32,346 --> 00:15:34,375
<b>I don't feel bad for him at all.</b>

195
00:15:34,376 --> 00:15:36,051
<b>He's so like me.</b>

196
00:15:37,946 --> 00:15:39,116
<b>In what way?</b>

197
00:15:39,116 --> 00:15:41,632
<b>He believes it exists when it actually doesn't.</b>

198
00:15:41,687 --> 00:15:43,862
<b>I'm great at it, you know.</b>

199
00:15:44,387 --> 00:15:47,757
<b>I always run toward it, dream about it,</b>

200
00:15:47,757 --> 00:15:49,496
<b>read too much into it,</b>

201
00:15:49,496 --> 00:15:52,397
<b>and pour my heart and soul and my time into it.</b>

202
00:15:52,397 --> 00:15:54,771
<b>But for more than 10 years, he...</b>

203
00:15:55,567 --> 00:15:57,336
<b>Who has unrequited love these days?</b>

204
00:15:57,336 --> 00:15:59,236
<b>They're competitive even about love.</b>

205
00:15:59,236 --> 00:16:00,866
<b>They argue about who loves the other more.</b>

206
00:16:00,866 --> 00:16:04,582
<b>They measure and weigh love although it's unmeasurable.</b>

207
00:16:05,876 --> 00:16:09,092
<b>But he says a small piece of her is enough.</b>

208
00:16:10,777 --> 00:16:12,517
<b>I guess he told you all sorts of things in hiding.</b>

209
00:16:12,517 --> 00:16:15,892
<b>How do you think he endured 10 years?</b>

210
00:16:16,287 --> 00:16:17,492
<b>I wonder.</b>

211
00:16:20,626 --> 00:16:22,771
<b>Wouldn't it be possible if she was precious to him?</b>

212
00:16:25,966 --> 00:16:29,712
<b>I think it would be possible if she were the center of his life.</b>

213
00:16:31,966 --> 00:16:35,082
<b>You know how a single word can let some people go on living.</b>

214
00:16:39,407 --> 00:16:41,392
<b>A single word.</b>

215
00:16:42,616 --> 00:16:46,345
<b>There is something that I think would keep me going...</b>

216
00:16:46,346 --> 00:16:49,362
<b>for about three years if someone would say it to me.</b>

217
00:16:49,757 --> 00:16:51,732
<b>Something no one ever says to me.</b>

218
00:16:54,486 --> 00:16:55,931
<b>"Stay."</b>

219
00:16:57,126 --> 00:16:59,666
<b>The real estate agent called me several times...</b>

220
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:01,497
<b>to sell the semi-basement unit.</b>

221
00:17:01,497 --> 00:17:04,572
<b>I'd sell it off right away if it weren't for you.</b>

222
00:17:05,467 --> 00:17:07,241
<b>"Seo Woo."</b>

223
00:17:08,037 --> 00:17:09,336
<b>"Stay."</b>

224
00:17:09,336 --> 00:17:10,676
<b>I'll get going.</b>

225
00:17:10,676 --> 00:17:12,552
<b>Okay, bye.</b>

226
00:17:12,676 --> 00:17:15,277
<b>- Now, the cello. - Okay.</b>

227
00:17:15,277 --> 00:17:16,852
<b>"Seo Woo."</b>

228
00:17:17,346 --> 00:17:18,792
<b>"Stay."</b>

229
00:17:30,356 --> 00:17:32,971
<b>I wonder what Ha Won's next assignment will be.</b>

230
00:17:35,396 --> 00:17:37,011
<b>I doubt there will be any.</b>

231
00:17:37,396 --> 00:17:39,711
<b>Really? Did she say that?</b>

232
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:42,411
<b>(Eatery)</b>

233
00:18:32,757 --> 00:18:34,261
<b>I hear you're miserable.</b>

234
00:18:49,914 --> 00:18:51,449
<b>I hear you're miserable.</b>

235
00:19:00,124 --> 00:19:01,929
<b>I hear you're miserable.</b>

236
00:19:03,824 --> 00:19:05,770
<b>You haven't called in years,</b>

237
00:19:06,465 --> 00:19:07,664
<b>and the first thing you say...</b>

238
00:19:07,664 --> 00:19:09,139
<b>I told you to call me.</b>

239
00:19:12,935 --> 00:19:15,149
<b>I could tell you were unhappy even from behind.</b>

240
00:19:15,235 --> 00:19:18,850
<b>Why did you run so hard? You don't even run that well.</b>

241
00:19:24,074 --> 00:19:25,689
<b>It's been a while.</b>

242
00:19:29,654 --> 00:19:31,084
<b>I'm not miserable.</b>

243
00:19:31,084 --> 00:19:32,729
<b>Then why did you run away?</b>

244
00:19:33,854 --> 00:19:35,925
<b>Because you showed up out of the blue.</b>

245
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,699
<b>Then how else was I supposed to show up?</b>

246
00:19:43,864 --> 00:19:47,010
<b>Won, I can't really talk right now.</b>

247
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:49,709
<b>- Let's talk later... - Later when?</b>

248
00:19:58,644 --> 00:20:00,620
<b>Let's talk again in 20 minutes.</b>

249
00:20:06,154 --> 00:20:07,229
<b>(Ha Won)</b>

250
00:20:44,495 --> 00:20:46,570
<b>My fiance knows you.</b>

251
00:20:46,725 --> 00:20:48,510
<b>He seems to be bothered by you.</b>

252
00:20:49,235 --> 00:20:50,909
<b>Who is he that he knows me?</b>

253
00:20:52,235 --> 00:20:56,034
<b>He has been with me ever since you left.</b>

254
00:20:56,035 --> 00:20:58,209
<b>So you knew him in Norway?</b>

255
00:20:59,304 --> 00:21:00,445
<b>Who could...</b>

256
00:21:00,445 --> 00:21:02,320
<b>Can you not try to find out?</b>

257
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:04,120
<b>Please.</b>

258
00:21:12,654 --> 00:21:14,060
<b>Do you love him?</b>

259
00:21:15,295 --> 00:21:16,600
<b>Well,</b>

260
00:21:16,955 --> 00:21:19,664
<b>I feel like I grow when I'm with him.</b>

261
00:21:19,664 --> 00:21:20,925
<b>We get each other musically...</b>

262
00:21:20,925 --> 00:21:22,040
<b>So...</b>

263
00:21:24,564 --> 00:21:26,040
<b>do you love him?</b>

264
00:21:27,935 --> 00:21:29,149
<b>Yes.</b>

265
00:21:47,455 --> 00:21:50,330
<b>Please respect my decision.</b>

266
00:21:52,925 --> 00:21:54,439
<b>Of course, I do.</b>

267
00:21:56,295 --> 00:21:57,540
<b>But...</b>

268
00:22:01,304 --> 00:22:03,010
<b>you get married.</b>

269
00:22:05,644 --> 00:22:07,919
<b>I'll keep loving you as I always have.</b>

270
00:22:11,344 --> 00:22:13,245
<b>The fact that I love you...</b>

271
00:22:13,245 --> 00:22:15,560
<b>won't affect your life in any way.</b>

272
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:19,899
<b>I'll never intrude on your life, so don't worry.</b>

273
00:22:24,324 --> 00:22:26,000
<b>Please respect my decision too.</b>

274
00:22:34,505 --> 00:22:35,909
<b>I have faith you'll be well.</b>

275
00:22:38,304 --> 00:22:39,449
<b>You have to be.</b>

276
00:22:42,175 --> 00:22:43,320
<b>But...</b>

277
00:22:45,545 --> 00:22:47,489
<b>call me when you become miserable.</b>

278
00:23:03,834 --> 00:23:08,010
<b>(Ji Soo)</b>

279
00:23:15,005 --> 00:23:17,949
<b>Sure. The voice recording, the shipping address...</b>

280
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:20,060
<b>It was all you.</b>

281
00:23:21,215 --> 00:23:22,330
<b>Why?</b>

282
00:23:23,114 --> 00:23:24,260
<b>To refresh...</b>

283
00:23:29,854 --> 00:23:31,270
<b>your recollection.</b>

284
00:23:32,364 --> 00:23:33,969
<b>To call me when you become miserable.</b>

285
00:23:35,334 --> 00:23:36,795
<b>I wanted to do it once every 10 years,</b>

286
00:23:36,795 --> 00:23:38,439
<b>and you got me from the start.</b>

287
00:23:39,535 --> 00:23:40,709
<b>You and your "being miserable".</b>

288
00:23:41,975 --> 00:23:44,709
<b>I can't say I'm perfectly happy,</b>

289
00:23:45,804 --> 00:23:47,719
<b>but I can't say I'm miserable either.</b>

290
00:23:49,715 --> 00:23:53,060
<b>I'm sufficiently miserable and sufficiently happy.</b>

291
00:23:53,485 --> 00:23:54,790
<b>You're making no sense.</b>

292
00:23:57,515 --> 00:23:58,729
<b>I'm doing well.</b>

293
00:24:02,054 --> 00:24:04,370
<b>- Ji Soo. - I won't run away next time.</b>

294
00:24:05,025 --> 00:24:06,199
<b>Okay?</b>

295
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:09,469
<b>Ji Soo.</b>

296
00:24:11,265 --> 00:24:13,110
<b>"Ji Soo."</b>

<b>It's been so long...</b>

298
00:24:28,854 --> 00:24:31,459
<b>Hey. I'm doing just fine.</b>

299
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:33,199
<b>Don't worry.</b>

300
00:24:42,295 --> 00:24:46,005
<b>I was going to ask you first before throwing it out.</b>

301
00:24:46,005 --> 00:24:47,280
<b>Why would you throw it out?</b>

302
00:24:48,035 --> 00:24:51,005
<b>Let's try leaving it out when it rains.</b>

303
00:24:51,005 --> 00:24:52,780
<b>Rain rejuvenates them at times.</b>

304
00:24:52,945 --> 00:24:55,449
<b>They grow crazy well when they get rainwater.</b>

305
00:24:55,515 --> 00:24:56,914
<b>What if someone steals it?</b>

306
00:24:56,914 --> 00:24:58,314
<b>Isn't it better if someone steals it...</b>

307
00:24:58,314 --> 00:25:00,219
<b>and saves it than it dying?</b>

308
00:25:02,354 --> 00:25:04,554
<b>- Hello. - Do you deliver?</b>

309
00:25:04,554 --> 00:25:05,699
<b>Of course.</b>

310
00:25:12,965 --> 00:25:14,699
<b>I guess he doesn't remember me.</b>

311
00:25:18,864 --> 00:25:20,209
<b>Do you want something in particular?</b>

312
00:25:21,404 --> 00:25:24,250
<b>- I'd like something small. - Look over there.</b>

313
00:25:26,675 --> 00:25:28,219
<b>Take your time.</b>

314

<b>Hello.</b>

<b>I recognized you as soon as you walked in.</b>

<b>- Don't you remember me? - Hello?</b>

320
00:26:09,914 --> 00:26:11,354
<b>Yes?</b>

321
00:26:11,354 --> 00:26:13,455
<b>Mr. Choi checked the cello sonata recording...</b>

322
00:26:13,455 --> 00:26:15,255
<b>and approved it,</b>

323
00:26:15,255 --> 00:26:17,000
<b>so I emailed you the file.</b>

324
00:26:17,795 --> 00:26:18,925
<b>I mixed it,</b>

325
00:26:18,925 --> 00:26:21,139
<b>but Mr. Choi said it was good.</b>

326
00:26:21,164 --> 00:26:23,110
<b>Would you please listen to it?</b>

327
00:26:23,965 --> 00:26:26,040
<b>It's the first I've ever mixed.</b>

328
00:26:26,134 --> 00:26:28,580
<b>- Congratulations. I'll check it. - Congratulations on what?</b>

329
00:26:33,045 --> 00:26:34,780
<b>I'll ask her once you're off the phone.</b>

330
00:26:35,574 --> 00:26:37,914
<b>Seo Woo, someone says she'll call you.</b>

331
00:26:37,914 --> 00:26:39,020
<b>Okay.</b>

332
00:26:39,545 --> 00:26:41,620
<b>Okay. Bye.</b>

333
00:26:42,584 --> 00:26:44,989
<b>You hung up already? I feel bad.</b>

334
00:26:45,824 --> 00:26:47,030
<b>Han Seo Woo. Han...</b>

335
00:26:52,195 --> 00:26:54,699
<b>Seo Woo. I hear congratulations are in order.</b>

336
00:26:55,495 --> 00:26:57,370
<b>What do you mean, how do I know?</b>

337
00:26:57,735 --> 00:26:59,610
<b>I told you. It's a small world.</b>

338
00:26:59,965 --> 00:27:02,409
<b>Will you come here if you're not busy?</b>

339
00:27:03,475 --> 00:27:04,979
<b>The address is...</b>

340
00:27:05,844 --> 00:27:08,080
<b>I wanted to clarify something.</b>

341
00:27:08,374 --> 00:27:10,850
<b>Can I keep working at the studio?</b>

342
00:27:11,475 --> 00:27:14,045
<b>Even when we don't have recordings scheduled.</b>

343
00:27:14,045 --> 00:27:15,459
<b>Most studios have someone like that.</b>

344
00:27:16,314 --> 00:27:17,459
<b>I don't know.</b>

345
00:27:18,314 --> 00:27:19,755
<b>Please tell me,</b>

346
00:27:19,755 --> 00:27:22,600
<b>so that I know whether or not to let the studio grow on me.</b>

347
00:27:26,164 --> 00:27:27,725
<b>I guess everything is personal to you.</b>

348
00:27:27,725 --> 00:27:32,040
<b>Of course. Every single thing, every corner, is mine when I work.</b>

349
00:27:32,864 --> 00:27:35,409
<b>Okay. Then it makes sense that you want to know.</b>

350
00:27:35,804 --> 00:27:36,949
<b>Give me a minute.</b>

351
00:27:50,114 --> 00:27:51,189
<b>Hey.</b>

352
00:27:54,755 --> 00:27:56,030
<b>Tell her to stay.</b>

353
00:27:56,554 --> 00:27:57,629
<b>Okay.</b>

354
00:27:59,225 --> 00:28:00,370
<b>Stay.</b>

355
00:28:01,094 --> 00:28:02,169
<b>Excuse me?</b>

356
00:28:02,965 --> 00:28:04,209
<b>He says to stay.</b>

357
00:28:05,035 --> 00:28:07,010
<b>Keep staying at the studio.</b>

358
00:28:10,404 --> 00:28:12,679
<b>Is that Ha Won too?</b>

359
00:28:12,844 --> 00:28:15,550
<b>Your entire world is filled with Ha Won, isn't it?</b>

360
00:28:16,745 --> 00:28:19,120
<b>I was important to him.</b>

361
00:28:20,384 --> 00:28:24,189
<b>No one can be important to him on a personal level.</b>

362
00:28:25,525 --> 00:28:26,629
<b>Let's go.</b>

363
00:28:41,705 --> 00:28:45,379
<b>(Ji Soo)</b>

364
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:57,560
<b>Hey.</b>

365
00:28:58,354 --> 00:29:00,530
<b>I was doing the laundry, so I couldn't pick up.</b>

366
00:29:01,054 --> 00:29:02,129
<b>What's up?</b>

367
00:29:02,525 --> 00:29:04,629
<b>Ji Soo even does laundry now?</b>

368
00:29:06,864 --> 00:29:09,169
<b>I'm so speechless, I can't help but laugh.</b>

369
00:29:10,995 --> 00:29:12,540
<b>You called for no reason, didn't you?</b>

370
00:29:14,904 --> 00:29:15,979
<b>That's right.</b>

371
00:29:42,765 --> 00:29:43,870
<b>You came.</b>

372
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:54,871


373
00:30:01,745 --> 00:30:03,260
<b>(Ji Soo)</b>

374
00:30:07,084 --> 00:30:09,229
<b>(Sindongmun)</b>

375
00:30:17,035 --> 00:30:18,840
<b>You sent me a new message?</b>

376
00:30:20,505 --> 00:30:21,580
<b>It suddenly...</b>

377
00:30:23,475 --> 00:30:25,449
<b>got dark and started to rain, right?</b>

378
00:30:27,104 --> 00:30:29,719
<b>- Yes. - That's my message too.</b>

379
00:30:31,175 --> 00:30:32,820
<b>The sun rising, and setting,</b>

380
00:30:34,384 --> 00:30:37,790
<b>the wind blowing, and it raining. All of it.</b>

381
00:30:39,154 --> 00:30:42,399
<b>Everything you saw, heard, and gazed upon... Everything.</b>

382
00:30:43,795 --> 00:30:46,840
<b>It's my message to be happy wherever you are.</b>

383
00:31:07,844 --> 00:31:09,229
<b>It's from Kang In Wook.</b>

384
00:31:40,545 --> 00:31:42,755
<b>Is today the only day we can record it here?</b>

385
00:31:42,755 --> 00:31:44,729
<b>- Yes. Probably. - How much time do we have?</b>

386
00:31:45,114 --> 00:31:47,459
<b>One hour. It's hard to rent this place.</b>

387
00:31:51,195 --> 00:31:52,500
<b>Record that for me now.</b>

388
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,770
<b>Seo Woo!</b>

389
00:31:56,834 --> 00:31:59,879
<b>Seo Woo. Can you find just the piano?</b>

390
00:32:01,834 --> 00:32:02,949
<b>Yes.</b>

391
00:32:03,604 --> 00:32:04,679
<b>Look for me.</b>

392
00:32:07,374 --> 00:32:09,620
<b>Was that not a person's voice?</b>

393
00:32:43,215 --> 00:32:44,449
<b>Stay here.</b>

394
00:32:45,414 --> 00:32:46,790
<b>In Wook.</b>

395
00:32:53,185 --> 00:32:56,830
<b>If I could apologize...</b>

396
00:32:59,995 --> 00:33:01,300
<b>To whom?</b>

397
00:33:03,994 --> 00:33:05,509
<b>Are you going to Oslo?</b>

398
00:33:05,865 --> 00:33:07,139
<b>Should I?</b>

399
00:33:14,104 --> 00:33:16,420
<b>If you're going to apologize to just scenery, do it here.</b>

400
00:33:20,414 --> 00:33:21,960
<b>What if...</b>

401
00:33:25,115 --> 00:33:27,330
<b>I could apologize to Won?</b>

402
00:33:31,155 --> 00:33:32,870
<b>You don't keep in touch with him.</b>

403
00:33:34,795 --> 00:33:36,635
<b>I know his email address.</b>

404
00:33:36,635 --> 00:33:38,909
<b>- I can call... - It's nothing to apologize for.</b>

405
00:33:40,305 --> 00:33:43,449
<b>How many times must I tell you that it makes me miserable...</b>

406
00:33:43,505 --> 00:33:45,650
<b>and that it's too hard for me?</b>

407
00:33:47,144 --> 00:33:51,275
<b>Ji Soo. This isn't a problem as long as you're okay with it.</b>

408
00:33:51,275 --> 00:33:53,190
<b>It's not worth making us...</b>

409
00:33:56,885 --> 00:33:58,259
<b>like this.</b>

410
00:34:00,485 --> 00:34:02,299
<b>It's your problem now.</b>

411
00:35:16,264 --> 00:35:17,870
<b>I saw you come in.</b>

412
00:35:18,295 --> 00:35:19,880
<b>Do you know this place?</b>

413
00:35:20,204 --> 00:35:22,909
<b>This is my favorite cafe. Isn't it nice?</b>

414
00:35:23,305 --> 00:35:24,980
<b>You looked like you were watching someone.</b>

415
00:35:25,974 --> 00:35:27,580
<b>I was people-watching.</b>

416
00:35:27,744 --> 00:35:28,845
<b>I like doing that.</b>

417
00:35:28,845 --> 00:35:30,089
<b>Alone?</b>

418
00:35:30,974 --> 00:35:33,190
<b>Maybe someone will come.</b>

419
00:35:33,845 --> 00:35:35,514
<b>I'm so clueless.</b>

420
00:35:35,514 --> 00:35:37,359
<b>I'll go to another table.</b>

421
00:35:38,255 --> 00:35:40,425
<b>Actually, I have happy news.</b>

422
00:35:40,425 --> 00:35:42,699
<b>The studio said to keep coming.</b>

423
00:35:43,354 --> 00:35:46,799
<b>Congratulations. I won't be going there anymore.</b>

424
00:35:48,224 --> 00:35:49,739
<b>Did you finish?</b>

425
00:35:52,365 --> 00:35:54,839
<b>From now on, I'm going to enjoy coffee and music in the mornings,</b>

426
00:35:55,905 --> 00:35:57,310
<b>rather than cleaning.</b>

427
00:36:00,244 --> 00:36:01,650
<b>As you should.</b>

428
00:36:04,675 --> 00:36:06,120
<b>You see over there?</b>

429
00:36:06,514 --> 00:36:09,389
<b>That's where Ha Won missed Ji Soo.</b>

430
00:36:09,414 --> 00:36:11,529
<b>And I almost found Ha Won.</b>

431
00:36:15,385 --> 00:36:18,830
<b>Is there something you want to ask that person Ha Won?</b>

432
00:36:21,325 --> 00:36:22,710
<b>No.</b>

433
00:36:23,334 --> 00:36:25,639
<b>I just want to see him from afar.</b>

434
00:36:26,905 --> 00:36:28,210
<b>From afar?</b>

435
00:36:29,334 --> 00:36:31,650
<b>I want to see his face from afar.</b>

436
00:36:32,675 --> 00:36:33,874
<b>Why from afar?</b>

437
00:36:33,874 --> 00:36:37,389
<b>If I'm too close, he'll see that I pity him.</b>

438
00:36:39,784 --> 00:36:41,290
<b>He'll see that look on my face.</b>

439
00:36:42,485 --> 00:36:44,985
<b>I want to see what he looks like from afar.</b>

440
00:36:44,985 --> 00:36:47,425
<b>"So that's what someone who does something like that looks like."</b>

441
00:36:47,425 --> 00:36:50,699
<b>I'll just look at his face. I wouldn't ask him anything.</b>

442
00:36:51,425 --> 00:36:54,440
<b>I hope you work a very long time at the place that asked you to stay.</b>

443
00:36:58,534 --> 00:36:59,609
<b>Thank you.</b>

444
00:37:04,374 --> 00:37:05,805
<b>Work here.</b>

445
00:37:05,805 --> 00:37:07,949
<b>You said you were waiting for someone.</b>

446
00:37:08,675 --> 00:37:09,775
<b>I don't think the person is coming.</b>

447
00:37:09,775 --> 00:37:11,989
<b>I'm sure they will. I'll...</b>

448
00:37:13,885 --> 00:37:16,889
<b>There are plenty of other places nearby where I can work.</b>

449
00:37:34,764 --> 00:37:37,609
<b>Why am I sad to hear I won't see him again?</b>

450
00:37:59,365 --> 00:38:00,699
<b>Won,</b>

451
00:38:01,994 --> 00:38:03,909
<b>do you want to go to Norway?</b>

452
00:38:12,374 --> 00:38:13,505
<b>When?</b>

453
00:38:13,505 --> 00:38:15,420
<b>Tomorrow is good too.</b>

454
00:38:17,514 --> 00:38:18,719
<b>Why?</b>

455
00:38:19,314 --> 00:38:21,460
<b>I need your help.</b>

456
00:38:22,684 --> 00:38:25,060
<b>There's something I need you to do there.</b>

457
00:38:28,485 --> 00:38:29,699
<b>What is it?</b>

458
00:38:31,894 --> 00:38:34,264
<b>You just have to say one thing.</b>

459
00:38:34,264 --> 00:38:35,799
<b>What's that?</b>

460
00:38:36,595 --> 00:38:38,109
<b>I'll say it now.</b>

461
00:38:40,604 --> 00:38:42,135
<b>Well...</b>

462
00:38:42,135 --> 00:38:44,310
<b>It's okay. Tell me.</b>

463
00:38:45,204 --> 00:38:47,020
<b>Tell me, and I'll help you.</b>

464
00:38:47,945 --> 00:38:50,920
<b>I shouldn't have said anything. Sorry.</b>

465
00:38:51,374 --> 00:38:53,719
<b>- I'll call you again... - Let's go tomorrow.</b>

466
00:38:56,155 --> 00:38:57,989
<b>I'll help you, and then you can tell me.</b>

467
00:39:00,784 --> 00:39:03,354
<b>Okay. Let's meet at the cafe.</b>

468
00:39:03,354 --> 00:39:04,630
<b>I know.</b>

469
00:39:05,354 --> 00:39:06,799
<b>Where you ran away.</b>

470
00:39:09,494 --> 00:39:11,839
<b>See you there tomorrow morning...</b>

471
00:39:15,534 --> 00:39:17,509
<b>It's nothing to apologize for.</b>

472
00:39:17,775 --> 00:39:20,850
<b>How many times must I tell you that it makes me miserable...</b>

473
00:39:20,874 --> 00:39:23,219
<b>and that it's too hard for me?</b>

474
00:39:24,474 --> 00:39:26,344
<b>Never mind. No.</b>

475
00:39:26,345 --> 00:39:29,784
<b>I'll call you tonight after I think it over some more.</b>

476
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:31,690
<b>What are you thinking about?</b>

477
00:39:34,224 --> 00:39:35,954
<b>It may be too hard for you...</b>

478
00:39:35,954 --> 00:39:37,170
<b>See you tomorrow.</b>

479
00:40:28,275 --> 00:40:29,790
<b>Are you here for the cafe?</b>

480
00:40:31,115 --> 00:40:32,350
<b>Yes.</b>

481
00:40:32,474 --> 00:40:34,290
<b>Would you like to wait inside?</b>

482
00:40:35,485 --> 00:40:36,759
<b>Thank you.</b>

483
00:41:50,155 --> 00:41:51,529
<b>Leave.</b>

484
00:41:52,965 --> 00:41:56,609
<b>I'll stay behind and find out why.</b>

485
00:42:36,434 --> 00:42:39,080
<b>I'm sorry again about the other day.</b>

486
00:42:39,235 --> 00:42:41,005
<b>Please call or text me when you have time.</b>

487
00:42:41,005 --> 00:42:43,514
<b>(I'm sorry again about the other day.)</b>

488
00:42:43,514 --> 00:42:44,545
<b>(I'm nearby.)</b>

489
00:42:44,545 --> 00:42:45,719
<b>I'm nearby.</b>

490
00:42:56,184 --> 00:42:57,299
<b>Over here.</b>

491
00:43:02,994 --> 00:43:05,069
<b>It can be a gift or a nuisance.</b>

492
00:43:05,834 --> 00:43:08,080
<b>- What is it? - A plant.</b>

493
00:43:08,564 --> 00:43:10,279
<b>Keep it if you can grow it.</b>

494
00:43:10,434 --> 00:43:13,350
<b>If not, just water it a little for a few days.</b>

495
00:43:13,505 --> 00:43:14,880
<b>It's quite finicky.</b>

496
00:43:15,144 --> 00:43:16,850
<b>I'm super good with plants.</b>

497
00:43:17,675 --> 00:43:19,620
<b>Then it's a gift. It's all yours.</b>

498
00:43:20,584 --> 00:43:22,389
<b>What were you doing nearby?</b>

499
00:43:24,985 --> 00:43:26,759
<b>I had something to decide.</b>

500
00:43:27,854 --> 00:43:29,259
<b>I'm going to go alone.</b>

501
00:43:29,724 --> 00:43:32,429
<b>I'm scared, but I'm going to go.</b>

502
00:43:35,025 --> 00:43:38,069
<b>It concerns me that you're scared.</b>

503
00:43:41,235 --> 00:43:42,679
<b>I'll be fine.</b>

504
00:43:43,405 --> 00:43:46,279
<b>I gained courage the moment I told you.</b>

505
00:43:49,845 --> 00:43:51,049
<b>Tell me more.</b>

506
00:43:51,474 --> 00:43:53,920
<b>I'll listen to everything you want to say.</b>

507
00:43:55,084 --> 00:43:57,429
<b>I received a gift and everything. Say anything you want.</b>

508
00:43:58,055 --> 00:44:00,199
<b>It's okay if it's about things that upset you.</b>

509
00:44:18,005 --> 00:44:19,080
<b>Before...</b>

510
00:44:19,704 --> 00:44:21,480
<b>I met my husband,</b>

511
00:44:22,604 --> 00:44:24,750
<b>he did something...</b>

512
00:44:25,874 --> 00:44:27,859
<b>He made a mistake.</b>

513
00:44:30,655 --> 00:44:32,630
<b>Now that I found out about it,</b>

514
00:44:33,954 --> 00:44:35,500
<b>it's too hard for me to bear.</b>

515
00:44:37,825 --> 00:44:40,969
<b>My whole world turned upside down in an instant.</b>

516
00:44:43,795 --> 00:44:45,239
<b>This...</b>

517
00:44:46,564 --> 00:44:48,239
<b>This pain...</b>

518
00:44:50,505 --> 00:44:51,949
<b>is all new to me.</b>

519
00:44:55,104 --> 00:44:56,219
<b>This...</b>

520
00:44:57,575 --> 00:44:58,690
<b>is too...</b>

521
00:45:03,414 --> 00:45:04,889
<b>You didn't go to the mountain, did you?</b>

522
00:45:05,055 --> 00:45:07,029
<b>I said to go somewhere high up.</b>

523
00:45:07,325 --> 00:45:09,500
<b>It's therapeutic to look down on the world.</b>

524
00:45:10,224 --> 00:45:12,670
<b>You can scream as loudly as you can.</b>

525
00:45:14,695 --> 00:45:16,639
<b>Do you want to scream in there?</b>

526
00:45:16,994 --> 00:45:19,810
<b>It's soundproofed, so it's the best at relieving stress.</b>

527
00:45:25,575 --> 00:45:28,480
<b>There's something particular that you want to hear,</b>

528
00:45:30,115 --> 00:45:32,389
<b>and not these silly things, right?</b>

529
00:45:34,644 --> 00:45:37,130
<b>That one thing that you feel would make it all go away.</b>

530
00:45:41,755 --> 00:45:42,960
<b>"It's okay."</b>

531
00:45:47,064 --> 00:45:48,739
<b>"It's nothing."</b>

532
00:46:05,845 --> 00:46:08,089
<b>Everyone makes mistakes.</b>

533
00:46:10,314 --> 00:46:12,130
<b>Even nature makes mistakes.</b>

534
00:46:15,655 --> 00:46:17,130
<b>My parents...</b>

535
00:46:18,224 --> 00:46:21,000
<b>died in a forest fire.</b>

536
00:46:23,664 --> 00:46:25,509
<b>I don't usually tell people this.</b>

537
00:46:32,005 --> 00:46:33,750
<b>Even nature makes mistakes.</b>

538
00:46:35,275 --> 00:46:37,719
<b>It's okay. It's nothing.</b>

539
00:46:50,155 --> 00:46:51,299
<b>Just a minute.</b>

540
00:47:21,624 --> 00:47:24,029
<b>(Dear Before Dawn. Please clean before you leave.)</b>

541
00:47:25,555 --> 00:47:27,870
<b>(Dear Before Dawn. Please clean before you leave.)</b>

542
00:47:31,795 --> 00:47:33,739
<b>"Nightlike afternoon."</b>

543
00:47:35,834 --> 00:47:38,080
<b>Even objects fall flat on their faces.</b>

544
00:47:38,175 --> 00:47:40,520
<b>It's just me and the machines. How strange is that?</b>

545
00:47:41,204 --> 00:47:43,549
<b>What is this?</b>

546
00:47:45,215 --> 00:47:46,319
<b>This?</b>

547
00:47:49,084 --> 00:47:51,389
<b>I think Before Dawn wrote this.</b>

548
00:47:52,914 --> 00:47:54,960
<b>I wonder what he does for a living.</b>

549
00:47:55,284 --> 00:47:56,799
<b>This is a flowchart.</b>

550
00:47:57,695 --> 00:47:58,830
<b>Dawn?</b>

551
00:47:59,055 --> 00:48:00,664
<b>I call him "Before Dawn"...</b>

552
00:48:00,664 --> 00:48:02,969
<b>because he rents this space for four hours early in the morning.</b>

553
00:48:04,135 --> 00:48:05,994
<b>You know, I ran into him yesterday...</b>

554
00:48:05,994 --> 00:48:07,440
<b>at the cafe we go to all the time.</b>

555
00:48:08,005 --> 00:48:09,440
<b>He said he won't be coming anymore.</b>

556
00:48:12,505 --> 00:48:14,750
<b>He asked out of the blue if I was miserable,</b>

557
00:48:15,075 --> 00:48:16,380
<b>so I wondered why.</b>

558
00:48:17,845 --> 00:48:19,190
<b>So this is how he knew.</b>

559
00:48:22,945 --> 00:48:25,759
<b>You said you never saw Ha Won, right?</b>

560
00:48:25,914 --> 00:48:28,759
<b>Yes. I saw him from behind from far away. That's all.</b>

561
00:48:31,454 --> 00:48:32,870
<b>I think you will see him.</b>

562
00:48:33,264 --> 00:48:34,940
<b>You may have already.</b>

563
00:48:36,865 --> 00:48:37,969
<b>What?</b>

564
00:48:39,564 --> 00:48:40,679
<b>I'm glad.</b>

565
00:51:20,325 --> 00:51:21,569
<b>Is something wrong?</b>

566
00:51:22,994 --> 00:51:24,670
<b>I can't concentrate.</b>

567
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:29,480
<b>I can't reschedule anymore.</b>

568
00:51:32,974 --> 00:51:35,779
<b>One more song and we're done.</b>

569
00:51:41,584 --> 00:51:42,920
<b>Why did you go?</b>

570
00:51:47,124 --> 00:51:48,529
<b>Why?</b>

571
00:51:59,865 --> 00:52:02,339
<b>- Please take your time. - Thank you.</b>

572
00:52:49,144 --> 00:52:51,389
<b>This isn't good.</b>

573
00:54:01,155 --> 00:54:04,730
<b>Nice. That was good.</b>

574
00:56:19,555 --> 00:56:21,239
<b>I guess she isn't coming today either.</b>

575
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:23,325
<b>She'll come eventually.</b>

576
00:56:23,325 --> 00:56:26,195
<b>Once she does, I'll testify as to how much you waited.</b>

577
00:56:26,195 --> 00:56:27,805
<b>Make sure to collect for it all.</b>

578
00:56:27,805 --> 00:56:29,505
<b>You have to. You promised.</b>

579
00:56:29,505 --> 00:56:30,679
<b>I will.</b>

580
00:56:32,204 --> 00:56:35,750
<b>The moon is huge tonight. It looks like it's coming toward us.</b>

581
00:56:40,715 --> 00:56:42,290
<b>Make a wish.</b>

582
00:56:43,314 --> 00:56:44,589
<b>She'll come.</b>

583
00:57:01,465 --> 00:57:02,810
<b>Hello?</b>

584
00:57:02,905 --> 00:57:04,609
<b>It's...</b>

585
00:57:05,005 --> 00:57:06,679
<b>blinding here.</b>

586
00:57:06,874 --> 00:57:08,779
<b>It's so nice.</b>

587
00:57:11,045 --> 00:57:14,319
<b>Now that I'm here, I wonder why I lived like that.</b>

588
00:57:14,985 --> 00:57:16,584
<b>All my anxiety lifted.</b>

589
00:57:16,584 --> 00:57:18,029
<b>Where are you?</b>

590
00:57:18,684 --> 00:57:21,429
<b>I'm on the path I used to walk all the time with Won.</b>

591
00:57:21,885 --> 00:57:23,460
<b>In Norway?</b>

592
00:57:26,724 --> 00:57:29,194
<b>How did I forget this place?</b>

593
00:57:29,195 --> 00:57:31,564
<b>Did you always have such a cheerful voice?</b>

594
00:57:31,564 --> 00:57:33,540
<b>Your voice sounds completely different.</b>

595
00:57:34,104 --> 00:57:35,905
<b>I'm glad you went.</b>

596
00:57:35,905 --> 00:57:38,103
<b>I can handle it all.</b>

597
00:57:38,104 --> 00:57:40,179
<b>I'm a tough girl.</b>

598
00:57:40,575 --> 00:57:42,880
<b>I'm so glad I came alone.</b>

599
00:57:44,974 --> 00:57:46,775
<b>Seo Woo.</b>

600
00:57:46,775 --> 00:57:50,989
<b>Would you please tell Won not to wait at the cafe?</b>

601
00:57:51,314 --> 00:57:53,154
<b>I just came.</b>

602
00:57:53,155 --> 00:57:57,195
<b>He's very simpleminded, so I feel like he'll keep waiting.</b>

603
00:57:57,195 --> 00:57:59,525
<b>I told you, I don't know who he is.</b>

604
00:57:59,525 --> 00:58:01,270
<b>It's so easy.</b>

605
00:58:01,894 --> 00:58:03,095
<b>It's a quiz.</b>

606
00:58:03,095 --> 00:58:05,870
<b>I'll call you in a bit. Solve the quiz, okay?</b>

607
00:58:07,334 --> 00:58:08,580
<b>I'll give you a hint.</b>

608
00:58:08,905 --> 00:58:10,980
<b>You've already met him.</b>

609
00:58:13,675 --> 00:58:15,719
<b>I'll call you later.</b>

610
00:58:16,144 --> 00:58:17,250
<b>But...</b>

611
00:58:19,244 --> 00:58:21,120
<b>Who's Ha Won?</b>

612
00:58:26,514 --> 00:58:28,560
<b>Wouldn't it be possible if she was precious to him?</b>

613
00:58:29,525 --> 00:58:33,270
<b>I think it would be possible if she were the center of his life.</b>

614
00:58:34,295 --> 00:58:35,839
<b>No way.</b>

615
00:58:39,894 --> 00:58:43,239
<b>I became miserable, but I didn't call him.</b>

616
00:58:43,334 --> 00:58:45,150
<b>Did she say she was miserable?</b>

617
00:58:50,045 --> 00:58:51,144
<b>"Stay."</b>

618
00:58:51,144 --> 00:58:54,485
<b>He says to stay. Keep staying at the studio.</b>

619
00:58:54,485 --> 00:58:57,489
<b>I hope you work a very long time at the place that asked you to stay.</b>

620
00:58:59,385 --> 00:59:01,500
<b>Was that you too?</b>

621
00:59:03,184 --> 00:59:05,600
<b>Ms. Moon.</b>

622
00:59:52,288 --> 00:59:55,202
<b>I told you, I quit the piano a long time ago.</b>

623
00:59:55,527 --> 00:59:58,928
<b>You were the only one who didn't know that your favorite pupil...</b>

624
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:00,642
<b>just didn't have the skills.</b>

625
01:00:03,728 --> 01:00:06,598
<b>Won lives in Seoul, but his skin is fine.</b>

626
01:00:06,598 --> 01:00:08,443
<b>He's very healthy.</b>

627
01:00:33,328 --> 01:00:35,573
<b>Won's mother, whom I love...</b>

628
01:00:36,428 --> 01:00:38,742
<b>and miss so very much.</b>

629
01:00:41,107 --> 01:00:42,782
<b>May I...</b>

630
01:00:45,808 --> 01:00:47,952
<b>apologize on his behalf?</b>

631
01:02:46,357 --> 01:02:48,073
<b>(Kim Ji Soo)</b>

632
01:02:50,768 --> 01:02:53,573
<b>Is he really Before Dawn? Is Ha Won Before Dawn?</b>

633
01:02:57,437 --> 01:02:58,512
<b>Hello?</b>

634
01:02:59,337 --> 01:03:00,483
