161
00:13:41,108 --> 00:13:43,394
<b>He jumped off on his own.</b>

162
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,132
<b>He jumped off on his own.</b>

163
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,236
<b>Do you think Eun Ho rappelled down?</b>

164
00:13:52,303 --> 00:13:54,772
<b>When I first heard
that he fell from here,</b>

165
00:13:56,032 --> 00:13:57,934
<b>I thought it was a miracle...</b>

166
00:13:58,549 --> 00:14:00,244
<b>that he was still alive.</b>

167
00:14:00,822 --> 00:14:02,546
<b>But if you fall from this height,</b>

168
00:14:02,746 --> 00:14:05,115
<b>it's like a car crashing head-on
into a cement wall...</b>

169
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,618
<b>at 95 km per hour...</b>

170
00:14:07,907 --> 00:14:10,087
<b>without a seat belt or an airbag!</b>

171
00:14:11,388 --> 00:14:14,391
<b>But since it was that high,</b>

172
00:14:23,716 --> 00:14:26,570
<b>he must've thought
he had a chance of surviving,</b>

173
00:14:27,369 --> 00:14:28,606
<b>so he untied his belt.</b>

174
00:14:29,106 --> 00:14:30,541
<b>But even at that height...</b>

175
00:14:30,641 --> 00:14:31,675
<b>Mr. Lee.</b>

176
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:34,978
<b>- Yes.
- If he rappelled down,</b>

177
00:14:35,002 --> 00:14:36,647
<b>it couldn't have been
this life line.</b>

178
00:14:37,281 --> 00:14:39,881
<b>Why would there be a life line
that's far shorter than the height?</b>

179
00:14:40,584 --> 00:14:41,652
<b>Right.</b>

180
00:14:42,074 --> 00:14:43,153
<b>You're right.</b>

181
00:14:43,602 --> 00:14:46,005
<b>Even if the rope was cut,</b>

182
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:48,411
<b>this rope must've been tied here...</b>

183
00:14:48,435 --> 00:14:51,795
<b>when the employees of the hotel
found him, right?</b>

184
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,798
<b>It must've been impossible
to unfasten the safety rope...</b>

185
00:14:53,822 --> 00:14:56,658
<b>without leaving a trace after
he fell and before he was found.</b>

186
00:14:57,657 --> 00:15:00,097
<b>That means he didn't fall
because the life line was defective.</b>

187
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,972
<b>I'm sure
the culprit didn't expect...</b>

188
00:15:01,998 --> 00:15:05,743
<b>Eun Ho would
use the life line to go down.</b>

189
00:15:05,772 --> 00:15:08,055
<b>There's no reason for them to place
a life line that's too short...</b>

190
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,613
<b>for this building
in the first place.</b>

191
00:15:23,945 --> 00:15:25,829
<b>It was replaced after the incident.</b>

192
00:15:26,196 --> 00:15:29,733
<b>To destroy evidence,
the culprit replaced the life line.</b>

193
00:15:30,534 --> 00:15:33,837
<b>But he made a mistake of replacing
it with a shorter one.</b>

194
00:15:35,136 --> 00:15:36,540
<b>Then do you think...</b>

195
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:38,809
<b>there's another criminal...</b>

196
00:15:39,201 --> 00:15:41,211
<b>among the insiders of the hotel?</b>

197
00:15:42,846 --> 00:15:44,915
<b>If the criminal was working
in the hotel,</b>

198
00:15:45,457 --> 00:15:48,162
<b>that explains why he had to bring
him from the abandoned building...</b>

199
00:15:48,186 --> 00:15:49,720
<b>to the hotel.</b>

200
00:15:50,354 --> 00:15:51,422
<b>That's why it's strange.</b>

201
00:15:52,615 --> 00:15:54,592
<b>Why would he commit a crime...</b>

202
00:15:55,142 --> 00:15:56,410
<b>at his workplace?</b>

203
00:15:57,689 --> 00:15:59,330
<b>And this is a hotel.</b>

204
00:16:03,167 --> 00:16:04,201
<b>Ms. Cha.</b>

205
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:08,205
<b>If you're hiding something from me,</b>

206
00:16:08,668 --> 00:16:10,341
<b>please be honest and tell me.</b>

207
00:16:10,474 --> 00:16:11,575
<b>There's more, isn't there?</b>

208
00:16:13,811 --> 00:16:14,922
<b>This case didn't begin...</b>

209
00:16:14,946 --> 00:16:17,281
<b>because of the 30,000 dollars
that Eun Ho acquired.</b>

210
00:16:18,148 --> 00:16:20,250
<b>It happened because he saved Ki Ho.</b>

211
00:16:21,212 --> 00:16:23,320
<b>I checked the security cameras
in the emergency room.</b>

212
00:16:23,387 --> 00:16:26,290
<b>Ki Ho handed something to Eun Ho.</b>

213
00:16:26,936 --> 00:16:28,726
<b>And he put it in his bag.</b>

214
00:16:28,926 --> 00:16:32,073
<b>After that,
his bag went missing, he fell,</b>

215
00:16:32,097 --> 00:16:34,365
<b>and his bag reappeared.</b>

216
00:16:34,409 --> 00:16:36,276
<b>The person who stole Eun Ho's bag...</b>

217
00:16:36,301 --> 00:16:38,068
<b>to get what Ki Ho gave him.</b>

218
00:16:39,336 --> 00:16:40,738
<b>That's the criminal.</b>

219
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:42,239
<b>The criminal wasn't...</b>

220
00:16:43,061 --> 00:16:45,275
<b>trying to harm Eun Ho.</b>

221
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:47,210
<b>Then...</b>

222
00:16:47,294 --> 00:16:49,390
<b>he moved from the abandoned building
to the hotel because...</b>

223
00:16:49,414 --> 00:16:51,548
<b>He saved Eun Ho from Dae Hoon.</b>

224
00:16:53,484 --> 00:16:56,320
<b>Because Eun Ho had
what Ki Ho gave him,</b>

225
00:16:57,294 --> 00:16:59,156
<b>and he was valuable.</b>

226
00:17:00,724 --> 00:17:01,758
<b>But...</b>

227
00:17:01,869 --> 00:17:04,194
<b>there weren't any particular wounds
on Dae Hoon's body.</b>

228
00:17:04,261 --> 00:17:07,464
<b>Eun Ho and Dae Hoon both followed
without resisting.</b>

229
00:17:09,033 --> 00:17:10,768
<b>That means they know the person.</b>

230
00:17:11,669 --> 00:17:12,936
<b>Who was it...</b>

231
00:17:14,905 --> 00:17:16,872
<b>that Eun Ho willingly followed?</b>

232
00:17:17,664 --> 00:17:20,620
<b>His friend told him to meet
at an abandoned building,</b>

233
00:17:20,645 --> 00:17:22,123
<b>and he went there
just as he was told...</b>

234
00:17:22,147 --> 00:17:23,681
<b>although he was anxious.</b>

235
00:17:24,025 --> 00:17:26,383
<b>He must have trusted his friend.</b>

236
00:17:26,542 --> 00:17:28,452
<b>But you're betrayed
only when you trust someone.</b>

237
00:17:29,547 --> 00:17:31,165
<b>If I were 15 years old like him...</b>

238
00:17:31,189 --> 00:17:33,057
<b>You shouldn't have done anything
there.</b>

239
00:17:35,626 --> 00:17:37,494
<b>Should I have stopped
in that situation?</b>

240
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:47,704
<b>Hey.</b>

241
00:17:47,884 --> 00:17:49,506
<b>How dare you threaten my Min Sung?</b>

242
00:17:59,029 --> 00:18:00,063
<b>Yes.</b>

243
00:18:08,915 --> 00:18:10,527
<b>Get up.</b>

244
00:18:10,828 --> 00:18:11,829
<b>You know what?</b>

245
00:18:11,892 --> 00:18:16,200
<b>I'll teach you what real friends
do for each other today.</b>

246
00:18:19,906 --> 00:18:21,004
<b>Say it.</b>

247
00:18:21,338 --> 00:18:22,778
<b>Say that you'll keep
your mouth shut.</b>

248
00:18:25,255 --> 00:18:26,610
<b>Stop it.</b>

249
00:18:26,954 --> 00:18:29,079
<b>So say it now.</b>

250
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:31,949
<b>Please don't kill me.</b>

251
00:18:33,042 --> 00:18:35,052
<b>You're supposed to press harder!</b>

252
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:51,535
<b>Children grow...</b>

253
00:18:53,895 --> 00:18:56,140
<b>even if you force them down.</b>

254
00:18:58,784 --> 00:19:00,377
<b>You don't understand, do you?</b>

255
00:19:01,812 --> 00:19:02,813
<b>Darn it.</b>

256
00:19:03,426 --> 00:19:04,481
<b>Come here.</b>

257
00:19:06,008 --> 00:19:07,084
<b>Come on.</b>

258
00:19:14,191 --> 00:19:15,526
<b>Children become...</b>

259
00:19:16,076 --> 00:19:20,264
<b>adults in the end
as long as they're alive.</b>

260
00:19:27,571 --> 00:19:28,572
<b>You're...</b>

261
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,452
<b>the guy at the school gate
last morning, right?</b>

262
00:19:31,476 --> 00:19:32,810
<b>I am.</b>

263
00:19:33,143 --> 00:19:34,211
<b>His name is...</b>

264
00:19:35,846 --> 00:19:39,283
<b>Ha Min Sung,</b>

265
00:19:39,883 --> 00:19:40,884
<b>right?</b>

266
00:19:42,902 --> 00:19:45,789
<b>I can explain this.</b>

267
00:19:51,384 --> 00:19:52,384
<b>Hey.</b>

268
00:19:53,397 --> 00:19:54,406
<b>Are you okay?</b>

269
00:19:54,431 --> 00:19:55,711
<b>Should I take you to a hospital?</b>

270
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,401
<b>I don't think it's that bad.</b>

271
00:19:57,497 --> 00:19:59,336
<b>Okay. Then,</b>

272
00:20:00,647 --> 00:20:01,859
<b>should I call the police?</b>

273
00:20:02,105 --> 00:20:03,907
<b>- Eun Ho.
- Don't.</b>

274
00:20:10,287 --> 00:20:11,348
<b>What do you want to do?</b>

275
00:20:13,771 --> 00:20:14,851
<b>Fine.</b>

276
00:20:16,476 --> 00:20:17,978
<b>Let the adults have a talk alone.</b>

277
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:21,214
<b>Why don't you wait in my car
with that guy?</b>

278
00:20:32,191 --> 00:20:34,294
<b>- Do you want me to be with you?
- No thank you.</b>

279
00:20:35,572 --> 00:20:37,708
<b>Well, my backpack and my phone...</b>

280
00:20:37,732 --> 00:20:39,566
<b>I'll bring them for you.
Get some rest here.</b>

281
00:20:52,179 --> 00:20:53,847
<b>Have you heard who I am?</b>

282
00:20:54,314 --> 00:20:55,314
<b>Yes.</b>

283
00:20:56,983 --> 00:20:58,952
<b>You're the chairman
of One Life Foundation.</b>

284
00:20:59,853 --> 00:21:00,853
<b>Min Sung...</b>

285
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,701
<b>must've been upset
because of my prank.</b>

286
00:21:04,725 --> 00:21:07,260
<b>- Well, about earlier...
- No.</b>

287
00:21:10,076 --> 00:21:11,076
<b>Me first.</b>

288
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,834
<b>I'm not a suspicious person,
so listen at ease.</b>

289
00:21:15,969 --> 00:21:17,404
<b>Confucius said that...</b>

290
00:21:17,569 --> 00:21:21,374
<b>a father is bound
to hide his son's mistake.</b>

291
00:21:21,641 --> 00:21:23,009
<b>It seems...</b>

292
00:21:23,317 --> 00:21:26,646
<b>you care about Ha Min Sung
like he's your son.</b>

293
00:21:26,691 --> 00:21:28,114
<b>I mean, I was mistaken...</b>

294
00:21:28,713 --> 00:21:31,151
<b>you for his father.</b>

295
00:21:33,019 --> 00:21:34,019
<b>All right.</b>

296
00:21:34,564 --> 00:21:36,289
<b>In that sense,</b>

297
00:21:37,647 --> 00:21:39,159
<b>I'll let you choose.</b>

298
00:21:39,767 --> 00:21:40,794
<b>Choose?</b>

299
00:21:41,027 --> 00:21:42,027
<b>One.</b>

300
00:21:42,562 --> 00:21:44,741
<b>Follow the world
and call the police.</b>

301
00:21:44,765 --> 00:21:46,132
<b>- Well...
- Two.</b>

302
00:21:47,178 --> 00:21:48,635
<b>Follow my way.</b>

303
00:21:51,438 --> 00:21:53,707
<b>What is your way?</b>

304
00:21:53,907 --> 00:21:55,408
<b>There's nothing much to it.</b>

305
00:21:56,082 --> 00:21:58,745
<b>An eye for an eye,
a tooth for a tooth.</b>

306
00:21:58,936 --> 00:22:02,215
<b>You'll feel the same fear
that Eun Ho must've felt.</b>

307
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:05,185
<b>Don't worry.</b>

308
00:22:05,986 --> 00:22:07,631
<b>You'll neither be harmed nor die.</b>

309
00:22:07,655 --> 00:22:09,789
<b>You didn't plan
to harm or kill Eun Ho either.</b>

310
00:22:10,532 --> 00:22:12,025
<b>You only tried to scare him.</b>

311
00:22:12,694 --> 00:22:13,793
<b>I'll do the same.</b>

312
00:22:15,161 --> 00:22:16,161
<b>All right.</b>

313
00:22:18,475 --> 00:22:19,602
<b>What's your choice?</b>

314
00:22:26,539 --> 00:22:27,539
<b>Okay.</b>

315
00:22:29,075 --> 00:22:30,510
<b>I'll follow your way.</b>

316
00:23:21,561 --> 00:23:23,963
<b>("The Life Before Us")</b>

317
00:23:49,656 --> 00:23:50,656
<b>Are you okay?</b>

318
00:23:52,267 --> 00:23:54,147
<b>If you don't mind,
why don't you go to my hotel?</b>

319
00:23:55,328 --> 00:23:57,430
<b>My room has a killer view.</b>

320
00:23:58,038 --> 00:24:01,367
<b>Let's go have your wounds treated
and eat some delicious food.</b>

321
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:04,037
<b>We can have a talk too.</b>

322
00:24:05,238 --> 00:24:06,673
<b>From the way I see it,</b>

323
00:24:06,772 --> 00:24:09,843
<b>you need to calm down a bit
before going home. That's why.</b>

324
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:12,245
<b>If your mom sees you now,</b>

325
00:24:15,601 --> 00:24:17,081
<b>she might be worried.
Don't you agree?</b>

326
00:24:17,869 --> 00:24:20,487
<b>- Okay.
- Good. Let's go.</b>

327
00:24:29,735 --> 00:24:31,431
<b>Where's my backpack?</b>

328
00:24:31,564 --> 00:24:32,676
<b>Mr. Oh.</b>

329
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,434
<b>That guy took it.</b>

330
00:24:34,534 --> 00:24:35,702
<b>He'll bring it to my room.</b>

331
00:24:36,103 --> 00:24:38,071
<b>Is he not going with us?</b>

332
00:24:39,702 --> 00:24:41,474
<b>We're moving in two cars.</b>

333
00:24:52,786 --> 00:24:55,054
<b>Who was it
that Eun Ho willingly followed?</b>

334
00:24:55,321 --> 00:24:56,523
<b>Someone from inside the hotel.</b>

335
00:24:57,876 --> 00:24:59,759
<b>Eun Ho knows him,</b>

336
00:25:00,693 --> 00:25:03,173
<b>and he knows Jang Ki Ho.</b>

337
00:25:06,984 --> 00:25:09,135
<b>- It's Mr. Baek.
- No.</b>

338
00:25:09,672 --> 00:25:11,148
<b>No, it can't be him.</b>

339
00:25:11,172 --> 00:25:12,415
<b>If it hadn't been for Sang Ho,</b>

340
00:25:12,439 --> 00:25:14,774
<b>Eun Ho wouldn't have been
able to have surgery that soon.</b>

341
00:25:15,108 --> 00:25:16,820
<b>He even provided a VIP ward
and a caregiver too.</b>

342
00:25:16,844 --> 00:25:18,077
<b>He needed Eun Ho to survive...</b>

343
00:25:18,482 --> 00:25:20,280
<b>because he had
important information.</b>

344
00:25:21,414 --> 00:25:23,854
<b>He got a VIP ward for Eun Ho,
and the caregiver is his person.</b>

345
00:25:23,879 --> 00:25:26,319
<b>It's perfect
to keep watch on the kid.</b>

346
00:25:26,653 --> 00:25:28,254
<b>All right, let's say he did it.</b>

347
00:25:28,823 --> 00:25:29,889
<b>Then why...</b>

348
00:25:30,422 --> 00:25:32,325
<b>did Eun Ho make
a drastic decision...</b>

349
00:25:32,452 --> 00:25:34,360
<b>to jump off this building?</b>

350
00:25:34,494 --> 00:25:35,628
<b>He's just a kid.</b>

351
00:25:35,887 --> 00:25:37,463
<b>If Sang Ho wanted something
from him,</b>

352
00:25:37,603 --> 00:25:39,065
<b>he could've just given it to him.</b>

353
00:25:39,507 --> 00:25:40,800
<b>I'm going to find that out.</b>

354
00:25:42,405 --> 00:25:44,604
<b>Why he had to make such a decision.</b>

355
00:25:50,998 --> 00:25:51,998
<b>Yes, Ms. Cha.</b>

356
00:25:52,258 --> 00:25:54,714
<b>- Where are you?
- I'm at Lee Young Sik's ward.</b>

357
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,760
<b>(Restricted Area)</b>

358
00:25:56,784 --> 00:25:57,517
<b>Yes.</b>

359
00:25:57,758 --> 00:26:00,286
<b>He's becoming more determined
to stay silent.</b>

360
00:26:00,653 --> 00:26:01,653
<b>It almost...</b>

361
00:26:02,441 --> 00:26:04,357
<b>looks like he's a monk
practicing silence.</b>

362
00:26:04,545 --> 00:26:07,537
<b>We haven't been able to confirm
his sister's address yet.</b>

363
00:26:07,561 --> 00:26:09,495
<b>- Her number...
- Ask the support team for help.</b>

364
00:26:09,562 --> 00:26:11,531
<b>You two should go straight
to Eun Ho's ward now.</b>

365
00:26:11,992 --> 00:26:14,334
<b>Stay with him until I get there.</b>

366
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,960
<b>Don't let anyone in the ward
except the medical staff or his mom.</b>

367
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:18,838
<b>Not even his caregiver.</b>

368
00:26:19,492 --> 00:26:22,308
<b>I found a new clue at the hotel.
I'll tell you the details later.</b>

369
00:26:22,479 --> 00:26:23,479
<b>Okay.</b>

370
00:26:26,516 --> 00:26:28,225
<b>Eun Ho fell off...</b>

371
00:26:28,249 --> 00:26:30,483
<b>about an hour
after he arrived at the hotel.</b>

372
00:26:31,175 --> 00:26:32,629
<b>I thought he was in the car...</b>

373
00:26:32,653 --> 00:26:34,754
<b>with the culprits
before he moved to the rooftop.</b>

374
00:26:35,221 --> 00:26:36,221
<b>Perhaps,</b>

375
00:26:36,937 --> 00:26:38,791
<b>he was in Mr. Baek's room.</b>

376
00:26:42,695 --> 00:26:44,564
<b>Have you ever been to his room?</b>

377
00:26:45,231 --> 00:26:46,231
<b>No.</b>

378
00:26:46,401 --> 00:26:47,600
<b>Don't you want to go?</b>

379
00:26:49,749 --> 00:26:51,504
<b>Dong Myung went there too.</b>

380
00:26:52,705 --> 00:26:55,608
<b>I wonder what he ate, saw,
and talked about there.</b>

381
00:27:05,353 --> 00:27:06,353
<b>Hi, Sang Ho.</b>

382
00:27:07,238 --> 00:27:08,238
<b>Are you busy?</b>

383
00:27:09,135 --> 00:27:11,391
<b>Why don't we have dinner together?</b>

384
00:27:12,808 --> 00:27:14,427
<b>With Ms. Cha.</b>

385
00:27:15,517 --> 00:27:17,864
<b>Why not? Where though?</b>

386
00:27:19,032 --> 00:27:20,032
<b>Here?</b>

387
00:27:21,868 --> 00:27:22,883
<b>Fine.</b>

388
00:27:23,929 --> 00:27:26,283
<b>Not now. After an hour.</b>

389
00:27:26,307 --> 00:27:27,740
<b>Okay. See you later.</b>

390
00:27:31,463 --> 00:27:32,779
<b>We're meeting in an hour.</b>

391
00:27:33,513 --> 00:27:34,513
<b>Thank you.</b>

392
00:27:35,267 --> 00:27:36,549
<b>It must not be him.</b>

393
00:27:37,161 --> 00:27:40,453
<b>It's true he's eccentric,
but he isn't the type of person...</b>

394
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,140
<b>who would cause harm to children.</b>

395
00:27:42,889 --> 00:27:43,923
<b>When I was little,</b>

396
00:27:45,301 --> 00:27:47,160
<b>I met him at church.</b>

397
00:27:48,427 --> 00:27:50,430
<b>He was staying
at the church orphanage.</b>

398
00:27:51,942 --> 00:27:53,533
<b>He was really nice to other kids.</b>

399
00:27:54,348 --> 00:27:56,602
<b>Even now, a lot of children...</b>

400
00:27:56,836 --> 00:27:58,918
<b>are getting benefits thanks to him.</b>

401
00:28:03,109 --> 00:28:04,277
<b>What about Seo Sang Won?</b>

402
00:28:05,609 --> 00:28:07,447
<b>Until his true face was revealed,</b>

403
00:28:07,777 --> 00:28:10,249
<b>he was known to be
affectionate to children.</b>

404
00:28:11,787 --> 00:28:13,353
<b>A scale of justice...</b>

405
00:28:14,907 --> 00:28:16,866
<b>can be tipped over one evil deed...</b>

406
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:18,898
<b>even if you've done good deeds
countless times.</b>

407
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,661
<b>Don't get the wrong idea.</b>

408
00:28:22,344 --> 00:28:24,297
<b>I'm not saying he's the culprit.</b>

409
00:28:34,473 --> 00:28:38,010
<b>It seems Ms. Cha isn't fond
of the story we made.</b>

410
00:28:38,214 --> 00:28:42,215
<b>But that's what I like about her.
It's a bit tiring though.</b>

411
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:43,287
<b>Sang Ho.</b>

412
00:28:43,583 --> 00:28:44,823
<b>We need to come up with a plan.</b>

413
00:28:44,951 --> 00:28:48,198
<b>She has started to suspect us.
And Eun Ho will wake up soon.</b>

414
00:28:48,222 --> 00:28:49,956
<b>Must we kill him?</b>

415
00:28:50,757 --> 00:28:52,191
<b>I want to keep him alive,</b>

416
00:28:52,232 --> 00:28:56,162
<b>have him by my side,
and change him little by little.</b>

417
00:28:56,368 --> 00:28:57,964
<b>Aren't you curious...</b>

418
00:28:58,097 --> 00:29:01,678
<b>if malice is innate or acquired?</b>

419
00:29:01,702 --> 00:29:02,969
<b>Do you think that's possible?</b>

420
00:29:03,259 --> 00:29:06,439
<b>You earn people's trust
by treating their biggest pain.</b>

421
00:29:06,586 --> 00:29:08,908
<b>To him, you're the biggest pain.</b>

422
00:29:10,438 --> 00:29:11,944
<b>What a shame.</b>

423
00:29:12,078 --> 00:29:13,880
<b>We shouldn't have brought him here.</b>

424
00:29:14,476 --> 00:29:16,149
<b>We wouldn't have to kill him then.</b>

425
00:29:21,487 --> 00:29:22,487
<b>Right.</b>

426
00:29:24,615 --> 00:29:27,160
<b>That was the worst move
which we hadn't expect.</b>

427
00:29:37,703 --> 00:29:39,071
<b>Do you like sweets?</b>

428
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:41,770
<b>Yes.</b>

429
00:29:42,275 --> 00:29:43,576
<b>So you don't.</b>

430
00:29:44,177 --> 00:29:45,645
<b>Bring something else.</b>

431
00:29:46,204 --> 00:29:47,547
<b>I like that one.</b>

432
00:29:48,114 --> 00:29:49,348
<b>I'll eat it.</b>

433
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:04,297
<b>You've got to eat this much
as you're still growing.</b>

434
00:30:06,412 --> 00:30:07,412
<b>You're smiling now.</b>

435
00:30:08,401 --> 00:30:10,736
<b>- Are you feeling better now?
- Yes.</b>

436
00:30:12,078 --> 00:30:13,625
<b>Thank you for helping me.</b>

437
00:30:13,649 --> 00:30:15,842
<b>I just happened
to be there at a perfect time.</b>

438
00:30:16,969 --> 00:30:19,078
<b>I was meaning to see you anyway.</b>

439
00:30:19,712 --> 00:30:21,791
<b>- Why?
- The person you saved.</b>

440
00:30:21,815 --> 00:30:23,460
<b>He's a close acquaintance of mine.</b>

441
00:30:23,484 --> 00:30:25,418
<b>- Really?
- Yes.</b>

442
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:27,602
<b>He's Jang Ki Ho.</b>

443
00:30:27,626 --> 00:30:30,300
<b>He goes to the same church as me.</b>

444
00:30:30,324 --> 00:30:32,458
<b>- What a funny coincidence, right?
- Yes.</b>

445
00:30:32,813 --> 00:30:34,304
<b>- Are you guys close?
- Yes.</b>

446
00:30:34,328 --> 00:30:36,406
<b>He's still recovering,</b>

447
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:39,766
<b>so I went to see you to thank you.</b>

448
00:30:42,281 --> 00:30:44,953
<b>Hey, I'm relieved you're all right.</b>

449
00:30:46,297 --> 00:30:48,908
<b>Eat up. Drink some tea too.</b>

450
00:30:55,586 --> 00:30:57,250
<b>When I was young,</b>

451
00:30:59,141 --> 00:31:00,753
<b>however loudly I cried and screamed,</b>

452
00:31:01,454 --> 00:31:03,322
<b>nobody came to help me.</b>

453
00:31:05,156 --> 00:31:07,156
<b>So I ended up giving up.</b>

454
00:31:08,461 --> 00:31:09,529
<b>On that day,</b>

455
00:31:11,469 --> 00:31:14,200
<b>I neither cried nor screamed.</b>

456
00:31:15,475 --> 00:31:17,770
<b>But someone came to my rescue.</b>

457
00:31:19,038 --> 00:31:20,172
<b>Like me?</b>

458
00:31:20,944 --> 00:31:21,944
<b>Yes.</b>

459
00:31:24,092 --> 00:31:25,714
<b>I slept really well that night.</b>

460
00:31:26,516 --> 00:31:29,351
<b>And I didn't feel lonely.</b>

461
00:31:31,733 --> 00:31:33,321
<b>I have a similar experience.</b>

462
00:31:40,733 --> 00:31:41,830
<b>Ki Ho told me...</b>

463
00:31:42,864 --> 00:31:45,200
<b>he left something with you.</b>

464
00:31:45,901 --> 00:31:47,901
<b>- Yes.
- Do you want me to give it to him?</b>

465
00:31:50,494 --> 00:31:51,619
<b>No.</b>

466
00:31:52,132 --> 00:31:55,001
<b>He said he'd come for it,
so I'll wait.</b>

467
00:31:55,702 --> 00:31:57,504
<b>Okay. Right.</b>

468
00:31:58,018 --> 00:31:59,056
<b>Sure.</b>

469
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:02,518
<b>Make sure you don't lose it.</b>

470
00:32:02,683 --> 00:32:05,346

00:47:52,492 --> 00:47:54,627
<b>I don't want to hurt her.</b>

627
00:47:55,266 --> 00:47:56,829
<b>But I won't have a choice.</b>

628
00:47:58,047 --> 00:48:00,085
<b>I still want to see her in torment.</b>

629
00:48:01,077 --> 00:48:02,154
<b>Let's go eat.</b>

630
00:48:09,695 --> 00:48:11,199
<b>- Wait outside.
- Yes.</b>

631
00:48:20,711 --> 00:48:23,508
<b>What's going on?
Mr. Lee also dropped by.</b>

632
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:26,244
<b>Let's have a seat and talk.</b>

633
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,460
<b>Aren't you going to tell me
what's going on?</b>

634
00:48:38,883 --> 00:48:40,351
<b>You still hate me, right?</b>

635
00:48:42,143 --> 00:48:45,063
<b>- Why would you bring that up now?
- But you still trust me, right?</b>

636
00:48:45,972 --> 00:48:49,442
<b>You know that Eun Ho is my friend,
and I'd do anything to protect him.</b>

637
00:48:52,291 --> 00:48:53,372
<b>I trust you.</b>

638
00:48:53,847 --> 00:48:55,600
<b>And I don't hate you.</b>

639
00:48:56,290 --> 00:48:57,761
<b>But I also don't like you.</b>

640
00:48:58,203 --> 00:49:01,573
<b>You're the most reliable person
I have now.</b>

641
00:49:02,007 --> 00:49:05,153
<b>Then listen to what I say.
Stay close to him for a while.</b>

642
00:49:05,177 --> 00:49:07,159
<b>- I will.
- And...</b>

643
00:49:07,183 --> 00:49:08,800
<b>don't trust anyone...</b>

644
00:49:09,314 --> 00:49:10,382
<b>but me.</b>

645
00:49:15,731 --> 00:49:19,032
<b>He was probably rappelling down,
and someone caught the rope.</b>

646
00:49:19,333 --> 00:49:22,169
<b>So he must have been pulled back up.</b>

647
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:24,803
<b>That's why he untied his belt.</b>

648
00:49:25,458 --> 00:49:28,519
<b>Our initial investigation was not
enough because of Dae Hoon's body.</b>

649
00:49:28,543 --> 00:49:31,325
<b>You two will go to the hotel,
meet the first reporter,</b>

650
00:49:31,349 --> 00:49:33,380
<b>and find out
if they found anything strange.</b>

651
00:49:33,498 --> 00:49:34,574
<b>Okay.</b>

652
00:49:40,042 --> 00:49:42,289
<b>Didn't you get the call
to stay away from here?</b>

653
00:49:44,209 --> 00:49:45,993
<b>I didn't hear it
from Eun Ho's mother.</b>

654
00:49:46,719 --> 00:49:49,006
<b>- I want to hear her say it.
- Just leave.</b>

655
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:51,030
<b>Are my records the problem?</b>

656
00:49:51,498 --> 00:49:52,766
<b>Did Sun Woo tell you?</b>

657
00:49:55,655 --> 00:49:56,974
<b>There must be a misunderstanding.</b>

658
00:49:56,998 --> 00:49:59,973
<b>This whole situation has nothing
to do with you.</b>

659
00:49:59,998 --> 00:50:02,533
<b>It's a measure I took
as the investigation made progress.</b>

660
00:50:02,709 --> 00:50:04,244
<b>Is it turning out bad for Eun Ho?</b>

661
00:50:07,111 --> 00:50:10,227
<b>Have you reported what happened
in the hospital to Mr. Baek?</b>

662
00:50:10,251 --> 00:50:12,592
<b>Yes, because he was curious
about Eun Ho's condition.</b>

663
00:50:13,353 --> 00:50:15,856
<b>Did something happen to Mr. Baek?</b>

664
00:50:15,957 --> 00:50:17,144
<b>Just go.</b>

665
00:50:17,858 --> 00:50:19,567
<b>Let me see Eun Ho's face
before I go.</b>

666
00:50:20,694 --> 00:50:21,828
<b>Not now.</b>

667
00:50:21,929 --> 00:50:24,215
<b>Aren't you curious
about my relationship...</b>

668
00:50:24,898 --> 00:50:26,099
<b>with Lee Sun Woo?</b>

669
00:50:26,951 --> 00:50:28,951
<b>He was my homeroom teacher
in high school.</b>

670
00:50:29,982 --> 00:50:31,662
<b>I smashed him with a chair.</b>

671
00:50:32,573 --> 00:50:35,442
<b>Whatever this is about,
I believe you have to talk...</b>

672
00:50:35,627 --> 00:50:36,693
<b>to Mr. Lee, not me.</b>

673
00:50:43,201 --> 00:50:45,761
<b>Are you the one who witnessed
the accident and reported it first?</b>

674
00:50:45,787 --> 00:50:46,391
<b>That's right.</b>

675
00:50:46,415 --> 00:50:48,044
<b>Did you go outside
right after you heard the sound?</b>

676
00:50:48,068 --> 00:50:51,035
<b>Yes. I heard the sound and went
to the site of the accident.</b>

677
00:50:51,059 --> 00:50:53,406
<b>It must've taken two minutes
at the most.</b>

678
00:50:53,627 --> 00:50:55,139
<b>I called 911 right away.</b>

679
00:50:55,163 --> 00:50:56,863
<b>Was there anyone around the site?</b>

680
00:50:56,925 --> 00:50:58,842
<b>No, but...</b>

681
00:50:58,866 --> 00:51:01,145
<b>when I called and told them
the name of the hotel,</b>

682
00:51:01,169 --> 00:51:03,810
<b>they said
the ambulance already took off.</b>

683
00:51:09,142 --> 00:51:11,542
<b>We're having a sumptuous feast
now that your brother is here.</b>

684
00:51:11,978 --> 00:51:13,714
<b>What did you put in here?</b>

685
00:51:14,084 --> 00:51:15,215
<b>Uncle.</b>

686
00:51:16,029 --> 00:51:17,918
<b>Don't be distracted,
and eat your food.</b>

687
00:51:18,959 --> 00:51:19,530
<b>Okay.</b>

688
00:51:19,554 --> 00:51:22,366
<b>You seem to have gotten lean.
Don't skip meals already.</b>

689
00:51:22,390 --> 00:51:24,368
<b>- Really?
- No, you look great now.</b>

690
00:51:24,392 --> 00:51:26,470
<b>- It's perfect.
- What do you mean?</b>

691
00:51:26,494 --> 00:51:28,195
<b>His cheeks are drawn.</b>

692
00:51:28,688 --> 00:51:29,840
<b>Oh, right. Ji Won.</b>

693
00:51:29,864 --> 00:51:34,568
<b>Who will you save
if your dad and uncle are drowning?</b>

694
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,937
<b>How can a child save an adult?</b>

695
00:51:38,939 --> 00:51:41,875
<b>Let's say you are a grownup.</b>

696
00:51:42,857 --> 00:51:43,857
<b>Uncle.</b>

697
00:51:45,921 --> 00:51:48,292
<b>- Why?
- You're bigger and stronger.</b>

698
00:51:48,316 --> 00:51:49,316
<b>Is that right?</b>

699
00:51:50,123 --> 00:51:51,251
<b>Is that why?</b>

700
00:51:52,638 --> 00:51:54,888
<b>Ji Won, listen carefully.</b>

701
00:51:55,188 --> 00:51:57,201
<b>Your dad can't swim.</b>

702
00:51:57,225 --> 00:51:59,069
<b>But your uncle is good at swimming.</b>

703
00:51:59,093 --> 00:52:01,361
<b>He's good at running and kendo too.</b>

704
00:52:01,576 --> 00:52:02,709
<b>Then I'll save Dad.</b>

705
00:52:03,430 --> 00:52:06,533
<b>Are you brainwashing her
to save your husband or what?</b>

706
00:52:06,566 --> 00:52:07,747
<b>Make sure you save me.</b>

707
00:52:07,771 --> 00:52:09,326
<b>- I'll save you both.
- Both of us?</b>

708
00:52:09,350 --> 00:52:11,860
<b>You better eat a lot
and grow up faster then.</b>

709
00:52:12,305 --> 00:52:13,305
<b>Eat up.</b>

710
00:52:15,185 --> 00:52:16,333
<b>- Is it tasty?
- Yes.</b>

711
00:52:16,357 --> 00:52:17,467
<b>Good.</b>

712
00:52:22,872 --> 00:52:23,872
<b>Dong Myung.</b>

713
00:52:29,790 --> 00:52:32,459
<b>- Don't act like we're close.
- It's late.</b>

714
00:52:32,659 --> 00:52:34,115
<b>- Where are you going?
- To earn money.</b>

715
00:52:34,139 --> 00:52:35,381
<b>To work part-time?</b>

716
00:52:35,862 --> 00:52:38,545
<b>Right, to work part-time?
Are you good now?</b>

717
00:52:41,982 --> 00:52:43,069
<b>A convenience store?</b>

718
00:52:43,503 --> 00:52:45,605
<b>A delivery center? A gas station?</b>

719
00:52:46,871 --> 00:52:47,941
<b>Are you okay?</b>

720
00:52:51,044 --> 00:52:53,814
<b>No. I want to harm myself.</b>

721
00:52:59,693 --> 00:53:01,899
<b>Be careful already.
Move the boxes quickly.</b>

722
00:53:01,923 --> 00:53:03,667
<b>Do you want to work all night long?</b>

723
00:53:03,691 --> 00:53:05,625
<b>What are you doing?</b>

724
00:53:16,933 --> 00:53:20,106
<b>- Hello, ma'am.
- Min Sung is missing!</b>

725
00:53:22,389 --> 00:53:23,389
<b>When?</b>

726
00:53:32,037 --> 00:53:34,755
<b>You two violated another law.</b>

727
00:53:35,122 --> 00:53:38,158
<b>Min Sung, you aren't allowed to work
because you don't have permission.</b>

728
00:53:38,792 --> 00:53:41,962
<b>Minors are not allowed to work
after ten o'clock at night.</b>

729
00:53:42,115 --> 00:53:43,163
<b>Didn't you know?</b>

730
00:53:43,684 --> 00:53:45,298
<b>I know,</b>

731
00:53:46,662 --> 00:53:48,663
<b>but he needs money to survive.</b>

732
00:53:52,295 --> 00:53:54,107
<b>What time do you finish work?</b>

733
00:53:54,296 --> 00:53:56,710
<b>- Six.
- Can you handle it?</b>

734
00:53:57,077 --> 00:53:59,379
<b>- Yes.
- I'll wait in the car.</b>

735
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,282
<b>- Let's have breakfast later.
- Okay.</b>

736
00:54:12,764 --> 00:54:14,124
<b>That's the situation up until now.</b>

737
00:54:14,701 --> 00:54:15,762
<b>And one more.</b>

738
00:54:16,196 --> 00:54:18,064
<b>- Ms. Yoon.
- Okay.</b>

739
00:54:18,832 --> 00:54:22,479
<b>Someone already made a report
before the first witness did it.</b>

740
00:54:22,503 --> 00:54:24,848
<b>The reporter had the voice
of a young woman,</b>

741
00:54:24,872 --> 00:54:27,374
<b>but the number was
under the name of a man in his 50s.</b>

742
00:54:30,443 --> 00:54:32,092
<b>Once the kid survives,</b>

743
00:54:32,116 --> 00:54:35,383
<b>he'll be a dangerous witness,
but they saved him without a hitch.</b>

744
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:39,386
<b>Because the kid has to be alive
for them to get the thing.</b>

745
00:54:40,042 --> 00:54:42,585
<b>It fits perfectly
with Ms. Cha's assumption...</b>

746
00:54:42,609 --> 00:54:44,450
<b>that the one behind everything
must be...</b>

747
00:54:44,474 --> 00:54:46,003
<b>the one that is after
what Jang Ki Ho gave to Eun Ho.</b>

748
00:54:46,027 --> 00:54:47,717
<b>If this map is right,</b>

749
00:54:47,741 --> 00:54:50,807
<b>it means one of them is the demon
that Lee Young Sik met.</b>

750
00:54:50,831 --> 00:54:54,211
<b>What on earth are they looking for
that they're causing all this mess?</b>

751
00:54:54,235 --> 00:54:55,802
<b>I'm curious like crazy.</b>

752
00:54:56,045 --> 00:54:58,772
<b>Mr. Han.
Why aren't you saying anything?</b>

753
00:54:58,872 --> 00:55:01,141
<b>That's who I am.
I'm taciturn and introverted.</b>

754
00:55:02,123 --> 00:55:03,743
<b>This will be a difficult fight.</b>

755
00:55:03,813 --> 00:55:05,984
<b>Our chief wanted
to close the stigmata case...</b>

756
00:55:06,008 --> 00:55:08,008
<b>and make it his achievement
before he retires.</b>

757
00:55:08,048 --> 00:55:10,127
<b>But Lim Hee Jung is involved
in another case.</b>

758
00:55:10,151 --> 00:55:12,963
<b>His superintendent position must be
higher than he expected.</b>

759
00:55:12,987 --> 00:55:15,809
<b>- Just follow our convictions.
- What, you punk?</b>

760
00:55:15,989 --> 00:55:17,233
<b>The case has gotten big,</b>

761
00:55:17,257 --> 00:55:19,634
<b>so let's resolve it nicely
and make it our achievement.</b>

762
00:55:19,659 --> 00:55:21,528
<b>And about the chief,</b>

763
00:55:21,886 --> 00:55:23,940
<b>he's going to leave soon anyway.</b>

764
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:25,465
<b>That makes sense.</b>

765
00:55:26,193 --> 00:55:27,844
<b>Ms. Cha. Continue.</b>

766
00:55:27,868 --> 00:55:28,967
<b>No.</b>

767
00:55:30,904 --> 00:55:31,905
<b>I'll do it.</b>

768
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:33,884
<b>How much do we know
about Jang Ki Ho's whereabouts?</b>

769
00:55:33,908 --> 00:55:36,687
<b>Byung Hee and I are checking
security camera footage.</b>

770
00:55:36,711 --> 00:55:39,323
<b>He left the hospital
and moved to Chueui-dong.</b>

771
00:55:39,347 --> 00:55:41,825
<b>Didn't Seo Sang Won use to live
in that neighborhood?</b>

772
00:55:41,849 --> 00:55:43,718
<b>Check the footage in the periphery
captured during the incident.</b>

773
00:55:43,742 --> 00:55:44,349
<b>Okay.</b>

774
00:55:44,373 --> 00:55:46,501
<b>For now, the only way
we can use against the hotel...</b>

775
00:55:46,525 --> 00:55:47,930
<b>is violating the fire law.</b>

776
00:55:47,954 --> 00:55:50,734
<b>We need a search warrant,
but under what ground...</b>

777
00:55:50,758 --> 00:55:52,735
<b>That is why we must find Jang Ki Ho.</b>

778
00:55:52,759 --> 00:55:55,639
<b>And Lee Young Sik too.
We must make him speak.</b>

779
00:55:55,663 --> 00:55:57,397
<b>We also need Ko Eun Ho.</b>

780
00:55:57,564 --> 00:56:01,244
<b>If he wakes up, we wouldn't even
need a warrant to arrest them.</b>

781
00:56:01,268 --> 00:56:02,579
<b>He's just a kid.</b>

782
00:56:02,603 --> 00:56:05,572
<b>How did he make such a choice
in that situation?</b>

783
00:56:05,888 --> 00:56:09,119
<b>I wouldn't have been able
to do anything if it were me.</b>

784
00:56:09,143 --> 00:56:11,655
<b>He's smart unlike kids these days.</b>

785
00:56:11,679 --> 00:56:13,982
<b>I think I know who influenced him.</b>

786
00:56:14,414 --> 00:56:16,889
<b>The investigation will become
complicated from now on.</b>

787
00:56:17,394 --> 00:56:18,862
<b>Do they look alike?</b>

788
00:56:19,255 --> 00:56:20,255
<b>They have a similar aura.</b>

789
00:56:20,279 --> 00:56:22,342
<b>Their faces look
somewhat similar too.</b>

790
00:56:22,367 --> 00:56:23,745
<b>That sounds about right.</b>

791
00:56:23,769 --> 00:56:25,928
<b>Could it be their personalities too?</b>

792
00:56:26,493 --> 00:56:28,194
<b>It'd be too bad for him then.</b>

793
00:56:30,834 --> 00:56:34,234
<b>Eun Ho is not like me.
He's sweet and thoughtful.</b>

794
00:56:35,170 --> 00:56:37,631
<b>That is why we could be friends
for a long time.</b>

795
00:56:41,299 --> 00:56:43,977
<b>(Ko Eun Ho)</b>

796
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:00,637
<b>We enjoyed the food a lot.</b>

797
00:57:00,661 --> 00:57:02,072
<b>- Thank you.
- Thank you.</b>

798
00:57:02,096 --> 00:57:04,741
<b>Your grandsons all look handsome.</b>

799
00:57:04,765 --> 00:57:06,299
<b>They should be actors.</b>

800
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:16,743
<b>Either one of you should sit
in the passenger seat.</b>

801
00:57:18,896 --> 00:57:20,547
<b>- Mr. Hwang.
- Yes?</b>

802
00:57:20,714 --> 00:57:23,116
<b>Can I go buy some beverages?</b>

803
00:57:23,685 --> 00:57:24,842
<b>Okay.</b>

804
00:57:48,212 --> 00:57:49,959
<b>The man Eun Ho saved.</b>

805
00:57:51,919 --> 00:57:53,646
<b>What about him?</b>

806
00:57:53,747 --> 00:57:55,982
<b>Maybe he isn't all better yet.</b>

807
00:57:56,716 --> 00:57:59,786
<b>He sent his acquaintance
to school to meet Eun Ho.</b>

808
00:58:00,286 --> 00:58:02,589
<b>- Did you tell him about Eun Ho?
- No.</b>

809
00:58:02,789 --> 00:58:06,069
<b>I didn't want to surprise him,
so I just took his number.</b>

810
00:58:06,093 --> 00:58:07,709
<b>Do you have it with you?</b>

811
00:58:07,861 --> 00:58:09,295
<b>- Yes.
- Give it to me.</b>

812
00:58:29,849 --> 00:58:31,728
<b>- Did you get the number?
- Yes.</b>

813
00:58:31,752 --> 00:58:34,287
<b>It's the man
who's in touch with Jang Ki Ho.</b>

814
00:58:35,863 --> 00:58:37,323
<b>I met him...</b>

815
00:58:37,471 --> 00:58:40,071
<b>on the day Seo Sang Won died.
We haven't been in touch since then.</b>

816
00:58:40,215 --> 00:58:44,152
<b>If he wasn't going to see you,
why did he ask you to meet the boy?</b>

817
00:58:44,804 --> 00:58:47,777
<b>He left your number, not his.</b>

818
00:58:47,801 --> 00:58:50,013
<b>I don't know anything
about his intention.</b>

819
00:58:50,203 --> 00:58:52,605
<b>Why are you
looking for Ki Ho though?</b>

820
00:58:57,951 --> 00:58:59,746
<b>If he calls you, tell him...</b>

821
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:03,883
<b>that the boy who saved his life
almost died because of him.</b>

822
00:59:24,370 --> 00:59:27,207
<b>(Baek Sang Ho)</b>

823
00:59:34,614 --> 00:59:36,282
<b>Did you sense anything?</b>

824
00:59:36,841 --> 00:59:38,219
<b>I told him
that Eun Ho almost died,</b>

825
00:59:38,243 --> 00:59:40,150
<b>but he wasn't surprised
nor did he ask me what happened.</b>

826
00:59:40,174 --> 00:59:41,287
<b>Tail him.</b>

827
00:59:49,295 --> 00:59:49,873
<b>Hi.</b>

828
00:59:49,897 --> 00:59:53,410
<b>Track his locations on the day
Eun Ho saved Jang Ki Ho...</b>

829
00:59:53,434 --> 00:59:55,115
<b>and the day after he had
his backpack snatched.</b>

830
00:59:55,139 --> 00:59:55,679
<b>Why?</b>

831
00:59:55,703 --> 00:59:58,615
<b>They took his backpack, but couldn't
find the thing and showed up to him.</b>

832
00:59:58,639 --> 01:00:00,874
<b>That means Eun Ho put the thing
somewhere else...</b>

833
01:00:01,074 --> 01:00:02,809
<b>- in those two days.
- Okay.</b>

834
01:00:03,365 --> 01:00:06,489
<b>It won't take long. Go to a cafe
for a cup of tea or something.</b>

835
01:00:06,513 --> 01:00:08,913
<b>I already did. Do it within the time
I finish drinking water.</b>

836
01:00:10,373 --> 01:00:12,752
<b>Let's do a round of sparring
after the case ends.</b>

837
01:00:12,952 --> 01:00:14,754
<b>I'm going to beat you up to a pulp.</b>

838
01:00:19,159 --> 01:00:20,693
<b>I'm not like how I used to be.</b>

839
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:39,092
<b>- Hello?
- I emailed it to you.</b>

840
01:00:39,116 --> 01:00:41,481
<b>Unless the kid didn't have
his phone with him,</b>

841
01:00:41,521 --> 01:00:44,150
<b>it's just the vicinity of the school
and his house.</b>

842
01:00:44,325 --> 01:00:45,325
<b>Thanks.</b>

843
01:01:53,001 --> 01:01:55,154
<b>- Yes.
- Hurry up and turn on the news.</b>

844
01:01:55,727 --> 01:01:57,657
<b>- Why?
- They're talking about you.</b>

845
01:01:59,233 --> 01:02:00,548
<b>This is an exclusive report.</b>

846

<b>Detective Cha, who was at the site

<b>has turned out to have been
a close friend of the eighth victim.</b>

<b>If the reason why she didn't give up
on catching the killer...</b>

849
01:02:11,472 --> 01:02:13,373
<b>for nearly 20 years was
for personal reasons,</b>

850

<b>not a sense of duty
as a police officer,</b>

851
01:02:15,141 --> 01:02:18,010
<b>we need to reconsider the situation
of that day.</b>

852
01:02:18,177 --> 01:02:20,289
<b>She's been known to have watched
the last of Seo Sang Won...</b>

<b>who committed suicide during

<b>on the day of the incident,

<b>Eun Ho.</b>

858

<b>I found out quite a lot.</b>

859
01:03:12,342 --> 01:03:13,807
<b>But seriously,</b>

860
01:03:15,810 --> 01:03:19,079
<b>were you fearless or brave?</b>

861
01:03:19,628 --> 01:03:22,482
<b>How did you think of jumping off...</b>

862

<b>of such a high building?</b>

863

<b>How did you think of unbuckling

864
01:03:33,325 --> 01:03:34,357
<b>Good job...</b>

865
01:03:35,301 --> 01:03:37,327
<b>for getting away from those thugs.</b>

866
01:03:38,161 --> 01:03:39,162
<b>No.</b>

01:03:42,721 --> 01:03:45,869
<b>Thank you for being alive.</b>

<b>You...</b>

<b>Did you wake up?</b>

871

<b>What about the flower pots?</b>

872
01:04:11,498 --> 01:04:12,498
<b>What?</b>

873
01:04:13,214 --> 01:04:14,330

<b>(Nobody Knows)</b>

<b>Should Eun Ho know the truth...</b>

877

<b>when nothing will change

878
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:45,996
<b>Does it mean he'll be in danger

<b>Pray to Father.</b>

<b>How come no one tells me

<b>I wish he doesn't remember it

<b>Ko Eun Ho woke up.</b>

<b>Is that true?</b>

<b>Is it true you let him go

<b>The disciplinary committee
