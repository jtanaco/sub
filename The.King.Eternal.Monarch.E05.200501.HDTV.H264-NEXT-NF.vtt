THE KING: ETERNAL MONARCH

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.830
JEONG TAE-EUL

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.710
I'm bored, let's play pool.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.630
EPISODE 5

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:28.640
Thank you for your kindness.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.930
I should repay you in cash,

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.810
but our worlds had different bills,
so I got you goods instead.

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.560
I hope you can get a satisfactory price.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.450
Where did you get this?

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.530
Did you find oil in your yard
or something?

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:57.710
Oh, Sin-jae.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.460
Can I get a sweet milk tea?

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:02.750
I guess Squad Three is off duty tomorrow.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.670
Yes, I was thinking of playing pool.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.760
I don't see the horse that was here.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.100
Maximus? It's been gone for a while.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.430
Everyone's been asking,
so I even wrote it on the sign out front.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.320
But Tae-eul isn't here.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.700
Who are you playing pool with?

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.240
-She's not here?
-Maybe she's back.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.490
She left with that King guy a while ago.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.790
THE HORSE ISN'T HERE

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.930
I'M BORED, LET'S PLAY POOL

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.970
Head Court Lady Noh, it's me.

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.640
His Majesty just came back,
and he has a guest.

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:59.900
It's a woman.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.730
Tell His Majesty to take a detour,

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.820
and use the sea route.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.150
He shouldn't be seen by people.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.820
Don't worry about the palace,
I'll make sure nobody talks.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.210
FOUR TIGER SWORD

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.260
I'm the King of the Kingdom of Corea.

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.060
And my name, which you cannot say,

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.610
is Lee Gon.

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:54.700
So

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:57.490
you do have a name.

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.710
If you really have a name,

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.920
I guess there's no way
to avoid a beheading now.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.680
From the way you talked to me so far,
it's only right to behead you right away.

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.100
-I'll escort you to the palace.
-Let me take care of Maximus first.

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.020
The trip had been too long for her age.

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.320
Come to the racetracks.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.620
Withdraw the guards from the racetracks
right now.

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.080
Two of you go to the control room
and get the security footage.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.080
The rest, follow me.

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.230
What is this place?

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.690
Is it some kind of a fourth dimension?

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.150
I'm not sure yet.

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.070
I guess we can say it's something between
1 and 0 in my world and yours.

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:21.120
This is a place that cannot be
explained scientifically.

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.210
Do you see that balloon?

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.000
Balloons usually pop within ten hours.

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.380
But that one has been floating
like that for over ten days.

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.510
It hasn't popped or floated away.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.220
It's exactly where I let it go.

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.730
That means there's no light,
wind or air here.

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:46.640
Isn't that amazing?

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:48.610
If it's not science, what is it?

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.280
Is it some kind of magic?

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.360
It could be a part of a legend.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.990
Time flows differently here as well.

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.740
One minute here is about an hour outside.

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.000
My watch stops here,

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:05.750
so I went back and forth
for several days to check.

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.630
How could you check when clocks stop here?

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.630
I used Euler's number.

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:17.630
I don't know how deep

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.140
or how vast this place is.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.680
I'll reach the edge of this place someday.

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:26.350
And I'll tell you

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:28.270
all about it.

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.480
But for today, let's go to my world.

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:47.910
Lady Maximus has a lower blood pressure
than last time,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.500
but it's still within a normal range.

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:53.420
"Lady"?

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.340
A horse is called a lady...

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.390
I will do another thorough checkup
in the morning, Your Majesty.

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:02.140
Please do.

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.610
I told you so. Everything I said to you
was true, wasn't it?

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.780
Don't you see that's driving me crazy?

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:22.820
If this is all real, it's terrifying.

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.790
And if it's not, that means I'm crazy.

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:27.080
You should watch your manners.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:28.790
And that face.

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:30.370
He is supposed to be on my side.

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.630
He's been on my side since I was three.

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.260
Is that gun real?

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.300
Can I take a look at it?

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:46.640
She knows how to handle it. Let her be.

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:49.430
She has to see for herself to believe it.

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:50.690
Believe what?

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.100
That she just crossed between 1 and 0.

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.700
No way.

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:07.290
This is real?

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:09.410
This P30

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:11.960
is actually real?

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:16.670
I'm going to check something.

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:19.170
It's nothing personal.

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:32.810
I told you. She can handle guns.

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:35.480
I'm letting this go just this once
because you're His Majesty's guest.

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:38.360
So...

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:39.980
This country...

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:41.990
And you being the King.

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:44.360
It's all real?

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:45.950
It's all real.

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:50.450
That gun, this world, and me.

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:53.920
So don't think of confirming that
by pulling the trigger.

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:58.210
This guy isn't going to move an inch.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:01.010
Loosen your grip

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:03.170
unless you want to get killed.

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:20.820
Your Majesty, is she...

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:21.900
Yes.

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:24.400
She's Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:28.120
Do you

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:29.870
know me as well?

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:54.890
Welcome to my palace.

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:10.990
This is Gwangyeongjeon.

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:12.580
It's my private residence.

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:15.080
Make yourself at home...

00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:21.840
Did you really have to do this?

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:25.260
Are you trying to worry me to death?

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:27.220
Head Court Lady Noh...

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:30.140
I think it has only been
about 10 minutes and 50 seconds

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.350
since she believed I'm a king.

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:36.810
She's the important person who knows

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:38.940
where the buttons came from.

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:44.230
It's nice to meet you. I'm--

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:48.360
Put all your belongings here in the box.

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:54.620
Everyone has to go through
a security check when entering the palace.

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:58.410
Everyone including the court ladies
and even the Prime Minister.

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:05.590
You reap what you sow.

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:21.350
You're giving them back
to me later, right?

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:24.570
I'll be penalized
if I lose my ID card again.

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:29.530
You recognize her face, right?

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:32.370
You're right.

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:38.080
Do I have to get frisked now?

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:39.660
We'll skip that.

00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:41.540
I should trust you.

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:43.960
You're my King's guest.

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:49.760
Let me talk to you for a moment.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:51.220
Now?

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:57.470
I'm sure you want to talk later.

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:01.600
But I also would have liked it
if you had left the palace later

00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:07.020
and brought a guest according
to the right procedures later.

00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:11.780
There were five guards and one person
at the stable who saw her.

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:15.320
Twelve court ladies who would be
suspicious of being

00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:16.990
-dismissed suddenly--
-I was on my way.

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:20.960
I needed to talk now anyway.

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:27.130
You should leave, too.

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:29.260
It's a King's order.

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:40.020
Don't worry.

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:41.980
Just wait here.

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:45.150
I'll ditch her somehow and come back.

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:47.690
My goodness...

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:50.190
You're really asking for it, aren't you?

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:55.780
I mean,

00:11:57.580 --> 00:11:58.530
Your Highness.

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.630
I guess that was the wrong thing to say.

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:10.050
She really believes it now.

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:13.340
That I'm the King.

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:26.060
My goodness, my head.

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:27.860
Oh, my heart.

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:30.150
My goodness.

00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:10.230
You have a meeting at 8 a.m.
regarding the 25th anniversary

00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:12.020
of your coronation with the staff.

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:15.950
And you have an appointment for tea
at 10 a.m. with press company CEOs,

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:18.200
then you must make the first throw
at the basketball

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:19.620
season-opening ceremony at 1 p.m.

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:20.660
Hang on.

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:23.240
I left the palace for just half a day,

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:25.200
and I have that many things to do?

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:28.750
Maybe someone in the court
has a grudge on you.

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:33.130
-Is there more?
-Yes.

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:35.510
You have a speech to deliver at 2 p.m.

00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:37.050
at the International Congress of
Mathematicians.

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:40.470
Then there is a flood relief supply
delivery ceremony at 4 p.m.

00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:42.470
You can go there by helicopter.

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:43.640
All right.

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:45.310
I'll do all that,

00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:47.180
so please let me eat dinner freely.

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:51.150
It's always suspicious
when you do something on your own.

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:52.860
You're crossing the line now.

00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:55.440
I'll be eating by myself in the study.

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:57.570
Alone.

00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:02.990
There is a guest in His Majesty's study.

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:05.870
You must keep that guest

00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:08.910
locked up in there
until I give other orders.

00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:28.180
Ironically, my first duty as a king

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:30.560
was to carry out
the funeral of the former king.

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:32.230
It was when I was eight.

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:48.290
I'm positive now

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:50.540
that it's a parallel universe.

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:53.540
Pardon?

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:56.000
Na-ri.

00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:58.550
Myeong Na-ri.

00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:00.510
Who's Myeong Na-ri?

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:04.640
I'm Myeong Seung-a
from the Royal Public Affairs Office.

00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:17.230
I know it won't be true,

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:19.530
but I just want to make sure.

00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:21.860
Don't you own a building?

00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:24.870
Didn't you rent it out
to a Taekwondo center?

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:31.120
I do own buildings,
but they're all in Canada.

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:34.250
Would you like some tea?

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:36.130
It's herb tea that will help you
have a good night's sleep.

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.800
You want me to fall asleep?

00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:44.390
I'd be grateful if you could.

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:46.510
I came here to keep an eye on you,

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:50.100
and you won't be able to leave
until Head Court Lady Noh says otherwise.

00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:52.310
It will be easy for both of us
if you sleep.

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:56.230
You're really straightforward,

00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:59.070
just like Na-ri.

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:02.190
I...

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:06.160
Can I use that laptop over there?

00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:09.200
Of course not. You can't use His Majesty's
laptop without his permission.

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:15.500
-It's the year 2019 here, right?
-Yes.

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:18.380
And was this room's owner born in 1987?

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:19.960
Of course.

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:22.590
And the cultural capital is Busan,

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:25.090
and there are 63 buildings
called 63 Building.

00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:26.970
There's only one 63 Building
in Yeouido, Seoul.

00:16:27.050 --> 00:16:27.890
That little jerk.

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:30.890
Did you just swear at me?

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:37.480
What would be the better answer?

00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:44.740
Can I have alcohol instead of tea?

00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:47.570
I'd love some soju.

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:53.870
Your Majesty, where did you go this time?

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:56.370
A parallel universe.

00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:24.740
Why do you need a laptop?

00:17:24.820 --> 00:17:29.030
I wanted to look some stuff up
on the internet.

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:35.750
It's a business phone,
so I can't lend it to you.

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:38.960
But if you tell me,
I'll read out the search results for you.

00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:41.500
I guess that will work.

00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:45.300
All right. Then...

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:47.170
Lee Gon.

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:52.100
What did you just say?

00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:53.470
Lee Gon.

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:56.680
Isn't the King's name Lee Gon?

00:17:56.770 --> 00:17:57.730
Have you lost your mind?

00:17:58.390 --> 00:18:01.020
Are you just casually
calling the King's name like that?

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:06.070
You don't even know the 63 Building,
and you don't know the King's age.

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:10.740
Who in the world are you?

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:13.490
Oh, did you live abroad for a long time?

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:15.580
But even so,

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:17.830
how could you be so indifferent
toward your home country?

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:19.750
Well...

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:22.750
This isn't my home country.

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:28.760
Well, my earth is still flat for me
so I can't explain.

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:32.300
Let's just say I'm an illegal immigrant.

00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:35.470
Oh, my gosh.

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:45.400
Can you leave us? It won't take long.

00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:54.830
She's an illegal immigrant.

00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:01.960
Why are you smiling?

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:04.920
I know someone who looks like you,
but you're so different from him.

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:06.250
I'm sorry about earlier.

00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:09.840
But were you always like this?

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:13.090
So prudent and serious?

00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:15.100
Hold this.

00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:18.770
I understand how you feel.
I went through that too.

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:37.120
I thought you'd need it,
so I made it easy for you.

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:38.910
I'm sure you won't find anything, though.

00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:42.710
You can ask your boss why.

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:45.420
He's a science guy,
so he'd be better at explaining.

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:50.380
Are you

00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:53.970
from a parallel universe?

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:56.010
Where the capital is Seoul,

00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:59.180
and the country's name
is the Republic of Korea?

00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:02.310
How do you know that?

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:08.070
Who are you?

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:11.240
What have you done to His Majesty?

00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:14.860
Did you make that weird scar
on his shoulder too?

00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:17.660
He has a scar on his shoulder?

00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:22.580
I don't know anything about that.

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:25.460
We're not close enough to show
each other's backs.

00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:29.210
And don't talk to me like that.

00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:31.800
You were born in 1991, right?
I'm a year older than you.

00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:37.590
Captain Jo.

00:20:57.410 --> 00:20:59.660
I said I wanted the halls empty.

00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:05.750
Your Majesty, I wanted to ask a few--

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:08.630
I know. I know you're curious

00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:10.960
and I understand why you want
to check her fingerprints.

00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:12.670
I'll send you a link.

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:14.590
It's about quantum mechanics.

00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:17.340
Send me your questions by text
after reading it.

00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:21.260
And will you open the door now?
The food is getting cold.

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:23.970
But Your Majesty.

00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:26.770
Didn't you get any alcohol?

00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:31.070
Your guest was asking for some.

00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:34.900
Yeong.

00:21:35.030 --> 00:21:35.940
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:40.070
Will you find out where the alcohol fridge
is located in the palace?

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:42.080
Pardon?

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:48.000
By the way,

00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:50.670
when do you think His Majesty saw me?

00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:53.250
I greeted him,

00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:57.050
but he said we'd met before
and that he was glad to see me.

00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:00.430
I had never met him before.

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:06.270
Was there anything notable
about the woman in there?

00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:08.600
-Except that she asked for alcohol.
-You shouldn't ask me.

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:11.230
I'm only going to report
to Head Court Lady Noh.

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:15.360
You're good at your job.

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:17.740
I feel so sad about

00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:19.320
missing this great opportunity.

00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:22.870
I have to go meet Head Court Lady Noh.

00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:24.740
I'll be off, then.

00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:39.050
-Did you just lock me up in here?
-I'm housing you.

00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:40.680
So be understanding.

00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:43.600
I brought you here
without saying anything.

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:47.270
Everyone's in a panic
because this has never happened before.

00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:48.770
Why are you so calm, then?

00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:52.650
I imagined bringing you here
lots of times before.

00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:54.150
Although it wasn't like this.

00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:59.900
Did you make a contract or something?
Did you buy land?

00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:06.160
I stopped myself from wiping it
on the wall because of your citizens.

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:08.750
You should promote that employee
who was watching me.

00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:09.870
She's a real patriot.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.210
Let me borrow your phone,
and give it to me unlocked.

00:23:13.670 --> 00:23:15.540
She wouldn't lend me her phone.

00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:17.840
What are you going to look up?

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:20.050
I'm sure you have nowhere to call.

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:22.760
None of your business.

00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:23.930
What's your passcode?

00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:26.010
Who would even try to look
through a King's phone?

00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:27.060
It's not locked.

00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:34.690
Pass me the snack.

00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:36.190
It's not a snack, it's dinner.

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:39.480
I thought you would be hungry.

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:43.110
You try it first.

00:23:45.370 --> 00:23:47.410
-What?
-I'm not joking.

00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:49.700
I'm Alice in Wonderland right now.

00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:53.170
She eats weird pills
and grows bigger and smaller and stuff.

00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:56.170
What if I eat this and die from poisoning
or natural causes and stuff?

00:23:57.500 --> 00:23:58.590
Don't worry.

00:23:59.130 --> 00:24:01.340
I keep my promises.
You'll die from a beheading.

00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:04.260
All right, then.

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:05.680
I'll enjoy the food.

00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:16.360
You made this yourself?

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:19.110
Yes. Is it good?

00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:20.900
No, it's bad.

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:27.700
I haven't done this for about 25 years,

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:29.740
but I should call my officials today.

00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:33.000
In this world,
if I say "Anyone out there?",

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:35.420
everyone will come rushing...

00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:38.750
Oh, gosh.

00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:45.510
Were you really standing outside the door?

00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:48.220
Do you think I have
that much time on my hands?

00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:51.310
And you were here this whole time?

00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:53.060
No, I came just a minute ago.

00:24:54.270 --> 00:24:55.480
I barely sat down.

00:24:57.810 --> 00:25:00.570
I prepared a bedroom and a meal
for your guest,

00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:05.320
but since she seems to have eaten,
I will escort her to her room.

00:25:06.570 --> 00:25:09.490
It is the farthest room from your room,
Your Majesty.

00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:22.300
I'll see you tomorrow. Get some sleep.

00:25:28.090 --> 00:25:30.220
I was talking to you.

00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:32.850
You should really sleep well.

00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:39.650
Is it far to the right
or to the left from my room?

00:25:40.770 --> 00:25:42.230
My goodness!

00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:55.330
Besides emergency situations,

00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:58.420
outsiders hardly ever stay

00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:00.580
in the palace overnight.

00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:06.510
So you must never speak
about what happened today

00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:08.220
anywhere or to anyone.

00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:13.890
You must keep everything a secret,
such as the structure of the palace

00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:17.310
or the private conversations
you've had with the King.

00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:19.690
You don't need to worry about that.

00:26:20.190 --> 00:26:22.060
I'm a government official, too.

00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:23.570
So I've seen.

00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:27.360
Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul.

00:26:31.410 --> 00:26:34.280
I've been meaning to ask this.

00:26:35.290 --> 00:26:36.500
How do you people

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:38.830
know me?

00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:42.790
A lieutenant in the police force?

00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:46.800
It is very strange.

00:26:48.050 --> 00:26:53.100
His Majesty has had a strange ID card
since he was young.

00:26:54.850 --> 00:26:59.430
There was no police officer named
Jeong Tae-eul in the Kingdom of Corea,

00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:04.770
and there is no such rank
as a lieutenant in the police force here.

00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:11.360
I thought that it was a fake ID
made as a joke or for some other reason,

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.490
but that nonexistent person

00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:16.370
suddenly appeared here.

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:19.750
It's shocking.

00:27:22.210 --> 00:27:24.330
Everything is just absurd,

00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:26.750
but there is one thing I'm sure about.

00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:31.930
An existence that cannot be explained
will only bring chaos to the world,

00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:34.220
and it will only harm our King.

00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:36.430
So

00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:38.810
during your stay here,

00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:43.230
please try to avoid contact

00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:48.020
with anyone besides the King,
the Chief of the Royal Guard, and me.

00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:53.360
Furthermore,
don't get curious about this world,

00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:55.780
and don't try to stay.

00:27:58.990 --> 00:28:00.540
And when I say "this world,"

00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:03.370
that includes the King.

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:12.150
I was right.

00:29:13.150 --> 00:29:14.280
It was far to the right.

00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:21.620
I thought you'd be glad to see me.

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:23.410
You came empty-handed?

00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:35.920
There's a bed and a sofa in here.
Why are you sitting on the floor?

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:39.390
There's a draft in here,
especially on the left side of the bed.

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:54.400
Why are you here?

00:29:56.570 --> 00:29:58.530
I didn't want to leave you scared
all by yourself.

00:29:59.910 --> 00:30:01.990
Trust me. I'm not a weird person here.

00:30:03.910 --> 00:30:07.620
Why did you use the window
instead of the door if you're not weird?

00:30:09.790 --> 00:30:10.790
You should know...

00:30:11.330 --> 00:30:12.540
That's the shortcut.

00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:14.670
The palace is really big.

00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:17.880
I thought you couldn't sit on the floor.

00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:20.760
It's not so bad, actually.

00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:24.560
And it feels kind of nice with the draft.

00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:35.650
When are you going to show me my ID card?

00:30:39.650 --> 00:30:41.030
-Tomorrow.
-Why tomorrow?

00:30:41.910 --> 00:30:43.330
Were you just pretending to have it?

00:30:43.910 --> 00:30:44.830
I do have it.

00:30:46.330 --> 00:30:47.910
You might try to go back to your world

00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:50.750
if I show you.

00:30:58.170 --> 00:30:59.170
What is it?

00:31:00.590 --> 00:31:01.590
What?

00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:12.100
The doll on my car key.

00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:14.400
It seems pretty cheap.

00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:26.330
SHOOTING, ARCHERY

00:31:26.410 --> 00:31:28.370
You can win this
if you hit the target seven times.

00:31:28.450 --> 00:31:30.830
But if you've served in the military,

00:31:30.910 --> 00:31:32.830
it'll be a piece of cake.

00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:35.790
It's 10,000 won for 10 bullets.
How many do you want?

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:37.170
I only need seven bullets.

00:31:56.820 --> 00:31:58.400
You should really know,

00:31:59.070 --> 00:32:01.700
nothing I have is cheap.

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:07.450
How much did you spend?

00:32:08.030 --> 00:32:10.370
Anyone who's served in the military
can do it with their eyes closed.

00:32:10.450 --> 00:32:11.370
I knew it.

00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:14.620
Everyone in your country is a swindler.

00:32:16.170 --> 00:32:18.750
Be quiet. There's someone
guarding the door outside.

00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:22.220
Are you stupid?
There are dozens of security cameras here.

00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:28.930
Is that a security camera?

00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:30.810
Wave to them.

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:33.310
Twelve people are watching us right now.

00:32:34.690 --> 00:32:35.770
For real?

00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:41.530
You believe everything I say now.

00:32:42.690 --> 00:32:43.650
That was a lie.

00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:48.070
Are you kidding me?

00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:51.410
So

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:53.960
is that really a security camera or not?

00:32:54.370 --> 00:32:56.540
It isn't. I was just joking.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.090
You want proof?

00:33:10.050 --> 00:33:10.890
Move.

00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:14.350
This might look romantic,

00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:16.980
but it's actually really uncomfortable.

00:33:17.730 --> 00:33:20.190
No, it's not uncomfortable at all.

00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:29.740
I'm going to ask you something,
so just answer with yes or no.

00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:32.200
Okay.

00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:34.830
You've never dated before, right?

00:33:36.790 --> 00:33:38.040
You startled me.

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:40.840
Yes,

00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:42.250
I have.

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:44.380
Should I guess when?

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:46.300
Guess.

00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:47.220
Now.

00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:55.350
Should I have done this?

00:34:19.290 --> 00:34:21.330
Try guessing what I just proved.

00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:23.800
The fact that I've dated before?

00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:25.260
Or

00:34:26.670 --> 00:34:28.170
that I'm dating right now?

00:34:52.270 --> 00:34:55.810
Did Squad Two find the weapon used
in their murder case?

00:34:56.190 --> 00:34:58.520
Chief Choe is begging me to help him out.

00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:02.320
I just handed the information over.
It's a common kitchen knife.

00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:04.070
Right.

00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:06.280
It'd be about this size.

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:07.240
I see.

00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:13.910
Here, here, and here.

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:17.460
And made sure the victim would die.

00:35:20.170 --> 00:35:21.840
Why is the world so dark?

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:23.760
Let's live a bright life.

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:25.380
As bright as a light bulb.

00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:30.890
I can't possibly be bright when
my husband is leaving home at this hour.

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:34.100
Come on, I don't want to leave.

00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:37.190
But I can't help it.
Sin-jae asked for just one glass...

00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:40.110
Don't make me work
after work hours have passed.

00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:43.980
I can check your call records
within ten minutes.

00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:48.570
Honey, wait. I'll push that.

00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:49.490
No, I'll do it.

00:35:49.570 --> 00:35:51.330
Honey, then could I put that in the car

00:35:51.410 --> 00:35:53.200
and just take a taxi
in front of the building?

00:35:53.290 --> 00:35:54.750
VIOLENT CRIMES DIVISION SQUAD 3

00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:13.600
CHIEF PARK

00:36:14.930 --> 00:36:17.850
I'm having a drink with you today.

00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:22.270
Who are you actually meeting, then?

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:27.400
Loneliness.

00:36:35.450 --> 00:36:37.750
I'M BORED, LET'S PLAY POOL

00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:53.100
I told you to sleep well,
but I guess you didn't.

00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:56.270
It's a Royal Guard uniform.

00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:00.100
You want me to run away in disguise?

00:37:01.650 --> 00:37:02.600
I won't let you do that.

00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:05.610
I have a full schedule today.

00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:07.940
Get dressed and come out.

00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:09.570
We have to leave
without Head Court Lady Noh noticing.

00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:14.990
If that was your plan,
you should've been more meticulous.

00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:27.710
My goodness, gracious.

00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:31.010
I made sure to separate you,
but you came here this early.

00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:34.510
Right, I guess it's better for you
to go outside.

00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:37.560
Come back as late as you can.

00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:40.850
And don't get any photos taken.
No photos together!

00:37:43.310 --> 00:37:44.150
My goodness.

00:37:50.490 --> 00:37:51.900
This was my plan all along.

00:37:52.610 --> 00:37:54.110
I've succeeded.

00:37:57.030 --> 00:37:58.660
You said you weren't a weird person here.

00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:14.260
IT'S MY VERY FIRST TIME
SEEING HIS MAJESTY IN PERSON!

00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:31.940
His Majesty will

00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:35.070
make the first throw
for our victory today.

00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:37.030
Please give a round of applause.

00:38:49.630 --> 00:38:51.170
Please give a round of applause

00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:55.090
and a loud cheer for the King
who did the first throw for us.

00:39:01.770 --> 00:39:03.100
The architect Richard Fuller said,

00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:05.850
"When I find a solution to a problem,

00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:10.860
I know that I am wrong if the solution
is not beautiful."

00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:14.030
So I'm giving you this advice

00:39:15.070 --> 00:39:19.120
as an amateur mathematician
and also as your King.

00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:22.490
WALK

00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:24.500
Leave your lab
for at least 30 minutes a day.

00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:27.920
Your labs

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:30.170
need to be cleaned.

00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:38.390
Get plenty of rest.

00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:41.970
Your bodies are not infinite decimals.

00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:44.770
ATMOSPHERE

00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:49.520
Share beautiful moments
with your lovers or family.

00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:53.030
Even mathematicians can do it.

00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:07.210
You are all proud mathematicians
of the Kingdom of Corea.

00:40:08.210 --> 00:40:09.630
Whatever problem you are working on,

00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:13.170
I hope your solution and your answer

00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:16.050
are both beautiful.

00:40:34.650 --> 00:40:35.480
Wasn't I cool?

00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:39.320
Yes, you were.

00:40:41.110 --> 00:40:41.950
I think so, too.

00:40:42.030 --> 00:40:44.030
I've thought that for a long time.

00:40:57.170 --> 00:40:58.050
Captain Jo.

00:40:58.130 --> 00:40:59.720
Please do as I requested.

00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:07.060
Can you look this way, please?

00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:16.820
It doesn't seem to be a present.

00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:19.240
"I got you out of the palace
since you might stay locked up

00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:20.780
in the study.

00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:22.700
Have fun. I'll see you in the evening."

00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:26.910
That is what His Majesty said.

00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:30.750
His Majesty has other duties to attend to,
so you're on your own now.

00:41:38.050 --> 00:41:38.960
"Oh, thanks.

00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:41.220
It's totally my style."

00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:44.180
Tell him I said that.

00:41:47.010 --> 00:41:47.890
But...

00:41:49.350 --> 00:41:50.310
Do you have some money?

00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:54.900
I bought your boss
chicken and stuff in the other world.

00:42:07.660 --> 00:42:09.700
It takes about 50 minutes
to the disaster area.

00:42:09.790 --> 00:42:12.500
The relief supplies
have been delivered by train.

It's fine, just go.

00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:11.810
You should accept my help.

00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:14.180
Did you receive the photos?

00:43:22.730 --> 00:43:24.440
What are these? Did you send these?

00:43:25.650 --> 00:43:26.820
Did you photoshop me?

00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:28.990
You're crazy.

00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:32.410
This must be a new scamming method,
but you've chosen the wrong person.

Born on July 12th, 1989.

00:43:46.130 --> 00:43:47.470
How do you know my birthdate?

00:43:47.930 --> 00:43:50.600
The granddaughter of the founder
of a large pharmaceutical company.

00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:52.760
Marries the first son of a rich family

00:43:52.850 --> 00:43:56.560
after meeting him
at a yacht club in America.

00:43:57.140 --> 00:44:00.150
And the first baby
is born after four months.

00:44:01.270 --> 00:44:04.190
This is your life.

00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:07.740
If you want it to be.

00:44:11.830 --> 00:44:14.790
I've never chosen the wrong person.

00:44:16.250 --> 00:44:19.620
The woman in these photos is you.

00:44:21.250 --> 00:44:22.090
To be exact,

00:44:23.170 --> 00:44:24.670
it's you in another world.

00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:27.800
In this world,

00:44:31.180 --> 00:44:33.350
you're living in hell.

00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:54.240
How did you get these photos?

00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:57.500
Did you come into my house?

00:44:57.580 --> 00:44:59.540
You have a useless lock,

00:45:00.750 --> 00:45:02.960
a window with no sunlight coming through,

00:45:03.630 --> 00:45:05.920
and walls that can't protect you
from the cold nor the heat.

00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:08.050
Is that house any different

00:45:08.670 --> 00:45:09.760
from a grave?

00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:12.930
How about giving your daughter

00:45:13.930 --> 00:45:15.970
a house, a car,

00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:19.180
and parents like this?

00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:24.730
Instead of used garbage like that.

00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:29.900
How do you know it's a girl?

00:45:33.450 --> 00:45:34.570
You...

00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:38.160
Whether you're a swindler or a member
of a cult, you've got the wrong person.

00:45:38.250 --> 00:45:39.500
I'm sending you to jail.

00:45:41.210 --> 00:45:43.500
112 crime report. How may I help you?

00:45:48.090 --> 00:45:49.460
Hello? You may speak.

00:45:57.010 --> 00:45:58.390
Who are you?

00:45:58.970 --> 00:46:01.180
Someone who's going to save your life.

00:46:01.770 --> 00:46:03.060
How are you going to do that?

00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:07.150
What do I have to do

00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:12.490
to get that?

00:46:13.700 --> 00:46:16.030
You just have to kill the other you.

00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:19.910
All right, then...

00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:25.630
Would you like to change

00:46:26.580 --> 00:46:27.920
your miserable life?

00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:31.920
What are you going to do

00:46:32.550 --> 00:46:33.510
if I say no?

00:46:34.090 --> 00:46:35.550
I already saw your face.

00:46:37.550 --> 00:46:38.680
Am I going to die

00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:40.560
instead of

00:46:41.270 --> 00:46:42.100
her?

00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:44.770
Well, I haven't thought about that yet.

00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:50.280
Nobody has refused until now.

00:46:57.160 --> 00:46:58.160
It's okay

00:46:58.950 --> 00:47:01.200
for you to be the first exception.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.460
It'll be interesting to me.

00:47:07.630 --> 00:47:08.460
Wait.

00:47:08.790 --> 00:47:11.000
Wait...

00:47:14.470 --> 00:47:15.380
How

00:47:19.260 --> 00:47:21.180
should I contact you?

00:47:29.650 --> 00:47:30.820
I'll be the one

00:47:31.610 --> 00:47:32.980
to contact you.

00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:37.610
It's an urgent report from
the Ministry of National Defense.

00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:39.950
A Chinese fishing boat
sent a distress signal

00:47:40.030 --> 00:47:41.910
in the intermediate zone of the East Sea.

00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:44.870
The Yi Sun-sin Destroyer
that was nearby received the signal.

00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:47.120
Are they sure it's a fishing boat?

00:47:47.210 --> 00:47:48.460
Yes, they confirmed it.

00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:51.960
They say it must've been stranded
because of the severe fog and swells.

00:47:52.050 --> 00:47:53.840
This happened last spring as well.

00:47:54.340 --> 00:47:56.930
The Japanese Navy
could interfere again, right?

00:47:57.090 --> 00:48:00.050
Yes, after Japan broke off
the EEZ agreement,

00:48:00.140 --> 00:48:02.390
both Japan and China
are sensitive about such things.

00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:04.100
Let's just think simply.

00:48:04.270 --> 00:48:06.560
We'll be more aggressive
at the next negotiation with Japan,

00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:08.600
and rescue those people
since we got the signal.

00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:12.610
And tell our people to ask them
why they keep fishing in our waters.

00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:15.320
Yes, ma'am.

00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:30.500
CERTIFICATE OF APPOINTMENT
KOO SEO-RYEONG

00:48:30.580 --> 00:48:32.170
The King of the Kingdom of Corea

00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:34.130
accepts the people's decision

00:48:34.750 --> 00:48:37.510
and allows Prime Minister Koo
to form the Cabinet.

00:48:42.890 --> 00:48:44.930
I hope you become a Prime Minister
who values the citizens.

00:48:46.980 --> 00:48:48.690
I will do my best, Your Majesty.

00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:53.690
What kind of Prime Minister
should I be to you?

00:48:56.570 --> 00:48:59.740
Please be a Prime Minister
who mostly gives written reports.

00:49:09.660 --> 00:49:10.710
Prime Minister Koo.

00:49:10.790 --> 00:49:12.710
I can never be indebted to you.

00:49:13.330 --> 00:49:15.920
Let's wait and see how my absence
will be historically recorded

00:49:17.090 --> 00:49:18.470
in the pages of history books.

00:50:07.220 --> 00:50:09.100
RELICS EXHIBITION
KINGDOM OF COREA

00:50:21.070 --> 00:50:22.200
My gosh, no way.

00:50:23.740 --> 00:50:24.610
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:25.530
It's fine.

00:50:30.700 --> 00:50:33.000
KINGDOM OF COREA MAINTAINS
4TH HIGHEST GDP IN THE WORLD

00:50:33.580 --> 00:50:34.420
Fourth?

00:50:36.670 --> 00:50:37.750
The Republic...

00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:41.420
I mean, the Kingdom of Corea's
GDP is that high?

00:50:41.510 --> 00:50:44.260
We export rare-earth elements
internationally.

00:50:44.970 --> 00:50:46.140
It's even in school textbooks.

00:50:47.350 --> 00:50:50.100
I'm sorry, but what are
rare-earth elements?

00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:52.350
It's always mentioned in exams.

00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:54.520
Cerium, lanthanum, yttrium, samarium...

00:50:57.310 --> 00:50:58.440
Are you a foreigner?

00:51:01.150 --> 00:51:02.990
Yeah, something like that.

00:51:04.150 --> 00:51:06.240
So, what are they?

00:51:06.490 --> 00:51:08.120
Well, they're minerals.

00:51:08.740 --> 00:51:12.290
There are 30 million tons
just in the northern area, and in the sea.

00:51:12.370 --> 00:51:16.040
Anyway, those minerals in the northern
area are worth 20 billion dollars a ton,

00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:18.380
so it'd be about six quintillion dollars.

00:51:18.460 --> 00:51:22.300
And that's all owned
by the Kingdom of Corea?

00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:23.630
Oh, no.

00:51:24.340 --> 00:51:26.840
The mountains where they're buried
are owned by the royal court,

00:51:27.890 --> 00:51:29.510
so they're actually the King's.

00:51:36.060 --> 00:51:37.150
It's a diamond?

00:51:37.900 --> 00:51:40.650
If that's a diamond, I'm Princess Diana.

00:51:41.690 --> 00:51:42.570
A king?

00:51:43.070 --> 00:51:45.990
You're a total nutjob.
This is so ridiculous.

00:51:49.530 --> 00:51:51.370
ROYAL COURT OF KINGDOM OF COREA

00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:54.620
You're really one
or the other, aren't you?

00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:10.550
CTX MOUNT KUMGANG NATIONAL PARK
AUTUMN LEAVES TOUR TRAIN

00:52:11.140 --> 00:52:12.310
BUSAN

CTX TRAINS
TO MOKPO TO MOUNT PAEKTU

00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:25.280
The CTX train

00:52:25.990 --> 00:52:30.070
bound for Pyongyang is ready to depart
on platform number three.

00:52:30.820 --> 00:52:31.660
BUSAN STATION TO SEOUL STATION

00:52:31.740 --> 00:52:34.660
Passengers, please check the ticket

00:52:34.740 --> 00:52:36.910
and board the train immediately.

00:52:37.910 --> 00:52:39.540
Sir. Over there.

00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:47.470
Hey, look who it is. Isn't that Luna?

00:52:48.260 --> 00:52:49.680
She even changed her hairstyle.

00:52:50.260 --> 00:52:51.340
-Hey.
-Yes, sir.

00:52:51.430 --> 00:52:52.600
-Get her.
-Yes, sir.

00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:58.060
Who are you to block my way?
Do you have a death wish?

00:52:58.230 --> 00:52:59.600
You're...

00:52:59.690 --> 00:53:00.810
Yes, I'm Jo Yeong.

00:53:02.190 --> 00:53:03.190
You got out quickly.

00:53:04.360 --> 00:53:06.820
-What did you say that woman's name was?
-Luna.

00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:09.070
You know, the one
we were chasing last time.

00:53:09.150 --> 00:53:10.150
Are you sure?

00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:11.660
She took off with our boss' money

00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:14.120
and even got a new hairstyle with it.
How could we forget her?

00:53:14.490 --> 00:53:16.790
Our boss is still in jail because of her.

00:53:16.870 --> 00:53:19.120
-But that bitch is wandering around--
-All right. Get lost.

00:53:19.710 --> 00:53:20.920
She's my guest for now.

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:22.460
Don't make me repeat myself.

00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:55.780
Prime Minister, you're so pretty!

00:53:55.870 --> 00:53:57.120
You're so pretty!

00:53:57.370 --> 00:53:59.080
Prime Minister, you're so pretty!

00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:02.790
RELATIVE SEARCH RESULTS TO LEE GON,
LEE GON AND KOO SEO-RYEONG MARRIAGE

00:54:02.870 --> 00:54:04.630
Prime Minister, make sure to eat well.

00:54:04.710 --> 00:54:06.210
-Love you all!
-Me too, Prime Minister!

00:54:06.290 --> 00:54:07.460
Stay healthy!

00:54:14.140 --> 00:54:16.220
You're six months pregnant,
but you still look slim.

00:54:16.390 --> 00:54:18.430
I watch my figure even more than
before I got married.

00:54:18.560 --> 00:54:20.140
My husband didn't want me to gain weight.

00:54:20.270 --> 00:54:22.060
Right, don't end up like me.

00:54:22.520 --> 00:54:24.150
My husband cheated on me

00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:26.110
when I was seven months pregnant.

00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:30.440
Excuse me.

00:54:30.940 --> 00:54:32.320
I guess Seo-ryeong is coming.

00:54:32.610 --> 00:54:35.240
I've just lost my appetite.
Did she have to come?

00:54:35.820 --> 00:54:36.870
I'm leaving first.

00:54:36.950 --> 00:54:38.490
-You're leaving?
-Yeah.

00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:47.880
Did she just leave?

00:54:47.960 --> 00:54:49.630
She said she lost her appetite.

00:54:50.250 --> 00:54:52.800
The food isn't even served yet.
That's nonsense.

00:54:53.050 --> 00:54:54.180
Didn't you know?

00:54:54.260 --> 00:54:56.340
Congressman Park Cheol-ung,
the one involved in the sex scandal.

00:54:56.430 --> 00:54:57.720
He's her sister-in-law's brother-in-law.

00:54:57.800 --> 00:54:59.060
So what?

00:54:59.140 --> 00:55:00.770
I barely remember my sister-in-law's face.

00:55:00.850 --> 00:55:03.810
Bad things keep happening
to people who oppose you.

00:55:04.940 --> 00:55:08.560
Rumors say the only one
who benefits from the scandal is you.

00:55:09.070 --> 00:55:10.820
The person who benefits the most

00:55:11.230 --> 00:55:12.190
is usually the culprit.

00:55:12.780 --> 00:55:15.700
It's just that the people who oppose me
happen to have dark secrets.

00:55:16.490 --> 00:55:19.740
My husband says Prince Buyeong
has your back.

00:55:20.200 --> 00:55:22.040
-Is that true?
-What if it is?

00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:24.120
Does he want to take sides with me?

00:55:24.750 --> 00:55:25.790
Can he?

00:55:26.870 --> 00:55:28.670
Are the Royal Family your in-laws now?

00:55:29.250 --> 00:55:30.800
Is that why you're serving another term?

00:55:30.920 --> 00:55:32.210
You really think she can?

00:55:32.630 --> 00:55:35.840
That "I studied while selling fish"
doesn't work anymore.

00:55:37.260 --> 00:55:39.390
A queen with no term limit is better

00:55:39.510 --> 00:55:41.720
than a Prime Minister
with a five-year term.

00:55:41.810 --> 00:55:44.730
But I'm not sure
if His Majesty likes old women.

00:55:46.850 --> 00:55:49.520
Do you want to see
if it still works or not?

00:55:51.070 --> 00:55:53.110
What will you do if the priority
for the remainder of my term

00:55:53.190 --> 00:55:55.950
is to do a tax investigation into
your husband's company, Sungwoon Group?

00:55:57.240 --> 00:55:59.950
What'll you do
if I obsess over that like a lunatic?

00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:04.500
Aren't you going to leave?

00:56:05.710 --> 00:56:09.290
I don't think our conversation
will be good for your baby.

00:56:13.210 --> 00:56:14.210
Auntie's sorry about that.

00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:43.700
SEOUL JONGNO POLICE STATION

00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:00.720
Excuse me.

00:57:03.890 --> 00:57:06.390
Don't you know me?

00:57:07.390 --> 00:57:08.310
It's Jeong Tae-eul.

00:57:08.980 --> 00:57:09.890
Don't you know?

00:57:09.980 --> 00:57:10.980
Well...

00:57:11.270 --> 00:57:12.310
Do you know her?

00:57:16.570 --> 00:57:18.320
No, I don't. Who are you?

00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:20.910
Then what about Kang Sin-jae? Or Jangmi?

00:57:21.160 --> 00:57:23.570
Or what about Director Kim Hee-ju
from Forensics?

00:57:23.660 --> 00:57:25.410
I'm not sure who they are.

00:57:25.490 --> 00:57:28.120
The names sound like
they are kind-hearted people...

00:57:28.700 --> 00:57:29.660
What is this about?

00:57:30.330 --> 00:57:31.460
Are you visiting the station?

00:57:33.710 --> 00:57:34.790
Are you a detective?

00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:40.470
No, it's nothing. I guess I was mistaken.

00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:43.390
Enjoy your meal.

00:57:44.470 --> 00:57:45.550
-All right.
-Oh, okay.

00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:52.440
You've been on the news
too often these days.

00:57:52.730 --> 00:57:55.650
Yeah, I was so shocked.
I look so good on screen.

00:57:55.730 --> 00:57:56.570
You looked so cool.

00:57:56.650 --> 00:57:58.360
What do you want to eat?
I want ox bone soup.

00:57:58.440 --> 00:57:59.740
I want ox knee soup.

00:58:00.740 --> 00:58:04.910
Hey, but how did she know
we were on our way to eat?

00:58:12.210 --> 00:58:13.170
Bye.

00:58:18.210 --> 00:58:20.590
-Let's eat ox knee soup.
-All right. There's a place I know.

00:58:20.670 --> 00:58:24.390
It's been there for 50 years, and
the bone soup tastes just like knee soup.

00:58:24.470 --> 00:58:25.680
Don't be ridiculous.

00:58:44.820 --> 00:58:46.620
If he hasn't become a detective...

00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:48.990
Right...

00:58:49.740 --> 00:58:51.410
It means his family didn't get bankrupt.

00:58:52.750 --> 00:58:55.210
The Kang Sin-jae of the Kingdom of Corea

00:58:56.040 --> 00:58:57.040
is so cool.

00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:01.800
Wow.

01:00:19.330 --> 01:00:20.210
Oh, hey.

01:00:21.210 --> 01:00:22.550
I'm running into you often lately.

01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:24.960
And you're still eating sweets.

01:00:25.550 --> 01:00:28.510
I don't eat sweets that often,
but I keep getting caught eating them.

01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:32.350
-What are you doing in this neighborhood?
-I live around here.

01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:36.600
Well, I used to live around here.

01:00:38.310 --> 01:00:39.690
I guess you're having a gathering today.

01:00:41.690 --> 01:00:43.070
I'm just going to have some drinks.

01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:45.440
This won't be enough
if I start drinking in the daytime.

01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:47.240
Do you want one?

01:00:56.750 --> 01:00:59.170
Is it okay for a psychiatrist
to be an alcoholic?

01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:03.250
I'm not that dependent.
I have a high alcohol tolerance.

01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:06.550
But are sweets really effective?

01:01:09.010 --> 01:01:11.090
It's just nice
because it's sweet and melts fast.

01:01:11.180 --> 01:01:13.640
Isn't it better for it to melt
slowly if it's sweet?

01:01:13.890 --> 01:01:15.010
It's going to melt anyway.

01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:20.140
By the way, what's your job?

01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:24.650
I thought I'd ask you at the next session,
but you didn't come.

01:01:26.730 --> 01:01:28.740
-I'm a detective.
-Really?

01:01:29.570 --> 01:01:31.320
I guessed totally wrong.

01:01:32.450 --> 01:01:35.030
-I thought you were a gangster.
-What kind of psychiatrist...

01:01:36.790 --> 01:01:38.120
That's why the meds didn't work.

01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:40.040
You probably didn't even take them.

01:01:42.210 --> 01:01:44.130
When did you move away
from this neighborhood?

01:01:44.540 --> 01:01:47.380
I've always lived here,
so we could've run into each other...

01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:55.140
Yes. I told you that my family
got bankrupt when I was little.

01:01:56.810 --> 01:01:58.390
We moved out when I was in middle school.

01:02:00.770 --> 01:02:02.390
The house prices here
went up a lot, right?

01:02:02.940 --> 01:02:05.810
I visit here sometimes,
but I feel so bitter.

01:02:07.860 --> 01:02:10.820
What do you think makes you
keep returning to this place?

01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:15.120
Do you still have
the same recurring nightmares?

01:02:18.620 --> 01:02:20.290
Don't start a session
so suddenly like this.

01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:22.870
Especially when you're drinking.

01:02:23.290 --> 01:02:24.920
You're treating me like some quack.

01:02:27.590 --> 01:02:29.090
All right, let's just drink then.

01:02:44.810 --> 01:02:47.770
I'M BORED, LET'S PLAY POOL

01:02:50.150 --> 01:02:51.190
Jeong who?

01:02:51.690 --> 01:02:52.650
SUIM ORIENTAL CLINIC

01:02:52.740 --> 01:02:54.320
Jeong Do-in.

01:02:54.820 --> 01:02:58.120
He's a Taekwondo instructor
at a Taekwondo center.

01:02:58.740 --> 01:03:00.200
I don't know anyone by that name.

01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:04.420
Then...

01:03:07.750 --> 01:03:11.960
How about a woman named Ahn Bong-hui?

01:03:13.090 --> 01:03:14.050
Do you know her?

01:03:14.130 --> 01:03:16.140
Her face looks really similar to mine.

01:03:16.340 --> 01:03:18.680
Have you ever seen her?

01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:20.760
Ahn Bong-hui?

01:03:21.770 --> 01:03:22.770
No, I haven't.

01:03:23.350 --> 01:03:25.310
We've lived here for 30 years.

01:03:25.940 --> 01:03:28.060
Why? Did they say they live here?

01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:31.070
No, never mind. Thank you.

01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:45.370
It's 41,800 won.

01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:46.540
Oh, right. One second.

01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:59.140
I'm sorry, but how much
is a standing ticket?

01:04:00.260 --> 01:04:01.640
It's 34,800 won.

01:04:06.140 --> 01:04:09.100
I rode a taxi
without thinking about the ticket.

01:04:10.110 --> 01:04:13.690
I'm sorry,
but is there a bus terminal in Gangnam?

01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:15.320
There's one in Songpa-gu.

01:04:16.070 --> 01:04:18.990
But even if you go now,
you'd miss the last bus.

01:04:19.490 --> 01:04:20.740
Don't you have a card?

01:04:26.410 --> 01:04:29.500
I'm telling you, it's not a prank call!

01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:31.000
I really know Lee Gon...

01:04:33.550 --> 01:04:35.840
I mean, the King... I know the King.

01:04:36.340 --> 01:04:38.380
Okay? I'm an acquaintance.

01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:39.590
I...

01:04:44.310 --> 01:04:45.850
I'm really serious.

01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:49.020
I just need to talk to him for one minute.

01:04:52.730 --> 01:04:56.110
I'm short of 2,600 won,

01:04:56.940 --> 01:04:59.570
so I can't return to Busan right now.

01:05:04.910 --> 01:05:05.870
Just ten seconds.

01:05:05.950 --> 01:05:08.500
Please, just ten seconds. I...

01:05:16.050 --> 01:05:16.920
Who

01:05:18.510 --> 01:05:20.220
did you say it was just now?

01:05:21.510 --> 01:05:22.470
Well, Your Majesty,

01:05:23.100 --> 01:05:25.600
some woman called
the Royal Court's main number

01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:27.680
seventeen times, asking for you.

01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:30.480
-The security team was checking--
-No,

01:05:31.690 --> 01:05:33.360
I mean the name of the caller.

01:05:34.690 --> 01:05:36.940
Well, she said she was Princess Diana.

01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:39.990
They tracked her location just in case,
and she's at Seoul Station.

01:05:42.530 --> 01:05:43.450
Turn the helicopter.

01:05:44.370 --> 01:05:45.490
We're going to Seoul.

01:05:46.410 --> 01:05:47.490
Pardon?

01:05:47.580 --> 01:05:50.370
Check Captain Jo's location right now.

01:05:50.460 --> 01:05:51.370
Yes, Your Majesty.

01:06:13.690 --> 01:06:14.610
Oh, my gosh.

01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:18.320
What are you doing here?

01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:19.940
I received orders from the King.

01:06:20.940 --> 01:06:22.990
He said you must be kept alive
until your beheading.

01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:29.660
But do you even really behead people here?

01:06:30.290 --> 01:06:33.250
It hasn't happened since 1920, but...

01:06:35.210 --> 01:06:37.000
it seems like it could happen again soon.

01:06:37.090 --> 01:06:38.340
My gosh.

01:06:40.630 --> 01:06:41.880
Who are you, really?

01:06:42.420 --> 01:06:43.590
Are you really a detective?

01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:46.600
Why did you go
to the police station earlier?

01:06:48.850 --> 01:06:50.060
Were you following me?

01:06:51.810 --> 01:06:52.640
Follow me.

01:07:43.860 --> 01:07:44.860
I heard you were looking for me.

01:07:46.070 --> 01:07:46.950
Yes.

01:07:47.030 --> 01:07:48.160
Seventeen times.

01:07:49.070 --> 01:07:49.990
Yes.

01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:51.910
I thought you were going to stay in Busan.

01:07:52.450 --> 01:07:53.910
Why did you come so far?

01:07:55.830 --> 01:07:57.540
Did you get to find Ahn Bong-hui?

01:07:57.830 --> 01:07:58.830
How did you know?

01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:04.090
Since when were you following me?

01:08:04.260 --> 01:08:06.470
You should have lent me money
if you were there all along.

01:08:08.090 --> 01:08:09.010
Who is she?

01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:12.260
Who are you looking for in this world?

01:08:16.850 --> 01:08:17.980
My mom.

01:08:20.110 --> 01:08:21.650
If this is a parallel world...

01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:25.360
And since Na-ri and Eun-sup are both here,

01:08:26.990 --> 01:08:29.070
although I might not exist...

01:08:31.330 --> 01:08:32.910
my mother could still be alive.

01:08:34.540 --> 01:08:36.120
I know she is someone else,

01:08:37.830 --> 01:08:39.670
but I didn't want her to be sick
in this world.

01:08:40.750 --> 01:08:43.960
I only have memories of her
from when I was five.

01:08:46.380 --> 01:08:48.090
So I just wanted to watch her from afar.

01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:50.180
That's why I came here.

01:08:52.390 --> 01:08:53.810
You should have told me.

01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:55.930
I was just curious.

01:08:56.980 --> 01:08:58.100
But she wasn't there.

01:08:59.730 --> 01:09:00.600
Anyway...

01:09:00.850 --> 01:09:03.940
I had fun today because of you.

01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:05.940
Is that why you searched for KTX?

01:09:06.570 --> 01:09:08.030
I was wondering what KTX is.

01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:10.820
Search?

01:09:13.330 --> 01:09:14.450
He didn't tell me that.

01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:16.790
The auto-save function told me.

01:09:17.830 --> 01:09:19.830
You were curious about a lot of things.

01:09:20.580 --> 01:09:22.630
Why were you curious about
Lee Gon's ex-girlfriend?

01:09:23.290 --> 01:09:24.710
Didn't you think
that I never had a girlfriend?

01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:29.300
Why would you read that?

01:09:30.010 --> 01:09:30.880
That's cheating.

01:09:33.050 --> 01:09:34.720
Your Majesty, Prime Minister Koo is--

01:09:34.810 --> 01:09:37.350
Right. You looked up
Prime Minister Koo as well.

01:09:37.430 --> 01:09:38.980
That was because...

01:09:39.690 --> 01:09:43.480
Because I heard she was
the youngest female Prime Minister.

01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:46.020
I only looked up her name
because I was amazed by that.

01:09:47.530 --> 01:09:48.940
Why? Do you feel guilty?

01:09:49.030 --> 01:09:50.530
I meet her every Friday.

01:09:52.110 --> 01:09:53.030
Is she IU?

01:10:00.620 --> 01:10:02.000
Yes, it's Prime Minister Koo.

01:10:02.620 --> 01:10:06.040
She probably got a report
that your helicopter landed in Seoul.

01:10:36.070 --> 01:10:38.620
I'm seeing you at an unexpected hour,
in an unexpected place,

01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:41.620
with an unexpected person, Your Majesty.

01:10:42.460 --> 01:10:43.330
You're right.

01:10:43.830 --> 01:10:45.830
And you've put me in an awkward situation.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:48.840
