<b>Yes, sir.</b>

159
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,880
<b>Is Uncle Da-hoon here?</b>

160
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:35,880
<b>Da-hoon went to the market with Hyo-sook.</b>

161
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,680
<b>What brings you here, Seol-a?</b>

162
00:10:37,687 --> 00:10:40,990
<b>I was studying too hard and used my brain too much.</b>

163
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:43,050
<b>I felt dizzy, so I came out.</b>

164
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,875
<b>What were you studying?</b>

165
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:50,645
<b>That is a "T", "T"!</b>

166
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,200
<b>"T"?</b>

167
00:10:52,201 --> 00:10:54,430
<b>I can count up to nine.</b>

168
00:10:54,437 --> 00:10:55,770
<b>I also learned how to read.</b>

169
00:10:55,772 --> 00:10:58,270
<b>You learned a lot.</b>

170
00:10:58,274 --> 00:11:01,710
<b>There's always the right timing to learn.</b>

171
00:11:01,711 --> 00:11:03,680
<b>You came here to brag about that, didn't you?</b>

172
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,650
<b>I came over to ask for a warm cup of hot chocolate.</b>

173
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:10,720
<b>I'll serve up that warm cup of hot chocolate for you.</b>

174
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,820
<b>Thank you for your kindness.</b>

175
00:11:12,822 --> 00:11:15,735
<b>Goodness, look at your manners.</b>

176
00:11:17,026 --> 00:11:19,890
<b>I wish Hyo-sook was as nice as you.</b>

177
00:11:19,896 --> 00:11:23,130
<b>I spoiled her too much when she was young,</b>

178
00:11:23,132 --> 00:11:25,115
<b>and she's a brat now.</b>

179
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:33,855
<b>Here's your warm cup of hot chocolate.</b>

180
00:11:34,343 --> 00:11:37,780
<b>Seol-a, are you interested in makeup too?</b>

181
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:41,065
<b>No way, not me.</b>

182
00:11:41,651 --> 00:11:44,420
<b>Primping oneself is nothing to be ashamed of.</b>

183
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,380
<b>One should always have style.</b>

184
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:49,090
<b>Your own style, you know?</b>

185
00:11:49,092 --> 00:11:50,975
<b>"Style"?</b>

186
00:11:53,529 --> 00:11:56,530
<b>Let me see. Seol-a,</b>

187
00:11:56,532 --> 00:11:59,460
<b>would you like to get a makeover today?</b>

188
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:01,730
<b>- Really? [ - Yes. ]</b>

189
00:12:01,738 --> 00:12:03,270
<b>You have no clue</b>

190
00:12:03,272 --> 00:12:06,300
<b>how popular I was back in the good old days.</b>

191
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:08,110
<b>Whenever I showed up at the market,</b>

192
00:12:08,111 --> 00:12:13,595
<b>all the men fell on their backs with nosebleeds.</b>

193
00:12:17,286 --> 00:12:18,780
<b>Goodness, Seol-a!</b>

194
00:12:18,788 --> 00:12:20,550
<b>I was so out of my mind.</b>

195
00:12:20,556 --> 00:12:21,650
<b>Seol-a,</b>

196
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:24,320
<b>if you wait just a bit, Hyo-sook will show up soon.</b>

197
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:26,260
<b>Can you stay put until she comes?</b>

198
00:12:26,262 --> 00:12:27,730
<b>[ Sure, I'll see you later. ]</b>

199
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,230
<b>Okay, thanks.</b>

200
00:12:29,232 --> 00:12:32,045
<b>Goodness, I'm so out of my mind.</b>

201
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:44,125
<b>So this is the style of idol stars?</b>

202
00:12:50,086 --> 00:12:52,835
<b>Gosh, what are you?</b>

203
00:12:53,222 --> 00:12:54,805
<b>What?</b>

204
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:59,105
<b>My mom's such a trouble maker.</b>

205
00:13:09,405 --> 00:13:12,300
<b>Seol-a, what's wrong with your face?</b>

206
00:13:12,308 --> 00:13:14,210
<b>Who did this to you?</b>

207
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,570
<b>And what's up with your hair?</b>

208
00:13:16,579 --> 00:13:17,940
<b>Who made you like this?</b>

209
00:13:17,947 --> 00:13:19,080
<b>Stop it!</b>

210
00:13:19,081 --> 00:13:22,350
<b>I'm going to get back at that old lady.</b>

211
00:13:22,351 --> 00:13:24,565
<b>I'm going to take revenge.</b>

212
00:13:29,091 --> 00:13:30,805
<b>[ Seol-a. ]</b>

213
00:13:30,993 --> 00:13:32,460
<b>Hello.</b>

214
00:13:32,461 --> 00:13:35,245
<b>Yes, hello, how polite you are.</b>

215
00:13:35,665 --> 00:13:38,745
<b>By the way, what happened to your hair?</b>

216
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:42,330
<b>The Teahouse lady did this to me.</b>

217
00:13:42,338 --> 00:13:45,185
<b>I'm so embarrassed.</b>

218
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:47,310
<b>It was Ms. Byung-chun, right?</b>

219
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:49,610
<b>She ruined many</b>

220
00:13:49,612 --> 00:13:51,180
<b>with her "style" talk.</b>

221
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:54,195
<b>I had no clue.</b>

222
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:56,050
<b>I'm going to take revenge.</b>

223
00:13:56,052 --> 00:13:58,620
<b>Goodness, it's okay.</b>

224
00:13:58,621 --> 00:14:01,150
<b>That's how you learn about life.</b>

225
00:14:01,157 --> 00:14:02,990
<b>Time will cure it all.</b>

226
00:14:02,992 --> 00:14:05,220
<b>How can time cure it all?</b>

227
00:14:05,228 --> 00:14:07,230
<b>I'm just going to go to Byeol-na</b>

228
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:08,730
<b>and ask for another makeover.</b>

229
00:14:08,731 --> 00:14:10,260
<b>Stop!</b>

230
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,660
<b>Wait.</b>

231
00:14:11,667 --> 00:14:15,730
<b>I'm telling you this since you're now old enough</b>

232
00:14:15,738 --> 00:14:17,300
<b>to become reasonable.</b>

233
00:14:17,306 --> 00:14:20,685
<b>Excuse me? What does that mean?</b>

234
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,970
<b>Look.</b>

235
00:14:22,979 --> 00:14:26,810
<b>Do you know what's most important in life?</b>

236
00:14:26,816 --> 00:14:28,550
<b>Having a nice friend around you.</b>

237
00:14:28,551 --> 00:14:31,980
<b>Basically, you need to meet the right people.</b>

238
00:14:31,988 --> 00:14:33,820
<b>Take me as an example.</b>

239
00:14:33,823 --> 00:14:36,150
<b>I thought the Hwang family was a noble family.</b>

240
00:14:36,158 --> 00:14:37,860
<b>So I married Hwang Jang-dan</b>

241
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,005
<b>but look at my miserable life now.</b>

242
00:14:40,329 --> 00:14:42,945
<b>I'm sharing this only to you.</b>

243
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,630
<b>Stay far away from Byeol-na as much as you can.</b>

244
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:50,270
<b>Why? I like Byeol-na.</b>

245
00:14:50,273 --> 00:14:53,910
<b>This isn't about liking or disliking someone.</b>

246
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:57,010
<b>What I'm talking about is one's background.</b>

247
00:14:57,013 --> 00:14:58,480
<b>Whatever.</b>

248
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:00,140
<b>I'm going to hang out with Byeol-na.</b>

249
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,150
<b>She's fun to hang out with.</b>

250
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:05,020
<b>Goodness, you're unbelievable.</b>

251
00:15:05,021 --> 00:15:07,320
<b>I really didn't want to say this,</b>

252
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,835
<b>but I have no choice.</b>

253
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:13,775
<b>Byeol-na was a beggar in Australia.</b>

254
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:16,230
<b>You know what that is, right?</b>

255
00:15:16,232 --> 00:15:18,700
<b>It's someone who has nothing.</b>

256
00:15:18,701 --> 00:15:21,170
<b>She had nothing to eat and rummaged through garbage</b>

257
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,470
<b>to find food with rats.</b>

258
00:15:22,471 --> 00:15:24,140
<b>She slept under newspapers.</b>

259
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,700
<b>If you hang out with Byeol-na,</b>

260
00:15:26,709 --> 00:15:28,840
<b>you might end up like her too.</b>

261
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:30,725
<b>Do you see what I mean?</b>

262
00:15:36,485 --> 00:15:40,135
<b>Rice cakes, rice cakes on sale.</b>

263
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,220
<b>Rice cakes on sale.</b>

264
00:15:42,224 --> 00:15:44,160
<b>Rice cakes on sale!</b>

265
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,275
<b>Rice cakes on sale.</b>

266
00:15:58,741 --> 00:16:01,555
<b>Oh, Dad.</b>

267
00:16:03,913 --> 00:16:05,510
<b>"Dad"?</b>

268
00:16:05,514 --> 00:16:07,495
<b>I'm sorry,</b>

269
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:10,250
<b>but I never had such a tiny beggar</b>

270
00:16:10,252 --> 00:16:12,535
<b>as a daughter.</b>

271
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,320
<b>No, this isn't right.</b>

272
00:16:19,328 --> 00:16:22,145
<b>[ This is wrong. ]</b>

273
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,415
<b>Seol-a!</b>

274
00:16:34,443 --> 00:16:36,610
<b>Hi, Byeol-na. Goodness.</b>

275
00:16:36,612 --> 00:16:37,810
<b>Bye.</b>

276
00:16:37,813 --> 00:16:40,595
<b>Seol-a! Where are you going?</b>

277
00:16:43,152 --> 00:16:45,335
<b>[ Seol-a, wait up! ]</b>

278
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,235
<b>Wait for me!</b>

279
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,405
<b>Seol-a!</b>

280
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,875
<b>Hey!</b>

281
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:02,585
<b>[ Wait for me! ]</b>

282
00:17:04,407 --> 00:17:06,885
<b>Hey!</b>

283
00:17:15,484 --> 00:17:18,020
<b>Stop following me.</b>

284
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,820
<b>Where are you going?</b>

285
00:17:19,822 --> 00:17:21,590
<b>What's going on?</b>

286
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:24,505
<b>I'm not going to hang out with you anymore.</b>

287
00:17:25,194 --> 00:17:26,705
<b>Why?</b>

288
00:17:28,664 --> 00:17:31,660
<b>Ms. Pi heard this from my dad.</b>

289
00:17:31,667 --> 00:17:33,030
<b>It's a solid fact!</b>

290
00:17:33,035 --> 00:17:34,715
<b>What is a solid fact?</b>

291
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:36,570
<b>Anyway, if I hang out with you,</b>

292
00:17:36,572 --> 00:17:39,200
<b>I would be like you. That's what she said. I can't.</b>

293
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:42,110
<b>"Like me"? What does that mean?</b>

294
00:17:42,111 --> 00:17:44,380
<b>I won't hang out with you.</b>

295
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,010
<b>So tell me! Why?</b>

296
00:17:46,015 --> 00:17:48,280
<b>What do you mean by that?</b>

297
00:17:48,284 --> 00:17:51,835
<b>You're an Australian beggar!</b>

298
00:17:55,925 --> 00:18:01,445
<b>[ Beggar! ]</b>

299
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:05,945
<b>[ Beggar! ]</b>

300
00:18:07,636 --> 00:18:09,730
<b>[ Did you see me? ]</b>

301
00:18:09,738 --> 00:18:13,740
<b>Beggar? And not just a regular beggar, but an Australian beggar?</b>

302
00:18:13,742 --> 00:18:15,210
<b>Well...</b>

303
00:18:15,211 --> 00:18:18,995
<b>I don't think you can cook with such poor imagination.</b>

304
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:21,965
<b>Which is probably why you are stuck in the countryside like this.</b>

305
00:18:22,418 --> 00:18:24,320
<b>You're not only talking down but talking trash now.</b>

306
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,420
<b>It's not your place to say that. You're the one talking trash about me.</b>

307
00:18:27,423 --> 00:18:30,250
<b>You talk nonsense because you're jealous of my friendship with your daughter...</b>

308
00:18:30,259 --> 00:18:32,590
<b>She's not my daughter! Jealous, my foot!</b>

309
00:18:32,595 --> 00:18:35,330
<b>And what? "Nonsense"?</b>

310
00:18:35,331 --> 00:18:36,760
<b>Of course it's nonsense.</b>

311
00:18:36,765 --> 00:18:40,300
<b>Show me the proof. If you don't have any, I will sue you.</b>

312
00:18:40,302 --> 00:18:43,130
<b>This is defamation.</b>

313
00:18:43,139 --> 00:18:44,440
<b>What else is it?</b>

314
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,840

00:59:30,450 --> 00:59:32,450
<b>Let me go. Byeol-na is in there.</b>

938
00:59:32,452 --> 00:59:36,120
<b>What do you mean? How do you know?</b>

939
00:59:36,122 --> 00:59:38,890
<b>- You can't go in! - Why would this hairpin be here?</b>

940
00:59:38,892 --> 00:59:40,590
<b>You're right.</b>

941
00:59:40,594 --> 00:59:42,505
<b>Can Byeol-na really be in there?</b>

942
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:09,335
<b>Byeol-na!</b>

<b>- Seung-mo! - Chef Moon!</b>

<b>[ - It's a scary world indeed. ] - Byeol-na!</b>

947
01:00:41,021 --> 01:00:44,150
<b>How dare they kidnap someone in broad daylight?</b>

948
01:00:44,157 --> 01:00:46,050
<b>[ We become murderers if we get caught, right? ]</b>

949
01:00:46,059 --> 01:00:48,490
<b>Nonsense. We won't get caught.</b>

950
01:00:48,495 --> 01:00:51,545
<b>You have to take what you want.</b>

951

<b>There's nothing wrong with that.</b>

952

<b>- Did you find the kidnapper? - What kidnapper?</b>

953

<b>[ We're going all "CSI" on this. ]</b>

954

<b>[ - So who did Bella take from? - What? ]</b>

955
01:01:01,708 --> 01:01:04,610
<b>I was taught that you have to take what you want.</b>

956
01:01:04,611 --> 01:01:05,810
<b>[ The culprit has been caught? ]</b>

<b>[ You know Donghan, the big company in Seoul! ]</b>

958
01:01:08,782 --> 01:01:11,050
<b>- Byeol-na! - A black van came</b>

959
01:01:11,051 --> 01:01:12,450
<b>and took me...</b>

960
