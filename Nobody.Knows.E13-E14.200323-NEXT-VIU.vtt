(Please be aware of any unpleasant or unsettling content.)

00:00:22.218 --> 00:00:23.293
Over here!

00:00:49.622 --> 00:00:52.536
(Episode 7)

00:00:55.632 --> 00:00:59.176
I should check with the hospital for his bag.

00:01:00.702 --> 00:01:01.877
Just a moment.

00:01:07.241 --> 00:01:08.842
This man.

00:01:08.842 --> 00:01:10.486
I know him.

00:01:11.512 --> 00:01:12.587
Who is it?

00:01:14.581 --> 00:01:16.227
He's from the church.

00:01:16.822 --> 00:01:19.197
- New Life Church? - Yes.

00:01:20.251 --> 00:01:22.236
But I don't remember his name though.

00:01:22.521 --> 00:01:23.736
What's important is that...

00:01:25.191 --> 00:01:26.406
he and Seo Sang Won...

00:01:29.161 --> 00:01:31.346
used to be like brothers.

00:01:35.872 --> 00:01:38.486
(Eun Ho)

00:01:40.072 --> 00:01:41.216
Yes?

00:01:43.982 --> 00:01:45.126
Hello?

00:01:57.361 --> 00:01:58.766
Eun Ho.

00:01:58.962 --> 00:02:00.106
Ko Eun Ho.

00:02:06.131 --> 00:02:07.747
If I had answered on that day...

00:02:08.102 --> 00:02:09.716
She might've lived.

00:02:11.572 --> 00:02:13.686
My original target was you,

00:02:13.811 --> 00:02:16.816
but I went after your friend since you didn't fit the criteria.

00:02:16.982 --> 00:02:18.057
Eun Ho...

00:02:19.681 --> 00:02:21.121
is still alive.

00:02:21.121 --> 00:02:24.166
He'll soon die though just like Choi Su Jung.

00:02:24.792 --> 00:02:27.196
He'll have died because of you too.

00:02:28.091 --> 00:02:29.696
Because of me?

00:02:30.931 --> 00:02:32.006
Detective?

00:02:33.061 --> 00:02:34.177
Detective Cha.

00:02:36.132 --> 00:02:37.207
Are you all right?

00:02:40.072 --> 00:02:41.172
I'm fine.

00:02:41.172 --> 00:02:42.247
Detective,

00:02:42.472 --> 00:02:44.946
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

00:02:45.341 --> 00:02:47.916
The drawing in Eun Ho's notebook and the person he saved.

00:02:48.711 --> 00:02:50.527
They were both related to Seo Sang Won.

00:02:50.681 --> 00:02:54.196
How is this even possible? And why do we keep...

00:02:55.482 --> 00:02:56.827
finding traces...

00:02:57.621 --> 00:02:59.966
of Seo Sang Won near Eun Ho?

00:03:00.891 --> 00:03:01.966
What if...

00:03:03.361 --> 00:03:05.767
none of this was a coincidence?

00:03:07.662 --> 00:03:08.906
What if...

00:03:11.331 --> 00:03:12.547
What if...

00:03:20.542 --> 00:03:22.617
(Eun Ho's caregiver)

00:03:25.512 --> 00:03:26.827
Should I answer that instead?

00:03:32.252 --> 00:03:33.527
Cha Young Jin speaking.

00:03:34.922 --> 00:03:36.036
Yes.

00:03:37.732 --> 00:03:38.906
Is he conscious?

00:03:40.602 --> 00:03:41.936
I'll be right there.

00:03:45.532 --> 00:03:47.916
What is it? What did he say?

00:03:48.371 --> 00:03:49.476
Eun Ho...

00:03:51.711 --> 00:03:53.247
Eun Ho woke up.

00:04:13.391 --> 00:04:14.476
Detective Cha.

00:04:15.032 --> 00:04:17.347
You had me thinking that it was bad news.

00:04:18.301 --> 00:04:20.646
If it's good news,

00:04:21.201 --> 00:04:23.576
you should say it with a smile on your face.

00:04:23.912 --> 00:04:26.717
"Eun Ho woke up."

00:04:27.482 --> 00:04:28.557
Like this.

00:04:51.272 --> 00:04:52.376
Sir, it's Tae Hyung.

00:04:53.131 --> 00:04:54.617
I don't think you need to come.

00:04:55.301 --> 00:04:57.177
- A minimally conscious state? - Yes.

00:04:57.342 --> 00:05:00.217
Every time he hears something, he wakes up and falls back to sleep.

00:05:01.741 --> 00:05:02.917
So that means...

00:05:03.381 --> 00:05:05.727
he woke up because his body reacted to a stimulus.

00:05:05.852 --> 00:05:08.352
- Yes. - You must be busy, Tae Hyung.

00:05:08.352 --> 00:05:10.597
No, I'm fine. I'll continue to keep an eye on him.

00:05:11.022 --> 00:05:12.097
Okay, bye.

00:05:18.532 --> 00:05:19.706
No way.

00:05:22.431 --> 00:05:23.537
Could he have heard something?

00:05:33.241 --> 00:05:35.256
(Caregiver Kim Tae Hyung)

00:06:40.611 --> 00:06:41.717
So Yeon.

00:06:42.441 --> 00:06:44.386
I'm sorry about everything.

00:06:45.652 --> 00:06:49.526
I even once thought about...

00:06:50.321 --> 00:06:51.626
becoming Eun Ho's dad.

00:06:52.621 --> 00:06:57.467
I thought Eun Ho was naive and kind.

00:06:59.131 --> 00:07:02.076
But I realized that he was...

00:07:03.301 --> 00:07:05.206
too much for me.

00:07:06.032 --> 00:07:07.576
I mean it in a good way.

00:07:08.672 --> 00:07:10.117
So Yeon.

00:07:10.301 --> 00:07:11.487
Eun Ho...

00:07:11.811 --> 00:07:13.247
is the best thing...

00:07:15.441 --> 00:07:16.857
that ever happened to you.

00:07:36.032 --> 00:07:39.677
(Caregiver Kim Tae Hyung)

00:07:44.712 --> 00:07:46.186
Hey, Tae Hyung.

00:07:49.642 --> 00:07:51.186
Eun Ho woke up?

00:07:52.381 --> 00:07:54.927
My goodness gracious.

00:07:55.681 --> 00:07:57.227
Okay, I'll be right there.

00:08:03.422 --> 00:08:04.566
Eun Ho.

00:08:04.662 --> 00:08:09.037
You probably need to yell at him...

00:08:09.301 --> 00:08:11.047
to get him to wake up.

00:08:17.042 --> 00:08:19.516
Eun Ho, take it easy.

00:08:19.941 --> 00:08:21.086
Your teacher and I...

00:08:23.611 --> 00:08:26.857
are taking one step at a time...

00:08:27.212 --> 00:08:28.497
to find out what happened.

00:08:29.951 --> 00:08:31.696
I'm going to find out what you wanted to say,

00:08:32.022 --> 00:08:34.766
what you couldn't tell me,

00:08:35.591 --> 00:08:38.067
and even the stuff that you didn't even know.

00:09:02.821 --> 00:09:06.467
Sun Kyung, it's me. I have a question.

00:09:06.622 --> 00:09:09.690
- What is it? - Remember the guy...

00:09:09.691 --> 00:09:13.431
that used to be like brothers with Seo Sang Won...

00:09:13.431 --> 00:09:14.707
back when we were young at the church?

00:09:15.731 --> 00:09:17.006
Mr. Jang Ki Ho?

00:09:17.632 --> 00:09:19.207
Right. Jang Ki Ho.

00:09:20.032 --> 00:09:21.772
Why do you ask all of a sudden?

00:09:21.772 --> 00:09:24.742
I saw him from far away.

00:09:24.742 --> 00:09:26.847
And I wasn't sure if it was him.

00:09:27.042 --> 00:09:30.256
Sun Kyung, my friend is calling me.

00:09:30.282 --> 00:09:31.386
I'll talk to you later.

00:09:35.321 --> 00:09:36.756
Yes, that's right. His name was Jang Ki Ho.

00:09:40.492 --> 00:09:42.937
Why did Sun Woo ask you about Jang Ki Ho?

00:09:43.162 --> 00:09:45.666
I don't know. He apparently saw him somewhere.

00:10:00.042 --> 00:10:03.286
The self-government committee decided to be lenient.

00:10:03.512 --> 00:10:05.711
He just needs to write an apology letter to the victim...

00:10:05.711 --> 00:10:07.957
and move to another class.

00:10:08.221 --> 00:10:09.926
I'm going to get sent to a different class?

00:10:10.321 --> 00:10:12.392
- Yes. - Did you agree to this?

00:10:12.392 --> 00:10:14.051
If it weren't for your homeroom teacher,

00:10:14.051 --> 00:10:15.837
you would've had to transfer schools.

00:10:15.862 --> 00:10:17.067
Did you agree to this?

00:10:18.061 --> 00:10:19.166
Yes.

00:10:20.032 --> 00:10:21.176
What's the matter with you?

00:10:24.301 --> 00:10:25.376
Hey.

00:10:25.831 --> 00:10:27.331
What's wrong with you? Hey!

00:10:27.331 --> 00:10:29.876
- Hey! - Calm down!

00:10:31.071 --> 00:10:33.847
Do you think this is a circus? Get lost!

00:10:34.581 --> 00:10:35.817
Call a teacher.

00:10:35.981 --> 00:10:37.727
Out of the way! Move!

00:10:38.681 --> 00:10:39.786
Tae Hyung!

00:10:43.051 --> 00:10:44.126
Put that down.

00:10:55.431 --> 00:10:56.776
What do you think you're doing?

00:10:59.071 --> 00:11:01.376
- Go to the infirmary. - Jae Bin.

00:11:02.542 --> 00:11:05.717
Don't you think you deserve to get beaten up a bit more?

00:11:06.872 --> 00:11:09.156
- Tae Hyung. - I really didn't do anything...

00:11:10.142 --> 00:11:12.687
to deserve to get punished because of him.

00:11:13.752 --> 00:11:15.227
So if I'm going to get punished anyway,

00:11:17.051 --> 00:11:18.367
I might as well just do something to him.

00:11:23.762 --> 00:11:24.862
Hey!

00:11:24.862 --> 00:11:26.561
- Mr. Lee, are you okay? - Sir, are you okay?

00:11:26.561 --> 00:11:28.862
- Sir, you're bleeding. - Mr. Lee, are you okay?

00:11:28.862 --> 00:11:30.032
- Mr. Lee. - My gosh.

00:11:30.032 --> 00:11:31.672
Call an ambulance!

00:11:31.672 --> 00:11:34.071
- Mr. Lee! - Mr. Lee, are you okay?

00:11:34.071 --> 00:11:35.146
Are you okay?

00:11:51.591 --> 00:11:53.666
You called her first?

00:11:53.752 --> 00:11:56.197
No, I called you first.

00:11:56.292 --> 00:11:58.731
I kept calling you, but you didn't answer my calls.

00:11:58.731 --> 00:11:59.867
From now on,

00:12:00.591 --> 00:12:02.806
I don't want you to call her regarding stuff like this.

00:12:03.601 --> 00:12:06.607
- Okay. - And please stop coming here.

00:12:06.902 --> 00:12:09.217
Eun Ho's getting better, and you're busy.

00:12:09.571 --> 00:12:10.646
No, I'm fine.

00:12:13.642 --> 00:12:15.556
I'm not fine with it!

00:12:16.542 --> 00:12:18.126
You make me feel uncomfortable!

00:12:20.652 --> 00:12:23.497
Eun Ho and I have been friends for seven years.

00:12:24.652 --> 00:12:27.227
I care about how he's doing and wish to know if he's okay.

00:12:27.351 --> 00:12:28.796
"Friends"?

00:12:29.862 --> 00:12:33.437
You're over 20 years older than him. How can you be friends?

00:12:33.632 --> 00:12:35.276
Let's be honest.

00:12:35.831 --> 00:12:38.506
You're using him to feel superior over me.

00:12:39.032 --> 00:12:41.341
"I'm a better adult. I can't believe she's his mother."

00:12:41.341 --> 00:12:43.817
Isn't that what you think to yourself?

00:12:44.002 --> 00:12:45.447
If I were his mom.

00:12:45.612 --> 00:12:47.841
If Eun Ho were my son. Right?

00:12:47.841 --> 00:12:50.217
Why? Why do you have such thoughts?

00:12:51.282 --> 00:12:52.351
Stop.

00:12:52.351 --> 00:12:54.327
Let go. Let go of me.

00:12:54.922 --> 00:12:56.026
Let me go.

00:12:57.922 --> 00:12:59.997
Let go. Let me go.

00:13:00.221 --> 00:13:02.337
Don't touch me!

00:13:10.762 --> 00:13:13.347
I don't care what you say to me.

00:13:14.801 --> 00:13:17.077
Because you are nobody to me.

00:13:17.971 --> 00:13:20.117
You can never hurt me.

00:13:20.941 --> 00:13:23.016
But when you're around your son,

00:13:23.841 --> 00:13:25.156
watch your language.

00:13:25.912 --> 00:13:27.587
Because you're a mother.

00:13:28.622 --> 00:13:31.926
Your harsh words hurt Eun Ho.

00:13:33.792 --> 00:13:36.567
Not even the kindest, sweetest person in the world...

00:13:37.492 --> 00:13:38.636
can...

00:13:39.331 --> 00:13:41.107
replace you for him.

00:14:08.922 --> 00:14:10.097
How come?

00:14:10.922 --> 00:14:12.506
How is Tae Hyung here?

00:14:19.471 --> 00:14:20.632
(Baek Sang Ho)

00:14:20.632 --> 00:14:21.747
(Calling Baek Sang Ho)

00:14:27.112 --> 00:14:28.311
(Lee Sun Woo)

00:14:28.311 --> 00:14:30.487
(Power off)

00:14:35.382 --> 00:14:37.756
The call cannot be connected.

00:14:44.992 --> 00:14:46.367
(Off Limits)

00:15:09.081 --> 00:15:10.156
Let's go.

00:15:11.591 --> 00:15:13.396
How is the kid?

00:15:14.091 --> 00:15:16.867
He has to stay longer. How about this guy?

00:15:17.321 --> 00:15:20.132
Like you said, one of Kevin Jung's legs...

00:15:20.132 --> 00:15:22.477
I crushed it completely.

00:15:23.032 --> 00:15:26.847
Good. That way it's even.

00:15:27.032 --> 00:15:28.447
Shall I have a look?

00:16:19.252 --> 00:16:20.367
Hey.

00:16:23.262 --> 00:16:26.492
I'll get those things out of your mouths.

00:16:26.492 --> 00:16:29.276
But I hate listening, so you just answer.

00:16:29.301 --> 00:16:30.477
Okay?

00:16:38.042 --> 00:16:41.247
Spare my life! I'll do anything you want!

00:16:42.412 --> 00:16:44.016
Let's just kill them both.

00:16:44.081 --> 00:16:45.851
You're heartless.

00:16:45.851 --> 00:16:48.581
Take pity on this kid. He does as he's told.

00:16:48.581 --> 00:16:51.992
This happened because that idiot told him...

00:16:51.992 --> 00:16:53.422
to bring the goods to our hotel.

00:16:53.422 --> 00:16:55.561
It'll be easier to wrap things up if we kill them both.

00:16:55.561 --> 00:16:56.697
That's true though.

00:16:57.061 --> 00:16:58.207
What shall we do?

00:16:58.532 --> 00:16:59.737
Kill them both?

00:17:04.802 --> 00:17:06.306
The deity sometimes...

00:17:06.832 --> 00:17:09.142
wakes us up with a punishment,

00:17:09.142 --> 00:17:11.342
and placates us with a blessing.

00:17:11.342 --> 00:17:12.447
But...

00:17:12.711 --> 00:17:15.417
he also remains silent.

00:17:15.582 --> 00:17:17.481
He gives us the free will to choose...

00:17:17.481 --> 00:17:19.511
because he respects us that much.

00:17:19.511 --> 00:17:21.082
Have you ever had...

00:17:21.082 --> 00:17:24.082
a privilege greater than being able to choose?

00:17:24.082 --> 00:17:26.052
Choosing where to get your degree,

00:17:26.052 --> 00:17:28.592
choosing where to work or whom you marry.

00:17:28.592 --> 00:17:30.397
Not things like that.

00:17:30.791 --> 00:17:33.707
Choosing something that can change your life completely.

00:17:33.931 --> 00:17:35.006
Which can also...

00:17:37.562 --> 00:17:41.677
ruin someone else's life completely.

00:17:46.541 --> 00:17:48.511
The Millennium Hotel is my home.

00:17:48.511 --> 00:17:50.157
You can't make it yours...

00:17:50.312 --> 00:17:52.387
and disrespect the homeowner.

00:17:52.451 --> 00:17:55.627
I don't care if you deal drugs,

00:17:56.981 --> 00:17:58.997
but if you did it in my home...

00:18:02.622 --> 00:18:03.997
Then it's different.

00:18:07.362 --> 00:18:08.477
Mr. Oh?

00:18:17.102 --> 00:18:18.887
Okay, I'll spare you.

00:18:19.041 --> 00:18:20.687
Just one of you.

00:18:21.142 --> 00:18:23.457
But I'll give both of you a choice.

00:18:24.852 --> 00:18:27.127
So, take a look...

00:18:28.021 --> 00:18:29.127
and pick one.

00:18:29.481 --> 00:18:31.826
Please spare my life!

00:18:31.951 --> 00:18:33.967
Please don't kill me!

00:18:35.922 --> 00:18:37.066
No?

00:18:37.862 --> 00:18:40.167
You won't pick?

00:18:40.392 --> 00:18:41.531
Then I'm out too.

00:18:41.531 --> 00:18:43.231
We'll kill you both like they said.

00:18:43.231 --> 00:18:45.647
- Kill them then join me. - Okay.

00:18:45.832 --> 00:18:48.877
An ax! An ax!

00:18:49.302 --> 00:18:50.417
No.

00:18:51.441 --> 00:18:55.417
A hammer! A hammer! Give me a hammer.

00:19:00.152 --> 00:19:01.457
What a nice pick.

00:19:01.652 --> 00:19:04.157
I picked it, so why...

00:19:04.281 --> 00:19:06.167
Can't you just listen?

00:19:14.902 --> 00:19:16.606
Darn it. Untie them.

00:19:23.402 --> 00:19:24.747
Now it's my turn.

00:19:25.342 --> 00:19:27.447
I'll choose one of you.

00:19:28.142 --> 00:19:29.217
Okay?

00:19:29.312 --> 00:19:32.356
Pick that up faster than the other...

00:19:32.511 --> 00:19:36.026
and pound the other with it relentlessly.

00:19:38.052 --> 00:19:39.566
That's the deal.

00:19:40.392 --> 00:19:41.536
Okay?

00:19:41.991 --> 00:19:43.066
Ready?

00:19:45.531 --> 00:19:46.667
Go.

00:19:52.531 --> 00:19:54.506
Don't believe him! It's a lie!

00:19:56.001 --> 00:19:59.147
He'll have us both killed anyway.

00:19:59.672 --> 00:20:00.987
So what?

00:20:01.211 --> 00:20:02.687
We should both die?

00:20:03.741 --> 00:20:05.387
We must fight back together.

00:20:19.632 --> 00:20:22.336
You choose to die together?

00:20:24.001 --> 00:20:26.346
Okay. Then I'll tell you this.

00:20:26.431 --> 00:20:27.576
At first,

00:20:28.941 --> 00:20:31.241
I was going to kill Lee Young Sik.

00:20:31.241 --> 00:20:34.812
But what he told me about you...

00:20:34.812 --> 00:20:36.241
changed my mind.

00:20:36.241 --> 00:20:38.227
You didn't know that, did you?

00:20:38.781 --> 00:20:39.852
You didn't know.

00:20:39.852 --> 00:20:43.127
No, no. It's not true.

00:20:53.162 --> 00:20:54.407
My gosh.

00:21:09.011 --> 00:21:10.516
I killed him.

00:21:10.612 --> 00:21:12.627
Will you spare me?

00:21:15.251 --> 00:21:16.950
I should keep my word.

00:21:16.951 --> 00:21:18.266
Thank you.

00:21:18.652 --> 00:21:19.927
Thank you.

00:21:23.221 --> 00:21:24.296
But...

00:21:27.761 --> 00:21:29.477
I don't think it's over yet.

00:21:50.382 --> 00:21:52.096
(From Detective Cha Young Jin. Where are you?)

00:22:18.882 --> 00:22:20.457
Why are you out here?

00:22:22.281 --> 00:22:23.627
Just because.

00:22:24.052 --> 00:22:25.526
His mother's inside.

00:22:27.021 --> 00:22:29.467
So is his caregiver.

00:22:30.122 --> 00:22:31.191
The doctor said...

00:22:31.191 --> 00:22:34.167
he won't have a physical disability.

00:22:35.132 --> 00:22:36.536
That's such a relief.

00:22:36.862 --> 00:22:39.707
Like Baek Sang Ho said, it's a miracle.

00:22:40.971 --> 00:22:43.200
He dropped from a 10-story building,

00:22:43.201 --> 00:22:44.846
but he lived.

00:22:45.812 --> 00:22:47.286
And there will be no permanent damage.

00:22:48.112 --> 00:22:51.657
Is this even possible though?

00:22:54.412 --> 00:22:55.526
Think about it.

00:22:56.082 --> 00:22:57.997
The rooftop was at the height of a 10-story building.

00:22:58.052 --> 00:23:00.791
If he had dropped from there,

00:23:00.791 --> 00:23:02.721
the impact...

00:23:02.721 --> 00:23:05.066
would've been like colliding with a car at 100km per hour.

00:23:06.132 --> 00:23:08.931
Even though the car beneath him absorbed the impact...

00:23:08.931 --> 00:23:10.606
That's what we call a miracle.

00:23:11.971 --> 00:23:13.046
A miracle.

00:23:15.501 --> 00:23:16.747
I guess you can say that.

00:23:22.741 --> 00:23:24.316
You seem exhausted.

00:23:26.251 --> 00:23:29.096
Do you get enough sleep? Don't tell me you're skipping meals.

00:23:31.181 --> 00:23:32.326
I get by.

00:23:34.991 --> 00:23:37.761
- How about some dinner? - I'll grab a bite.

00:23:37.761 --> 00:23:39.036
I meant, with me.

00:23:42.461 --> 00:23:43.737
I have something to tell you anyway.

00:23:45.471 --> 00:23:47.147
The man Eun Ho saved.

00:23:48.817 --> 00:23:50.392
I found out his name.

00:23:55.441 --> 00:23:56.657
Tell me right now.

00:23:57.312 --> 00:23:58.582
I will once you finish that.

00:23:58.582 --> 00:24:01.086
- I have other ways to find out. - I know.

00:24:02.322 --> 00:24:06.096
You're a detective of the Special Crime Squad...

00:24:06.322 --> 00:24:07.927
who leads a homicide team.

00:24:08.491 --> 00:24:11.467
Still, finishing that bowl of gukbab...

00:24:11.592 --> 00:24:13.766
seems like the easiest way.

00:24:25.292 --> 00:24:27.496
His name is Jang Ki Ho.

00:24:27.971 --> 00:24:29.086
His age?

00:24:30.112 --> 00:24:33.427
I'm guessing he's in his late 40s or early 50s.

00:24:34.681 --> 00:24:37.652
My sister would've been suspicious had I asked her his age.

00:24:37.652 --> 00:24:38.991
All your family members...

00:24:38.991 --> 00:24:40.352
must be congregants of the New Life Church.

00:24:40.352 --> 00:24:41.427
Well,

00:24:41.791 --> 00:24:44.667
I guess you can say that about us.

00:24:44.761 --> 00:24:45.866
You too?

00:24:45.931 --> 00:24:48.066
I never missed church when I was young,

00:24:48.531 --> 00:24:51.677
but then I had to be dragged there after hitting puberty.

00:24:52.572 --> 00:24:55.541
I never stepped foot into the place after my father passed away though.

00:24:55.541 --> 00:24:59.316
Then you don't have any recent information on Jang Ki Ho.

00:24:59.441 --> 00:25:00.586
That's right.

00:25:00.812 --> 00:25:02.756
I couldn't even remember his name.

00:25:09.822 --> 00:25:11.457
You must be thinking...

00:25:13.291 --> 00:25:15.766
that what happened to Eun Ho wasn't a coincidence.

00:25:18.892 --> 00:25:22.477
There's a reason for it, but you can't tell me.

00:25:23.162 --> 00:25:24.437
Thank you for today.

00:25:25.271 --> 00:25:28.970
Eun Ho's prize you brought me produced new leads.

00:25:28.971 --> 00:25:30.147
We should head out.

00:25:30.672 --> 00:25:31.816
I also...

00:25:33.041 --> 00:25:34.316
haven't told you everything.

00:25:35.342 --> 00:25:38.217
There are things I can't speak about yet,

00:25:40.382 --> 00:25:42.227
but I wish I could someday.

00:25:43.251 --> 00:25:45.366
Just like how you didn't tell me about Dong Myung?

00:25:49.162 --> 00:25:50.296
Yes.

00:25:52.791 --> 00:25:53.862
Are you heading home?

00:25:53.862 --> 00:25:56.530
No, to the hospital Jang Ki Ho was taken to.

00:25:56.531 --> 00:26:00.006
I'll head back to school and check the CCTV footage from the next day.

00:26:00.501 --> 00:26:02.172
If I see Eun Ho's bag,

00:26:02.172 --> 00:26:05.616
then it'll mean that it missing has nothing to do with Jang Ki Ho.

00:26:07.271 --> 00:26:08.487
Thank you in advance then.

00:26:13.082 --> 00:26:18.627
(Seoyeon University Emergency Medical Center)

00:26:32.501 --> 00:26:35.006
Did he put something in his bag?

00:26:36.072 --> 00:26:37.147
Or maybe he took something out.

00:26:42.011 --> 00:26:43.157
Yes, Mr. Lee.

00:26:43.882 --> 00:26:45.627
I checked the camera footage.

00:26:46.281 --> 00:26:48.552
Eun Ho was spotted leaving school the next day...

00:26:48.552 --> 00:26:50.451
with his backpack.

00:26:50.451 --> 00:26:53.497
I saw him with the other bag the next morning.

00:26:53.951 --> 00:26:56.362
Then his backpack went missing...

00:26:56.362 --> 00:26:58.036
the day after he saved Jang Ki Ho.

00:27:00.461 --> 00:27:03.536
And that evening, he came to see me...

00:27:08.642 --> 00:27:09.776
But...

00:27:11.041 --> 00:27:13.546
I just told him to go home.

00:27:14.842 --> 00:27:15.882
You didn't know.

00:27:15.882 --> 00:27:18.056
I knew that he wasn't his usual self.

00:27:21.951 --> 00:27:23.296
I chose to ignore it.

00:27:57.352 --> 00:27:58.382
Yes?

00:27:58.382 --> 00:28:00.326
The light in your apartment is on.

00:28:02.662 --> 00:28:05.197
I must've forgot since I was in a hurry.

00:28:05.491 --> 00:28:07.437
Could you go in and turn it off?

00:28:08.018 --> 00:28:09.202
You know the lock combination.

00:28:10.461 --> 00:28:11.576
Sure thing.

00:29:26.211 --> 00:29:28.516
- Hello? - That's enough.

00:29:29.082 --> 00:29:30.356
When did you get home?

00:29:31.541 --> 00:29:34.026
- About an hour ago. - That was before me.

00:29:34.312 --> 00:29:36.427
- Did you have dinner? - Not yet.

00:29:38.052 --> 00:29:41.596
I want some ramyeon, but there aren't any at home.

00:29:42.461 --> 00:29:44.997
- Are there any at my place? - Four packets.

00:29:46.261 --> 00:29:47.336
Come on up then.

00:30:20.191 --> 00:30:22.036
Could Im Hee Jung be the accomplice?

00:30:22.332 --> 00:30:25.177
What if they shared this big secret, but he killed her...

00:30:25.201 --> 00:30:26.707
due to a disagreement?

00:30:30.342 --> 00:30:33.086
Do you still not know about the connection they had?

00:30:33.112 --> 00:30:36.642
They were close associates of Pastor Kwon Jae Chun,

00:30:36.642 --> 00:30:38.556
the founder of our church.

00:30:58.201 --> 00:31:01.546
He and Seo Sang Won used to be like brothers.

00:31:16.994 --> 00:31:20.679
Are you sure you're here to ask about Jang Ki Ho?

00:31:21.063 --> 00:31:22.208
Yes.

00:31:22.633 --> 00:31:23.903
I doubt it.

00:31:23.903 --> 00:31:25.408
What do you mean?

00:31:26.203 --> 00:31:29.173
Should I know something else that isn't related to Mr. Jang?

00:31:29.173 --> 00:31:31.818
So you're really here to ask about him?

00:31:32.144 --> 00:31:33.784
- Yes. - That's odd.

00:31:33.784 --> 00:31:36.789
Then were those men not the real police?

00:31:37.513 --> 00:31:38.553
I don't think I follow.

00:31:38.553 --> 00:31:39.628
Hold on.

00:31:42.454 --> 00:31:46.069
Kim Byung Hee of Homicide Team One.

00:31:50.994 --> 00:31:52.064
He's a member of my team.

00:31:52.064 --> 00:31:54.564
So he wasn't impersonating a police officer then.

00:31:54.564 --> 00:31:56.709
Anyway, the detectives came by...

00:31:57.004 --> 00:31:59.009
and asked about Mr. Jang.

00:31:59.174 --> 00:32:01.004
What did they ask you about?

00:32:01.004 --> 00:32:05.219
They were here to check the rumors of him being missing.

00:32:06.043 --> 00:32:08.158
Jang Ki Ho is missing?

00:32:09.413 --> 00:32:11.128
I like the serenity around here.

00:32:11.454 --> 00:32:13.124
- Sir. - Would you like a cup of coffee?

00:32:13.124 --> 00:32:14.999
I already had one with the boss.

00:32:15.254 --> 00:32:17.369
He wants us to quickly wrap up the stigmata serial murder case.

00:32:17.624 --> 00:32:18.654
When can you wrap things up?

00:32:18.654 --> 00:32:20.424
The culprit confessed and died.

00:32:20.424 --> 00:32:22.669
So we can wrap it up right now if we want.

00:32:22.993 --> 00:32:24.238
But isn't that a bit too quick?

00:32:24.264 --> 00:32:26.364
Did the church pull some strings?

00:32:26.364 --> 00:32:28.663
We all think that, but don't say it out loud.

00:32:28.663 --> 00:32:29.704
Hurry up and get to work.

00:32:29.704 --> 00:32:32.743
Shouldn't you inform Ms. Cha of this?

00:32:32.743 --> 00:32:35.119
I'll tell her myself. Just hurry up and wrap it up.

00:32:36.174 --> 00:32:37.318
There she is.

00:32:37.544 --> 00:32:39.518
- Hello. - Good morning.

00:32:43.883 --> 00:32:45.114
What? Do you have something to say?

00:32:45.114 --> 00:32:46.559
Im Hee Jung's close acquaintance,

00:32:47.284 --> 00:32:48.859
Jang Ki Ho, went missing.

00:32:49.254 --> 00:32:51.369
- What do you mean? - Why didn't you report to me?

00:32:51.394 --> 00:32:53.669
He went missing a few days before the accident.

00:32:54.264 --> 00:32:56.064
And there were no call records between him and Seo Sang Won.

00:32:56.064 --> 00:32:57.993
So we figured he had nothing to do with the stigmata serial murders.

00:32:57.993 --> 00:33:00.633
Plus, the culprit confessed everything and killed himself.

00:33:00.633 --> 00:33:01.908
What more can we do?

00:33:02.004 --> 00:33:03.333
Are you kidding me?

00:33:03.333 --> 00:33:05.943
You still should've reported that to me.

00:33:05.943 --> 00:33:07.119
I told you so.

00:33:08.404 --> 00:33:09.548
I'm sorry, sir.

00:33:11.144 --> 00:33:13.258
Did Jae Hong tell you about Jang Ki Ho?

00:33:17.014 --> 00:33:18.429
Detective Lee also knows?

00:33:39.373 --> 00:33:41.743
Why didn't you wake me up? It's my turn to take over.

00:33:41.743 --> 00:33:43.089
I wasn't tired.

00:33:48.283 --> 00:33:50.788
You didn't drink any water so you won't have to go to the bathroom?

00:33:51.253 --> 00:33:52.388
No.

00:33:52.583 --> 00:33:53.758
Officer Yun.

00:33:55.824 --> 00:33:58.469
We're colleagues, not competitors.

00:34:01.424 --> 00:34:03.568
I want to take your place.

00:34:06.264 --> 00:34:07.439
My gosh.

00:34:15.474 --> 00:34:16.788
Hey, Detective Park.

00:34:17.114 --> 00:34:19.358
Do you still have nothing new regarding Kevin Jung?

00:34:20.044 --> 00:34:21.158
No.

00:34:21.243 --> 00:34:24.089
- Then come back to the office. - What?

00:34:24.984 --> 00:34:26.929
- Remember Jang Ki Ho? - Yes.

00:34:28.724 --> 00:34:30.628
Ms. Cha found out about him.

00:34:35.963 --> 00:34:37.493
Choi Dae Hoon was apparently murdered.

00:34:37.493 --> 00:34:39.963
Kevin Jung and Lee Young Sik suddenly went missing.

00:34:39.963 --> 00:34:42.803
And now, Jang Ki Ho even has something to do with Ko Eun Ho.

00:34:42.803 --> 00:34:45.203
Why is that punk involved with everyone?

00:34:45.204 --> 00:34:46.303
Sir, I apologize for saying this.

00:34:46.303 --> 00:34:48.318
But it makes me feel uneasy to hear you...

00:34:48.574 --> 00:34:50.212
talk about the victim that way.

00:34:50.213 --> 00:34:52.144
Hey, you punk. I was just being comfortable...

00:34:52.144 --> 00:34:54.644
Even if you're right, it makes people feel uneasy...

00:34:54.644 --> 00:34:57.114
if you talk back like that to your superior.

00:34:57.114 --> 00:35:00.424
Gosh, you're the one who always talks back to Ms. Cha.

00:35:00.424 --> 00:35:01.499
That's enough.

00:35:02.753 --> 00:35:05.894
Do you think he helped Seo Sang Won?

00:35:05.894 --> 00:35:07.839
Who? Jang Ki Ho?

00:35:09.694 --> 00:35:10.769
Why do you think that?

00:35:10.993 --> 00:35:13.364
Seo Sang Won had your name card.

00:35:13.364 --> 00:35:16.279
And he even sent you the video of the murder.

00:35:16.604 --> 00:35:18.508
That means he had his eyes on you for a while.

00:35:18.734 --> 00:35:20.944
Then he surely would've known about Eun Ho.

00:35:20.944 --> 00:35:23.414
So maybe Jang Ki Ho approached Eun Ho on purpose.

00:35:23.414 --> 00:35:25.373
Gosh, that's so far-stretched.

00:35:25.373 --> 00:35:27.789
So you think he faked his heart attack to approach him?

00:35:27.844 --> 00:35:31.229
Plus, Eun Ho fell from the hotel after Seo Sang Won died.

00:35:31.383 --> 00:35:32.698
And Choi Dae Hoon was the culprit.

00:35:32.984 --> 00:35:34.953
I should've thought it through. I'm sorry.

00:35:34.953 --> 00:35:38.169
I want all the files regarding the stigmata serial murders.

00:35:38.753 --> 00:35:39.869
Ms. Cha.

00:35:39.993 --> 00:35:42.933
We were told to wrap this case up as soon as possible.

00:35:42.933 --> 00:35:44.164
That's not going to happen.

00:35:44.164 --> 00:35:45.939
Then what do you want me to do?

00:35:46.263 --> 00:35:48.263
Plus, you promised to take your hands off the case.

00:35:48.263 --> 00:35:50.508
I'm in charge of both the stigmata murder case and Eun Ho's accident.

00:35:50.604 --> 00:35:52.278
I'll investigate both cases myself.

00:35:52.433 --> 00:35:54.044
And I'll take responsibility...

00:35:54.044 --> 00:35:55.643
for all the consequences.

00:35:55.643 --> 00:35:59.088
You're doing it again! Again!

00:36:07.284 --> 00:36:10.398
I want all of you to do your best to find Jang Ki Ho.

00:36:10.724 --> 00:36:11.799
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

00:36:13.323 --> 00:36:15.239
You'd better take responsibility.

00:36:15.724 --> 00:36:18.008
And let me know if you need a larger budget.

00:36:20.104 --> 00:36:21.939
You pay for the budget!

00:36:45.354 --> 00:36:46.568
Aren't you going to ask...

00:36:47.063 --> 00:36:49.193
if we took care of it properly?

00:36:49.193 --> 00:36:50.309
If things didn't go well,

00:36:51.664 --> 00:36:53.878
Hee Dong and Du Seok will take responsibility.

00:36:53.904 --> 00:36:55.409
Don't you think you trust us too much?

00:36:55.664 --> 00:36:57.479
Why do you think I saved you guys?

00:36:58.373 --> 00:37:01.378
I'm never wrong about people. You guys will never abandon me.

00:37:06.114 --> 00:37:07.714
How many times have we gone through something like this...

00:37:07.714 --> 00:37:09.018
because of a kid?

00:37:09.354 --> 00:37:11.614
Plus, Yun Hee Seob found out that Ko Eun Ho...

00:37:11.614 --> 00:37:12.898
saved Jang Ki Ho.

00:37:13.154 --> 00:37:14.823
What if Yun Hee Seob finds him before we do?

00:37:14.823 --> 00:37:17.453
Tell him to go ahead. We're after different things anyway.

00:37:17.453 --> 00:37:19.939
What if Jang Ki Ho tells him the secret?

00:37:20.924 --> 00:37:22.369
In order to do that,

00:37:23.294 --> 00:37:25.334
Eun Ho will have to give back...

00:37:25.334 --> 00:37:26.739
what he got from Jang Ki Ho.

00:38:28.224 --> 00:38:30.008
she was very rich.

Do you have something to say?

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

00:41:48.763 --> 00:41:51.108

00:41:54.064 --> 00:41:55.379
apologizing to?

00:41:57.003 --> 00:41:59.718
I know this makes no sense.

00:42:00.074 --> 00:42:01.779
- But was it Seo Sang Won? - No.

00:42:04.543 --> 00:42:06.988
That's what you've been wondering?

00:42:09.013 --> 00:42:10.559
- I'm sorry. - It's okay.

00:42:10.783 --> 00:42:13.728
I just told you not to hide anything from me.

No.

00:42:37.944 --> 00:42:40.714
I deserved a scolding, but you got me off the hook.

00:42:40.714 --> 00:42:42.159
What do you mean?

00:42:42.243 --> 00:42:43.929
It's nothing.

00:42:46.954 --> 00:42:48.929
Officer Yun filled me in.

00:42:51.094 --> 00:42:55.068
Continuous coincidences feel like an inevitability.

00:42:55.824 --> 00:42:57.663
During my career in the police,

00:42:57.663 --> 00:43:01.003
I saw and experienced all sorts of cases.

00:43:01.003 --> 00:43:02.279
If there's a possibility,

00:43:02.934 --> 00:43:06.643
there's nothing in the world that cannot happen.

00:43:06.643 --> 00:43:08.743
Are you saying that Eun Ho meeting Jang Ki Ho...

00:43:08.743 --> 00:43:10.413
was a coincidence?

00:43:10.413 --> 00:43:13.383
I'm saying you should act with an answer in your head.

00:43:13.383 --> 00:43:16.084
You said Seo Sang Won must have had an accomplice.

00:43:16.084 --> 00:43:18.328
In your mind, that accomplice...

00:43:18.984 --> 00:43:21.728
is Jang Ki Ho, isn't it?

00:43:24.293 --> 00:43:25.529
Young Jin.

00:43:26.464 --> 00:43:28.868
Who is it that you're chasing?

00:43:29.423 --> 00:43:32.568
The accomplice of Seo Sang Won whom you think killed Su Jung?

00:43:32.964 --> 00:43:35.263
Or the accomplice of Choi Dae Hoon...

00:43:35.263 --> 00:43:36.679
who almost killed Eun Ho?

00:43:46.444 --> 00:43:47.984
What if they're the same person?

00:43:47.984 --> 00:43:51.159
Even if Jang Ki Ho's involved in both cases,

00:43:51.714 --> 00:43:54.259
depending on whether you want to...

00:43:54.753 --> 00:43:56.998
solve Su Jung's case or Eun Ho's...

00:43:57.423 --> 00:43:59.228
should determine what you do next.

00:44:06.864 --> 00:44:08.009
Eun Ho's case.

00:44:11.133 --> 00:44:13.049
Eun Ho wouldn't have known...

00:44:13.543 --> 00:44:16.588
what was happening when he was abducted and fell.

00:44:19.173 --> 00:44:20.858
I promised him.

00:44:21.844 --> 00:44:24.659
That I'd find out what even he didn't know.

00:44:25.854 --> 00:44:27.498
Let's find the connection...

00:44:27.954 --> 00:44:30.598
between Choi Dae Hoon and Jang Ki Ho first.

00:44:33.663 --> 00:44:34.769
Okay.

00:44:36.293 --> 00:44:38.009
Where will you go now?

00:44:39.033 --> 00:44:40.379
To Shinsung Middle School.

00:44:40.564 --> 00:44:42.238
I'll start with Ha Min Sung.

00:44:45.334 --> 00:44:47.974
Is it true that you saw Jang Ki Ho yesterday?

00:44:47.974 --> 00:44:49.318
Did Sun Kyung tell you?

00:44:49.844 --> 00:44:52.389
No. I was next to her when you called.

00:44:52.474 --> 00:44:54.019
Where did you see him?

00:44:54.783 --> 00:44:56.588
From surveillance camera footage on an ambulance.

00:44:57.054 --> 00:44:58.653
- What? - I found the person...

00:44:58.653 --> 00:45:00.523
Eun Ho saved by doing CPR.

00:45:00.523 --> 00:45:02.228
I recognized his face.

00:45:02.484 --> 00:45:04.098
But I couldn't remember his name.

00:45:04.724 --> 00:45:06.054
So I asked Sun Kyung.

00:45:06.054 --> 00:45:08.098
Why were you looking for...

00:45:08.793 --> 00:45:10.909
the person that boy saved?

00:45:11.893 --> 00:45:14.179
Sun Woo, what are you getting up to?

00:45:15.434 --> 00:45:16.649
Well...

00:45:17.403 --> 00:45:20.019
I don't know what I'm doing nowadays.

00:45:20.903 --> 00:45:22.748
I should just ignore it all.

00:45:26.714 --> 00:45:28.559
Thanks for the tea.

00:45:32.253 --> 00:45:33.328
Sun Woo.

00:45:33.954 --> 00:45:35.029
What?

00:45:35.684 --> 00:45:37.228
About Min Sung.

00:45:38.253 --> 00:45:39.698
Let me deal with it.

00:46:05.354 --> 00:46:07.198
(Baek Sang Ho)

00:46:10.653 --> 00:46:11.694
Hi.

00:46:11.694 --> 00:46:13.763
Sorry for not picking up yesterday.

00:46:13.763 --> 00:46:15.939
I was busy with something else.

00:46:16.763 --> 00:46:17.868
It's fine.

00:46:18.234 --> 00:46:20.009
Why did you call me?

00:46:21.234 --> 00:46:23.848
I just called when I was visiting Eun Ho.

00:46:23.934 --> 00:46:25.179
Did you?

00:46:25.804 --> 00:46:27.574
- What about class? - I'm free right now.

00:46:27.574 --> 00:46:29.204
Then shall we have a chat?

00:46:29.204 --> 00:46:30.588
I'm at the school.

00:46:33.043 --> 00:46:34.118
Where?

00:46:44.354 --> 00:46:47.338
Hey! Mr. Lee Sun Woo!

00:46:48.493 --> 00:46:50.108
Hello, sir.

00:46:51.094 --> 00:46:52.893
You're here. Oh, sorry.

00:46:52.893 --> 00:46:55.838
I'm here. This is your turf.

00:46:58.574 --> 00:46:59.633
Why are you here?

00:46:59.633 --> 00:47:01.618
I wanted to discuss something.

00:47:01.974 --> 00:47:03.078
With me?

00:47:04.773 --> 00:47:06.919
- Is it about Eun Ho? - No.

00:47:07.484 --> 00:47:08.559
Dong Myung.

00:47:12.854 --> 00:47:14.629
You know he saved someone, right?

00:47:14.954 --> 00:47:16.769
That person asked me for a favor.

00:47:16.793 --> 00:47:19.423
He wants to meet Eun Ho and thank him in person.

00:47:19.423 --> 00:47:21.769
Tell him to call this number.

00:47:38.844 --> 00:47:39.948
Thank you.

00:47:40.484 --> 00:47:43.584
I heard you're paying for Dong Myung's brother's surgery.

00:47:43.584 --> 00:47:47.159
My job is to help and save poor kids.

00:47:47.253 --> 00:47:50.324
My foundation's thinking of sponsoring...

00:47:50.324 --> 00:47:51.893
a one-to-one mentoring program.

00:47:51.893 --> 00:47:53.493
We want to try it out here first.

00:47:53.493 --> 00:47:55.564
I called you here to discuss that.

00:47:55.564 --> 00:47:57.393
Shouldn't you discuss that with the chairman...

00:47:57.393 --> 00:48:00.708
The seniors who overcame hardships when they were young...

00:48:01.003 --> 00:48:03.163
support the youth who are having a rough time...

00:48:03.163 --> 00:48:04.574
as mentors.

00:48:04.574 --> 00:48:05.948
Doesn't that sound nice?

00:48:06.104 --> 00:48:08.403
Oh, and I'd like Ju Dong Myung...

00:48:08.403 --> 00:48:10.619
to be the first one to be mentored.

00:48:11.943 --> 00:48:14.244
His brother Han Sol said this.

00:48:14.244 --> 00:48:15.319
He's so happy...

00:48:16.614 --> 00:48:18.728
that he has his brother.

00:48:19.314 --> 00:48:23.329
His brother is his dad, mom, and friend.

00:48:24.324 --> 00:48:25.528
He wishes that...

00:48:27.123 --> 00:48:29.564
his brother had an older brother.

00:48:29.564 --> 00:48:31.409
That kid...

00:48:33.864 --> 00:48:36.708
I'll match him up with the guy who's caring for Eun Ho.

00:48:36.834 --> 00:48:38.548
He's a nice guy.

00:48:41.074 --> 00:48:43.379
"Instead of being angry with me,"

00:48:43.514 --> 00:48:45.919
"he always gave me a warm smile."

00:48:46.213 --> 00:48:47.943
"I looked at him..."

00:48:47.943 --> 00:48:50.589
"and thought that if I could have a dad..."

00:48:55.284 --> 00:48:57.223
"I thought I would want..."

00:48:57.223 --> 00:48:59.768
"someone like Doctor Katz to be my dad."

00:49:01.024 --> 00:49:02.123
("The Life Before Us")

00:49:02.123 --> 00:49:04.839
Eun Ho. Do you really enjoy this book?

00:49:05.433 --> 00:49:07.139
Shall I read you something more fun?

00:49:08.864 --> 00:49:10.478
Do you know him well?

00:49:10.504 --> 00:49:11.649
Tae Hyung?

00:49:11.873 --> 00:49:13.334
Yes, I do.

00:49:13.334 --> 00:49:15.518
He works for my foundation.

00:49:16.044 --> 00:49:17.248
He's a nice kid.

00:49:17.473 --> 00:49:20.689
You can trust him with Eun Ho and Dong Myung.

00:49:21.314 --> 00:49:23.683
Well, at first, he was so hostile...

00:49:23.683 --> 00:49:26.058
and just couldn't trust people.

00:49:26.183 --> 00:49:27.429
Until then,

00:49:27.854 --> 00:49:30.869
everyone had hurt or betrayed him.

00:49:31.354 --> 00:49:33.468
But he changed after he met us.

00:49:34.163 --> 00:49:36.538
He's a good guy. And he's reliable.

00:49:43.264 --> 00:49:44.609
Do you feel unwell?

00:49:45.104 --> 00:49:46.548
Why are you so pale?

00:49:47.373 --> 00:49:48.478
Tae Hyung.

00:49:50.873 --> 00:49:52.448
He was in my class.

00:49:53.044 --> 00:49:54.189
Really?

00:49:56.044 --> 00:49:58.458
What a coincidence.

00:49:58.713 --> 00:50:01.629
Eun Ho is in your class, and so was Tae Hyung?

00:50:01.883 --> 00:50:03.929
Was it in his second year of high school?

00:50:04.193 --> 00:50:06.528
He said he quit school because of his teacher.

00:50:08.364 --> 00:50:09.639
That was me.

00:50:13.733 --> 00:50:14.839
Yesterday,

00:50:16.064 --> 00:50:17.808
when I visited Eun Ho,

00:50:19.004 --> 00:50:20.478
I met Tae Hyung.

00:50:21.443 --> 00:50:24.589
I thought of that time and just hid.

00:50:26.443 --> 00:50:30.018
That is proof that you're a good person.

00:50:30.413 --> 00:50:33.483
Each person has different depths of shame and conscience.

00:50:33.483 --> 00:50:36.129
Some have none at all.

00:50:36.453 --> 00:50:37.723
When you do wrong,

00:50:37.723 --> 00:50:39.824
you never forget it easily.

00:50:39.824 --> 00:50:41.623
If a similar situation arises,

00:50:41.623 --> 00:50:44.069
you'll try to make a different choice.

00:50:44.163 --> 00:50:45.433
Look at you now.

00:50:45.433 --> 00:50:47.403
You rushed all over the place...

00:50:47.403 --> 00:50:49.478
for Dong Myung who isn't even in your class.

00:50:53.133 --> 00:50:54.319
I want you to...

00:50:55.143 --> 00:50:58.014
take over the Shinsung Foundation as chair soon.

00:50:58.014 --> 00:50:59.643
Why would you say that?

00:50:59.643 --> 00:51:02.143
If it's with you, Sun Woo,

00:51:02.143 --> 00:51:03.788
New Life Foundation...

00:51:04.183 --> 00:51:05.689
and Shinsung Foundation...

00:51:06.183 --> 00:51:08.298
could gather our forces...

00:51:08.883 --> 00:51:10.159
for the kids.

00:51:11.494 --> 00:51:14.669
I think we could do something no one has done before.

00:51:15.163 --> 00:51:16.298
Don't you think?

00:51:23.433 --> 00:51:24.579
Ha Min Sung.

00:51:32.244 --> 00:51:33.589
Let's talk.

00:51:34.213 --> 00:51:35.319
About what?

00:51:36.084 --> 00:51:38.689
What could you and I have to talk about?

00:51:42.123 --> 00:51:43.329
Other than Eun Ho.

00:51:57.703 --> 00:51:59.349
(Contacts)

00:51:59.574 --> 00:52:00.718
(Mr. Lee Sun Woo)

00:52:02.274 --> 00:52:03.748
Since we're both here,

00:52:04.574 --> 00:52:06.689
can I have a chat with Dong Myung?

00:52:14.423 --> 00:52:16.599
I'll ask him first.

00:52:17.754 --> 00:52:18.829
What?

00:52:22.364 --> 00:52:23.768
Yes, of course.

00:52:27.334 --> 00:52:28.439
- Can you excuse me? - Go ahead.

00:52:30.004 --> 00:52:31.109
Yes, Detective Cha.

00:52:40.713 --> 00:52:41.819
Detective.

00:52:42.584 --> 00:52:43.988
Well, this is a surprise.

00:52:45.784 --> 00:52:47.423
I wasn't expecting you here today.

00:52:47.423 --> 00:52:48.683
I'm here to see Min Sung.

00:52:48.683 --> 00:52:50.298
Mr. Lee!

00:52:50.554 --> 00:52:51.854
Mr. Lee, Ju Dong Myung...

00:52:51.854 --> 00:52:54.399
He dragged Ha Min Sung away like this.

00:52:54.564 --> 00:52:56.439
- Where? - The science lab.

00:52:57.794 --> 00:52:58.869
Let's go.

00:53:02.034 --> 00:53:04.109
(Science Lab)

00:53:08.244 --> 00:53:10.218
I was questioned by detectives...

00:53:11.114 --> 00:53:12.448
regarding Eun Ho's fall.

00:53:13.473 --> 00:53:16.614
Eun Ho fell? From where?

00:53:16.614 --> 00:53:18.558
Don't you play dumb with me.

00:53:18.854 --> 00:53:21.498
I know you ordered your driver to do it!

00:53:23.554 --> 00:53:26.369
Did you make him take Eun Ho to the rooftop to scare him?

00:53:26.653 --> 00:53:28.268
Or did you order him to push Eun Ho?

00:53:28.324 --> 00:53:29.439
You're insane.

00:53:30.163 --> 00:53:31.264
What is this nonsense?

00:53:31.264 --> 00:53:34.079
The detectives showed me a photo of your driver.

00:53:34.764 --> 00:53:36.478
Is he in a holding cell?

00:53:36.903 --> 00:53:39.609
How long do you think he'll keep quiet for you?

00:53:41.104 --> 00:53:42.179
Eun Ho said...

00:53:43.574 --> 00:53:46.119
that he was the one making your life harder.

00:53:48.284 --> 00:53:49.488
Is that why...

00:53:50.913 --> 00:53:51.988
you did this?

00:53:56.983 --> 00:54:00.268
Didn't Eun Ho jump because of you?

00:54:02.094 --> 00:54:04.339
- What? - You were stealing money from him.

00:54:04.594 --> 00:54:05.939
I saw it many times.

00:54:07.163 --> 00:54:09.008
I would've wanted to jump...

00:54:10.373 --> 00:54:12.548
if a hobo like you had stolen my money too.

00:54:23.084 --> 00:54:24.514
- Move. - Out of the way!

00:54:24.514 --> 00:54:25.629
Over there.

00:54:40.604 --> 00:54:41.679
Min Sung.

00:54:44.133 --> 00:54:45.248
Dong Myung.

00:54:46.534 --> 00:54:47.718
Why did you do this?

00:54:50.973 --> 00:54:52.718
Dong Myung didn't do this.

00:54:55.744 --> 00:54:58.758
Min Sung, look at me.

00:55:02.923 --> 00:55:05.968
Mr. Lee, let's take him to the hospital.

00:55:07.364 --> 00:55:08.498
Dong Myung, come with us.

00:55:10.594 --> 00:55:12.569
Kids, out of the way.

00:55:15.064 --> 00:55:16.208
Min Sung?

00:55:16.233 --> 00:55:18.448
Guys, go back to your classes.

00:55:19.403 --> 00:55:20.518
Move.

00:55:21.544 --> 00:55:23.919
Hurry. Get moving.

00:55:24.443 --> 00:55:25.589
Come here.

00:55:27.544 --> 00:55:28.758
And who may you be?

00:55:30.453 --> 00:55:31.659
I'm the police.

00:55:32.883 --> 00:55:34.183
Rank and team?

00:55:34.183 --> 00:55:35.653
I am Inspector Cha Young Jin...

00:55:35.653 --> 00:55:37.123
of Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency's...

00:55:37.123 --> 00:55:38.929
Special Crime Squad Homicide Team One.

00:55:40.623 --> 00:55:43.693
Mr. Lee, take Min Sung to the hospital.

00:55:43.693 --> 00:55:45.069
- Sir. - Right now.

00:55:46.393 --> 00:55:47.738
A student is hurt.

00:55:50.433 --> 00:55:51.679
Go with Mr. Lee.

00:56:09.623 --> 00:56:11.294
- Was it you again? - Sir.

00:56:11.294 --> 00:56:12.429
Please leave.

00:56:12.723 --> 00:56:15.094
The school isn't open to anyone.

00:56:15.094 --> 00:56:17.334
I was let in by Mr. Lee.

00:56:17.334 --> 00:56:20.008
Then I'll hear the details from him.

00:56:20.264 --> 00:56:21.933
- Now, please leave. - I'm a police officer.

00:56:21.933 --> 00:56:24.473
I can't leave when I have stumbled on an incident.

00:56:24.473 --> 00:56:26.349
Then I'll call campus security.

00:56:29.443 --> 00:56:32.544
No. Dong Myung is a key witness in a case...

00:56:32.544 --> 00:56:34.258
we are currently investigating.

00:56:34.913 --> 00:56:36.359
He comes with me.

00:56:38.584 --> 00:56:41.683
Is this really a case for the Special Crime Squad?

00:56:41.683 --> 00:56:43.429
Women and Children's Department will take the case.

00:56:44.393 --> 00:56:46.069
Then let's ask Dong Myung.

00:56:47.824 --> 00:56:50.298
Dong Myung, which would you rather choose?

00:56:52.094 --> 00:56:53.308
What you said before...

00:56:54.903 --> 00:56:56.179
Did you mean it?

00:56:57.633 --> 00:56:58.748
Yes.

00:57:02.844 --> 00:57:04.349
I'll go with the detective.

00:57:07.913 --> 00:57:09.889
Then please look out for him.

00:57:40.014 --> 00:57:42.919
You're still on school grounds even though Mr. Lee isn't.

00:57:43.044 --> 00:57:44.558
Well,

00:57:45.514 --> 00:57:47.899
two people I wanted to meet are right here.

00:57:49.453 --> 00:57:50.528
Hi.

00:57:59.633 --> 00:58:01.008
I know you.

00:58:01.203 --> 00:58:02.804
I saw you when Eun Ho received his prize.

00:58:02.804 --> 00:58:04.548
So you were there too.

00:58:07.744 --> 00:58:08.849
Thank you...

00:58:09.373 --> 00:58:11.319
for paying for my brother's surgery.

00:58:11.913 --> 00:58:14.589
I'll make sure to pay you back.

00:58:18.514 --> 00:58:20.488
Sure thing. I'll wait.

00:58:24.994 --> 00:58:26.123
Take this.

00:58:26.123 --> 00:58:27.223
(Chairman Baek Sang Ho)

00:58:27.223 --> 00:58:28.339
Thank you.

00:58:32.364 --> 00:58:33.639
We'll get going then.

00:58:34.034 --> 00:58:36.104
Wait, not so fast.

00:58:36.104 --> 00:58:38.879
I'd like to have a word with you, Detective.

00:58:40.673 --> 00:58:43.448
Dong Myung, could you wait outside for me?

00:58:43.744 --> 00:58:44.849
Sure.

00:58:51.814 --> 00:58:53.354
What is it that you want to say?

00:58:53.354 --> 00:58:54.458
Oh, right.

00:58:55.324 --> 00:58:57.754
Are you looking for the lowlifes who committed a crime...

00:58:57.754 --> 00:58:58.893
in my hotel?

00:58:58.893 --> 00:59:00.623
The petty drug dealers?

00:59:00.623 --> 00:59:01.839
That's right.

00:59:01.994 --> 00:59:05.308
You requested my assistance after promising you'd find them,

00:59:06.064 --> 00:59:07.864
but it seems like you're busy with other work.

00:59:07.864 --> 00:59:09.008
We're looking for them.

00:59:09.834 --> 00:59:12.379
If you could only find one,

00:59:12.774 --> 00:59:14.619
which would you choose?

00:59:14.844 --> 00:59:16.104
I don't quite follow.

00:59:16.104 --> 00:59:18.189
I heard something, you see.

00:59:18.744 --> 00:59:21.988
The buyer who lost his money took it out on the seller.

00:59:22.213 --> 00:59:24.854
This happened because the buyer thought...

00:59:24.854 --> 00:59:26.629
it was the seller who took the money.

00:59:28.324 --> 00:59:31.468
And now they're both nowhere to be found.

00:59:31.893 --> 00:59:33.129
Aren't you curious...

00:59:33.524 --> 00:59:35.698
to know what happened between them?

00:59:36.123 --> 00:59:38.369
It sounds like you already know what happened.

00:59:39.834 --> 00:59:43.609
My gosh, of course not.

00:59:43.764 --> 00:59:45.948
I'd love for you to find both of them,

00:59:46.034 --> 00:59:48.673
but which would you rather find...

00:59:48.673 --> 00:59:51.149
if you had to choose?

00:59:51.413 --> 00:59:53.844
Hypothetical or not, I still wouldn't choose.

00:59:53.844 --> 00:59:55.844
Do you have anything more to say?

00:59:55.844 --> 00:59:56.988
You see,

00:59:57.883 --> 00:59:59.359
I'd choose...

01:00:00.413 --> 01:00:02.058
salvation over justice.

01:00:22.703 --> 01:00:23.978
So we meet again.

01:00:25.574 --> 01:00:26.919
Come on in.

01:00:34.223 --> 01:00:36.883
I'd choose...

01:00:36.883 --> 01:00:38.569
salvation over justice.

01:00:39.994 --> 01:00:43.899
Salvation? Which one could he be referring to?

01:00:44.933 --> 01:00:46.669
Look after Dong Myung for me.

01:00:51.633 --> 01:00:54.478
Officer Yun, text me the addresses of Kevin Jung and Lee Young Sik.

01:00:59.774 --> 01:01:01.218
115...

01:02:02.173 --> 01:02:03.448
Mr. Jung?

01:02:27.963 --> 01:02:29.208
Mr. Jung.

01:03:04.233 --> 01:03:05.748
Why does he have that bag?

01:03:31.494 --> 01:03:33.008
("The Life Before Us")

01:03:38.633 --> 01:03:40.149
("The Life Before Us")

01:03:49.183 --> 01:03:54.028
(I can't tell you anything. But can you still help me?)

01:04:18.744 --> 01:04:25.629
(Nobody Knows)

01:04:28.723 --> 01:04:31.094
There weren't any signs of breaking and entering.

01:04:31.094 --> 01:04:33.024
And there weren't any fatal injuries on Kevin Jung's body.

01:04:33.024 --> 01:04:34.824
Then did he die because he overdosed on meth?

01:04:34.824 --> 01:04:36.494
And heroine.

01:04:36.494 --> 01:04:39.064
Why was he holding the kid's bag?

01:04:39.064 --> 01:04:40.669
Do you really think it was Dong Myung?

01:04:40.733 --> 01:04:41.804
What are you talking about?

01:04:41.804 --> 01:04:43.639
You saw what happened.

01:04:45.034 --> 01:04:46.873
Anyone in that situation...

01:04:46.873 --> 01:04:48.804
would've suspected you as the assailant.

01:04:48.804 --> 01:04:50.574
I only invite special people here.

01:04:50.574 --> 01:04:52.614
Eun Ho sometimes asked me for money.

01:04:52.614 --> 01:04:54.344
And he even said some mean stuff to me.

01:04:54.344 --> 01:04:56.988
Min Sung and I still have a chance.

01:04:57.913 --> 01:05:00.488
- Who are you? - What are you doing here?

01:05:01.683 --> 01:05:04.028
You're under arrest for your attempt to murder Lee Sun Woo.
