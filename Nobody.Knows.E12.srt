00:12:49,619 --> 00:12:51,720
<b>Read it for yourself and ask me again.</b>

162
00:12:51,721 --> 00:12:52,720
<b>Yes or no?</b>

163
00:12:52,722 --> 00:12:54,990
<b>No. I can't think of anything.</b>

164
00:12:54,991 --> 00:12:57,145
<b>What is this about?</b>

165
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,285
<b>Though I didn't like it, it was familiar to me.</b>

166
00:13:02,131 --> 00:13:04,795
<b>And yet I think there's so little I know about it.</b>

00:13:23,619 --> 00:13:25,020
<b>this book has great value,</b>

170
00:13:25,021 --> 00:13:27,575
<b>and that is what makes it dangerous.</b>

171

<b>But to those who don't know the secret,</b>

172
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,590
<b>it's just an ordinary book.</b>

173
00:13:32,595 --> 00:13:34,630
<b>That's why you left it with Eun Ho.</b>

174
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:38,260
<b>Because he was good enough to save you and follow you to hospital.</b>

175
00:13:38,267 --> 00:13:41,025
<b>You expected him to say yes despite the hassle.</b>

<b>I'm putting it into words, but I don't get it.</b>

177
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:49,805
<b>How could a person do that?</b>

178
00:13:49,846 --> 00:13:52,210
<b>How could you give something so dangerous...</b>

<b>to the kid who saved your life?</b>

180

<b>That's why I wanted to leave it with him.</b>

181
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:59,475
<b>Because he saved my life.</b>

182
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:01,285
<b>Yes.</b>

183
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,120
<b>Over here!</b>

184
00:14:05,127 --> 00:14:08,085
<b>When I returned from death and opened my eyes,</b>

185
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:11,695
<b>the first thing I saw was his face.</b>

186
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:13,530
<b>The look in his eyes...</b>

187
00:14:13,536 --> 00:14:16,900
<b>caused a ripple in my soul.</b>

188
00:14:16,906 --> 00:14:19,735
<b>Never in my life did I refuse anything,</b>

189
00:14:20,576 --> 00:14:22,540
<b>or make a choice.</b>

190
00:14:22,545 --> 00:14:26,480
<b>I lived according to the will of those better than me.</b>

191
00:14:26,482 --> 00:14:27,945
<b>But...</b>

192
00:14:29,185 --> 00:14:31,480
<b>For some strange reason,</b>

193
00:14:31,487 --> 00:14:36,045
<b>I felt an affection I can't explain from that kid.</b>

194
00:14:36,359 --> 00:14:39,360
<b>Besides, when I found out his name was Eun Ho,</b>

195
00:14:39,362 --> 00:14:42,025
<b>I was reminded of someone who was named...</b>

196
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:45,195
<b>using a syllable of my name.</b>

197
00:14:45,201 --> 00:14:47,455
<b>That was when I made up my mind.</b>

198
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:50,530
<b>The compensation I would gain with that book,</b>

199
00:14:50,539 --> 00:14:52,665
<b>I would share it with that kid.</b>

200
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,640
<b>Long ago,</b>

201
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:58,580
<b>a nameless child was saved from near death.</b>

202
00:14:58,581 --> 00:15:01,005
<b>The pastor named him with...</b>

203
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:03,650
<b>a syllable from my name.</b>

204
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:06,550
<b>Eventually, that child not only took my name,</b>

205
00:15:06,555 --> 00:15:10,415
<b>but he slowly ate away at my rights.</b>

206
00:15:10,459 --> 00:15:12,115
<b>Ki Ho.</b>

207

<b>Sang Ho.</b>

208
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,095
<b>Is that child Baek Sang Ho?</b>

209
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:21,770
<b>Yes.</b>

210
00:15:21,771 --> 00:15:23,365
<b>Baek...</b>

211
00:15:23,539 --> 00:15:25,035
<b>Sang...</b>

212
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:26,970
<b>Ho...</b>

213
00:15:26,976 --> 00:15:29,310
<b>Is the "sang" from Seo Sang Won?</b>

214
00:15:29,312 --> 00:15:30,835
<b>It is.</b>

215
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,575
<b>He took his mother's surname.</b>

216
00:15:34,617 --> 00:15:38,515
<b>Seo Sang Won, Im Hee Jung, Jang Ki Ho, Baek Sang Ho.</b>

217
00:15:38,788 --> 00:15:41,090
<b>You all took your mothers' surnames.</b>

218
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:43,550
<b>The names the pastor gave us are more important to us.</b>

219
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:45,060
<b>Surnames mean nothing.</b>

220
00:15:45,061 --> 00:15:47,115
<b>Do you all...</b>

221
00:15:47,229 --> 00:15:49,185
<b>share the same father?</b>

222
00:15:49,966 --> 00:15:55,565
<b>If so, I have a feeling that is Pastor Kwon Jae Chun. Am I wrong?</b>

223
00:15:56,839 --> 00:16:00,710
<b>I'm the only remaining child of Pastor Kwon's.</b>

224
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,840
<b>Baek Sang Ho isn't Kwon Jae Chun's son?</b>

225
00:16:03,846 --> 00:16:05,810
<b>I just told you.</b>

226
00:16:05,815 --> 00:16:08,010
<b>He was found near death.</b>

227
00:16:08,017 --> 00:16:10,720
<b>He had no name or birth certificate.</b>

228
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,920
<b>His mother had locked him in a room...</b>

229
00:16:12,922 --> 00:16:15,185
<b>and disappeared with the key.</b>

230
00:16:15,358 --> 00:16:18,460
<b>If Pastor Seo hadn't saved him,</b>

231
00:16:18,461 --> 00:16:22,525
<b>he'd have died without leaving a trace on this earth.</b>

232
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:27,865
<b>Do not be afraid.</b>

233
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:32,335
<b>You are a child that I have chosen.</b>

234
00:16:32,508 --> 00:16:35,505
<b>I myself was chosen.</b>

235
00:16:36,345 --> 00:16:38,475
<b>The chosen...</b>

236
00:16:38,681 --> 00:16:40,910
<b>need not fear.</b>

<b>Whatever we do,</b>

238
00:16:42,985 --> 00:16:46,445
<b>we will meet our savior in the end.</b>

239
00:16:46,522 --> 00:16:48,290
<b>Behind you...</b>

240
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:52,785
<b>will always be the deity's blessing.</b>

241
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:56,725
<b>If you're ever in fear,</b>

242
00:16:57,299 --> 00:16:59,825

<b>God is on my side.</b>

244
00:17:06,742 --> 00:17:09,865
<b>I will not be afraid.</b>

245
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,945
<b>What could men do to me?</b>

246
00:17:29,932 --> 00:17:32,295
<b>I guess you overdosed him.</b>

247

<b>Is there something to wake him with?</b>

248

<b>- In the box. - Open it.</b>

249

<b>See?</b>

<b>Until I know that book is real,</b>

<b>The police suspect...</b>

<b>You are one of the many possibilities.</b>

<b>Naturally, he doesn't remember getting your book.</b>

<b>Without proof, the truth has no power.</b>

<b>No.</b>

<b>I never talked about the downside.</b>

00:23:38,801 --> 00:23:40,955
<b>This is the only phone you'll use.</b>

324

<b>I think Cha Young Jin has Jang Ki Ho.</b>

<b>just to meet Eun Ho?</b>

333
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:01,210
<b>Because only the copy he gave to Eun Ho...</b>

334

<b>contains the map.</b>

335

<b>However, Eun Ho still has amnesia.</b>

336
00:25:05,721 --> 00:25:08,290
<b>That means Cha Young Jin hasn't found the book yet.</b>

337
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:12,415
<b>I still have an opportunity to make a choice.</b>

<b>No, the choice must always be mine!</b>

343
00:25:32,581 --> 00:25:34,135

<b>No, and I've been wanting to hear his voice.</b>

<b>with Eun Ho's incident.</b>

<b>Not just about what the doctors can tell me.</b>

373
00:27:26,662 --> 00:27:29,425
<b>I want to know how he's feeling...</b>

374
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:31,800
<b>and ask if he really doesn't remember me.</b>

375
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,200
<b>Should I go instead?</b>

376
00:27:33,201 --> 00:27:34,830
<b>They wouldn't let you in either.</b>

377

<b>I'll take Dong Myung with me.</b>

378

<b>Well, would you?</b>

379
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:44,435
<b>I'm sure that Eun Ho would like to see you...</b>

<b>But I hope that he doesn't remember.</b>

382
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:57,345
<b>If he regains his memory of that day,</b>

383

<b>he'll never be able to forget it again.</b>

384

<b>So what if he doesn't remember me?</b>

385

<b>I don't know.</b>

475
00:34:01,222 --> 00:34:02,520
<b>So what if he is?</b>

476
00:34:02,524 --> 00:34:05,115
<b>Sun Woo, if your sister finds out...</b>

477
00:34:06,694 --> 00:34:08,755
<b>she won't be able to handle it.</b>

<b>You're right.</b>

479
00:34:10,932 --> 00:34:14,455
<b>Once she finds out, she'll kick you to the curb.</b>

<b>Hi, Dong Myung. What's up?</b>

481
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:41,115
<b>I'd like a hall pass.</b>

<b>- To visit Eun Ho? - Yes.</b>

<b>I haven't done it once since leaving the hospital.</b>

<b>Tell me if you get another urge.</b>

<b>- You'll do it for me? - And ruin my life?</b>

<b>So tell me. Who paid for it?</b>

<b>A man spreading good in the world solved our problem.</b>

<b>He keeps asking Dong Myung questions hoping that they'd jog his memory.</b>

548

<b>That means Cha Young Jin...</b>

<b>isn't in possession of the book.</b>

557

<b>It's still too risky.</b>

558

<b>Jang Ki Ho must be killed.</b>

559

<b>Jang Ki Ho will no longer be a threat to us.</b>

561

<b>So what if the man babbles? It hardly qualifies as evidence.</b>

562

<b>Now, what if we had the map but couldn't decipher it?</b>

<b>How frustrating would that be?</b>

<b>It's why we need Jang Ki Ho.</b>

00:44:10,131 --> 00:44:11,960
<b>Say you won't tell anyone.</b>

632
00:44:11,966 --> 00:44:13,525
<b>Please don't do this.</b>

633
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:21,800
<b>Eun Ho, are you okay?</b>

634
00:44:21,809 --> 00:44:23,405
<b>Eun Ho.</b>

635
00:44:24,378 --> 00:44:26,105
<b>Don't touch me.</b>

636
00:44:28,649 --> 00:44:30,405
<b>I just remembered.</b>

637
00:44:30,685 --> 00:44:33,215
<b>You asked me to meet you there.</b>

638
00:44:33,954 --> 00:44:35,475
<b>But you weren't there.</b>

639
00:44:37,258 --> 00:44:38,985
<b>Why did you do that to me?</b>

640
00:44:40,061 --> 00:44:42,115
<b>Why? Why did you do that?</b>

641
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:04,380
<b>- I don't want that. - Aren't you tired?</b>

642
00:45:04,385 --> 00:45:06,650
<b>The tranquilizer will help you get some sleep.</b>

643
00:45:06,654 --> 00:45:08,315
<b>No.</b>

644
00:45:08,656 --> 00:45:10,650
<b>If it's unnecessary, let's just skip it.</b>

645
00:45:10,658 --> 00:45:12,860
<b>Okay, but don't stress yourself.</b>

646
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:14,385
<b>Okay.</b>

647
00:45:23,671 --> 00:45:26,125
<b>You know why Min Sung did that to me, don't you?</b>

648
00:45:27,708 --> 00:45:30,670
<b>Tell me everything. Don't leave anything out.</b>

649
00:45:30,678 --> 00:45:33,135
<b>But that won't be the full story.</b>

650
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:35,440
<b>They're just assumptions...</b>

651
00:45:35,449 --> 00:45:37,980
<b>that were made based on Min Sung's story.</b>

652
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:39,675
<b>I don't care.</b>

653
00:45:40,087 --> 00:45:42,745
<b>Did you figure out the truth by catching the culprit?</b>

654
00:45:42,923 --> 00:45:43,990
<b>You didn't.</b>

655
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:45,790
<b>You could only rely on the culprit's story.</b>

656
00:45:45,793 --> 00:45:47,455
<b>You knew that,</b>

657
00:45:50,097 --> 00:45:51,925
<b>but you started anyway.</b>

658
00:45:52,366 --> 00:45:55,255
<b>I don't care about the full story.</b>

659
00:45:57,371 --> 00:45:59,735
<b>You're not Su Jung.</b>

660
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:02,835
<b>You're still alive.</b>

661
00:46:03,944 --> 00:46:04,940
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

662
00:46:04,945 --> 00:46:06,775
<b>No, I'm sorry.</b>

663
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:09,275
<b>On my way here,</b>

664
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:14,150
<b>I only cared about your memory.</b>

665
00:46:14,155 --> 00:46:16,285
<b>You mean "Gospel of New Life"?</b>

666
00:46:17,892 --> 00:46:21,055
<b>It's the only thing you asked me about after I woke up.</b>

667
00:46:21,061 --> 00:46:23,085
<b>You were going to show me that, weren't you?</b>

668
00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:25,455
<b>I think we both need...</b>

669
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:28,895
<b>some tranquilizers.</b>

670
00:46:28,969 --> 00:46:30,495
<b>Show me.</b>

671
00:46:30,738 --> 00:46:33,070
<b>I don't know where I saw this.</b>

672
00:46:33,073 --> 00:46:35,235
<b>But I remember seeing a photo of your friend...</b>

673
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:37,810
<b>and a red cell phone.</b>

674
00:46:37,812 --> 00:46:40,375
<b>You went into the small room.</b>

675
00:46:40,614 --> 00:46:43,680
<b>I thought my brain was making things up.</b>

676
00:46:43,684 --> 00:46:46,445
<b>See? It's just a matter of time.</b>

677
00:46:46,821 --> 00:46:48,445
<b>Just show it to me.</b>

<b>(Gospel of New Life)</b>

679
00:47:18,485 --> 00:47:21,280
<b>You're right. It's a matter of time. You'll remember it one day.</b>

680
00:47:21,288 --> 00:47:23,815
<b>But you don't have much time.</b>

681
00:47:23,958 --> 00:47:25,750
<b>I should remember it as soon as I can.</b>

682
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:27,915
<b>Do you have a photo of that man?</b>

683
00:47:28,896 --> 00:47:30,585
<b>Let me see it.</b>

684
00:47:48,816 --> 00:47:52,550
<b>You saved my life today, and this is as precious as my life.</b>

685
00:47:52,553 --> 00:47:55,720
<b>If you keep this for me until I come back for it,</b>

686
00:47:55,723 --> 00:47:58,150
<b>I promise I'll repay you.</b>

687
00:47:58,158 --> 00:48:00,385
<b>I remember reading it in a room.</b>

688
00:48:01,595 --> 00:48:03,155
<b>Your room?</b>

689
00:48:04,231 --> 00:48:05,690
<b>Yes.</b>

690
00:48:05,699 --> 00:48:07,830
<b>Then I put it in my bag.</b>

691
00:48:07,835 --> 00:48:10,165
<b>- Your gym bag? - No.</b>

692
00:48:10,371 --> 00:48:12,495
<b>The bag I normally use.</b>

693
00:48:14,108 --> 00:48:17,835
<b>Didn't you take this to school the next day?</b>

694
00:48:41,535 --> 00:48:43,565
<b>(Gospel of New Life)</b>

695
00:48:47,308 --> 00:48:48,965
<b>My locker.</b>

696
00:48:49,276 --> 00:48:51,205
<b>I put it in my locker.</b>

697
00:48:57,918 --> 00:49:01,015
<b>- When? - Right before I left school.</b>

698
00:49:04,425 --> 00:49:06,555
<b>That's enough for today.</b>

699
00:49:07,895 --> 00:49:09,555
<b>What would you like to drink?</b>

700
00:49:09,596 --> 00:49:12,055
<b>Dong Myung bought me juice.</b>

701
00:49:31,285 --> 00:49:33,415
<b>- Is that enough? - Yes.</b>

702
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:41,785
<b>What's the matter?</b>

703
00:49:46,834 --> 00:49:50,025
<b>You remember things that happened more than a month ago, right?</b>

704
00:49:51,205 --> 00:49:53,165
<b>You drew an angel...</b>

705

<b>with six wings on your notebook.</b>

706

<b>Where did you see that?</b>

00:50:13,327 --> 00:50:14,955
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

708
00:50:15,496 --> 00:50:18,155
<b>A regular came unannounced, so I finished late today.</b>

709
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:21,525
<b>You're here, so I'll get going now.</b>

710
00:50:21,668 --> 00:50:23,155
<b>Thanks.</b>

711
00:50:23,470 --> 00:50:25,165
<b>You should get some rest.</b>

712
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:29,795
<b>- I'll see you. - Bye.</b>

<b>See you.</b>

<b>I need your help, Mr. Lee.</b>

715
00:51:50,491 --> 00:51:52,690
<b>Sure. I'll help.</b>

716
00:51:52,693 --> 00:51:54,855
<b>You don't even know what I'm going to ask.</b>

717
00:51:55,329 --> 00:51:56,955
<b>Because I have...</b>

<b>full trust in you.</b>

719

<b>Are you sure?</b>

720
00:52:03,604 --> 00:52:06,140
<b>It's possible that I killed a man.</b>

721

<b>However hard I think,</b>

722

<b>I don't think I'm bad enough to deserve to be killed.</b>

<b>So even if I'm around you,</b>

724
00:52:15,048 --> 00:52:16,905
<b>I have nothing to worry.</b>

725
00:52:17,818 --> 00:52:21,345
<b>So, how can I help you?</b>

726
00:52:26,793 --> 00:52:30,355
<b>Eun Ho remembered Jang Ki Ho and the Gospel of New Life.</b>

727
00:52:37,437 --> 00:52:40,270
<b>He put it in before leaving school, but it wasn't there when we checked.</b>

728
00:52:40,274 --> 00:52:42,970
<b>That means someone took it some time in-between.</b>

729
00:52:42,976 --> 00:52:44,770
<b>Baek Sang Ho and Oh Du Seok were here,</b>

730
00:52:44,778 --> 00:52:46,240
<b>but it disappeared before then.</b>

731
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:48,740
<b>That's why Oh Du Seok didn't find it in this locker.</b>

732
00:52:48,749 --> 00:52:50,050
<b>And...</b>

733
00:52:50,050 --> 00:52:51,250
<b>Min Sung saw him,</b>

734
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:52,950
<b>so he couldn't check Eun Ho's backpack.</b>

735
00:52:52,953 --> 00:52:56,190
<b>Afterwards, he stole Eun Ho's backpack,</b>

736
00:52:56,190 --> 00:52:58,690
<b>but he didn't find what he wanted inside.</b>

737
00:52:58,692 --> 00:53:00,420
<b>So he kidnapped Eun Ho.</b>

738
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:02,420
<b>Not knowing the book disappeared in the school.</b>

739
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:05,455
<b>The copy that Baek Sang Ho wants so desperately,</b>

740
00:53:06,166 --> 00:53:08,555
<b>we must find it first.</b>

741
00:53:10,571 --> 00:53:13,070
<b>Why? Is something wrong?</b>

742
00:53:13,073 --> 00:53:15,265
<b>You just said "we".</b>

743
00:53:16,109 --> 00:53:17,470
<b>It's nice to hear.</b>

744
00:53:17,477 --> 00:53:19,340
<b>You could get into trouble.</b>

745
00:53:19,346 --> 00:53:20,610
<b>Don't worry.</b>

746
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:24,305
<b>If things get too hairy for me, I'll just bail out.</b>

747
00:53:25,118 --> 00:53:26,580
<b>Why are you giving me that look?</b>

748
00:53:26,587 --> 00:53:28,175
<b>So far...</b>

749
00:53:30,390 --> 00:53:32,615
<b>you've had many chances to bail out.</b>

750
00:53:34,161 --> 00:53:36,730
<b>If you miss the chance, you might never get out.</b>

751
00:53:36,730 --> 00:53:38,655
<b>I don't know about that.</b>

752
00:53:39,399 --> 00:53:41,425
<b>But I want both you...</b>

753
00:53:41,969 --> 00:53:43,930
<b>and Eun Ho to be safe.</b>

754
00:53:43,937 --> 00:53:46,225
<b>If someone must get hurt,</b>

755
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:48,440
<b>I think it better be me.</b>

756
00:53:48,442 --> 00:53:49,995
<b>Thank you, but...</b>

757
00:53:50,377 --> 00:53:52,235
<b>I protect myself.</b>

758
00:53:53,247 --> 00:53:55,005
<b>But Eun Ho...</b>

759
00:53:56,783 --> 00:53:58,405
<b>Protect him for me.</b>

760
00:53:58,485 --> 00:54:00,850
<b>Okay. I'll do that.</b>

761
00:54:00,854 --> 00:54:02,375
<b>Let's go.</b>

762
00:54:03,890 --> 00:54:05,415
<b>Detective Cha.</b>

763
00:54:06,827 --> 00:54:10,225
<b>The angel drawing in Eun Ho's notebook...</b>

764
00:54:10,998 --> 00:54:13,230
<b>Did you ask him about it?</b>

765
00:54:13,233 --> 00:54:14,400
<b>I did.</b>

766
00:54:14,401 --> 00:54:18,430
<b>The angel with six wings that you drew in your notebook.</b>

767
00:54:18,438 --> 00:54:20,025
<b>Where did you see it?</b>

768
00:54:21,942 --> 00:54:22,940
<b>Eun Ho.</b>

769
00:54:22,943 --> 00:54:24,540
<b>Does it matter where I saw it?</b>

770
00:54:24,544 --> 00:54:27,635
<b>It's a symbol related to the stigmata killer.</b>

771
00:54:28,115 --> 00:54:30,380
<b>We tracked the killer with an angel doll...</b>

772
00:54:30,384 --> 00:54:32,575
<b>the killer had given to...</b>

773
00:54:32,919 --> 00:54:34,975
<b>the first victim's younger sister.</b>

774
00:54:34,988 --> 00:54:38,215
<b>I saw it in Mr. Lee's house.</b>

775
00:54:38,992 --> 00:54:42,215
<b>- What? - When I visited his place,</b>

776
00:54:43,597 --> 00:54:46,285
<b>Ji Won showed me her dolls.</b>

777
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:49,025
<b>She showed me the angel doll...</b>

778
00:54:50,037 --> 00:54:52,895
<b>and said the others are younger than her,</b>

779
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:56,695
<b>but that one was much older than her.</b>

780
00:54:57,544 --> 00:55:01,305
<b>I drew it because I remembered how it had six wings.</b>

781
00:55:01,448 --> 00:55:03,235
<b>Who is Ji Won?</b>

782
00:55:03,650 --> 00:55:06,275
<b>Mr. Lee's niece.</b>

783
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:12,485
<b>Why do you think Eun Ho was in your neighborhood?</b>

784
00:55:13,093 --> 00:55:14,660
<b>He must've had business there.</b>

785
00:55:14,661 --> 00:55:16,615
<b>That business...</b>

786
00:55:17,197 --> 00:55:19,425
<b>Could he have gone to your house?</b>

787
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,260
