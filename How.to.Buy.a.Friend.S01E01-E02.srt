- Oh, you were here?</b>

154
00:11:51,852 --> 00:11:55,064
<b>- Yes, I was. Why?
- Spitting Woo wanted to see you.</b>

155
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:58,577
<b>- What? Why?
- What about me? Do I have to go?</b>

156
00:11:58,601 --> 00:12:01,296
<b>- No, just Chan Hong.
- Yes!</b>

157
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,381
<b>- Beenzino's raps are the best.
- I can't believe this.</b>

<b>Mr. Woo. I'm sorry...</b>

162

<b>It's you this time.</b>

163
00:12:28,341 --> 00:12:30,341
<b>You'll be the representative

165
00:12:32,406 --> 00:12:35,430
<b>The sentences, the title.</b>

166

<b>You traitor. I'm going crazy.</b>

201

<b>There's nothing to a poem.</b>

202

<b>Write down your desires with reason.

219

222
00:15:44,781 --> 00:15:45,985
<b>I recall it was last winter.</b>

223
00:15:46,009 --> 00:15:47,438
<b>He was in a brawl
against ten guys...</b>

224
00:15:47,462 --> 00:15:49,029
<b>and he sent all of them
to the hospital.</b>

225
00:15:49,906 --> 00:15:51,826
<b>I think he went to

226

<b>I guess he's coming to our school.</b>

227

<b>There will be a storm now.</b>

228

<b>Anyway, don't get involved with him.</b>

229

<b>- Mom.
- Yes?</b>

232

<b>Can I go to Grandma's house during

<b>That's a splendid idea.</b>

238
00:16:31,508 --> 00:16:35,178
<b>- Right? It is splendid, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.</b>

239
00:16:36,586 --> 00:16:38,878

240

<b>Do you ever think about studying?</b>

<b>And do you think that I don't know

<b>What are you going to do without
me around?</b>

249

<b>Are you going to pick up more

<b>Get your head out of the gutter.</b>

251
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,846
<b>What do you mean, I pick up garbage?</b>

252
00:17:11,513 --> 00:17:14,347
<b>Mom, I'll do better after
I come back.</b>

462
00:35:17,075 --> 00:35:19,564
<b>I hope you become a great poet.</b>

463
00:35:19,588 --> 00:35:21,797
<b>Dad will support you all the way.</b>

464
00:35:21,942 --> 00:35:24,743
<b>How will you support him?</b>

465
00:35:24,767 --> 00:35:27,557
<b>Poets starve to death these days.</b>

466
00:35:27,581 --> 00:35:28,743
<b>Geez.</b>

467
00:35:28,768 --> 00:35:31,736
<b>Write something other than poems,
like a soap opera.</b>

468
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,970
<b>What could you possibly do
with a poem?</b>

469
00:35:33,994 --> 00:35:35,648
<b>You're spoiling the mood again.</b>

470
00:35:35,726 --> 00:35:38,773
<b>How can you compare a playwright
with a poet?</b>

471
00:35:38,851 --> 00:35:40,673
<b>I'm not spoiling the mood.</b>

472
00:35:40,697 --> 00:35:42,939
<b>- He can write a soap opera...
- What will I be doing?</b>

473
00:35:42,963 --> 00:35:45,915
<b>And a film and it will be great.</b>

474
00:35:45,939 --> 00:35:47,976
<b>I'm about to start a relationship.</b>

475
00:35:59,586 --> 00:36:01,398
<b>I'm amazed...</b>

476
00:36:02,558 --> 00:36:04,140
<b>at how I managed to write that.</b>

477
00:36:06,821 --> 00:36:08,281
<b>Am I a genius?</b>

478
00:36:15,914 --> 00:36:19,953
<b>As a talent I did not know I had
shown itself,</b>

479
00:36:20,737 --> 00:36:22,600
<b>the whole universe shook.</b>

480
00:36:37,103 --> 00:36:40,523
<b>Sae Yun managed to find me.</b>

481
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:42,370
<b>I...</b>

482
00:36:43,662 --> 00:36:46,851
<b>became a visible ninja.</b>

483
00:36:51,197 --> 00:36:52,836
<b>This is how...</b>

484
00:36:53,813 --> 00:36:57,351
<b>the spring of our 19th year began.</b>

485
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:02,039
<b>Spring that does not pardon
dying things...</b>

486
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:08,555
<b>and reveals things hidden
in the snow.</b>

487
00:37:10,108 --> 00:37:11,930
<b>Spring that urges you...</b>

488
00:37:12,795 --> 00:37:14,547
<b>to shoot up.</b>

489
00:38:22,465 --> 00:38:25,109
<b>(Enter your password.)</b>

490
00:38:26,343 --> 00:38:27,978

<b>(Incorrect password)</b>

493
00:38:39,686 --> 00:38:41,343
<b>Could it be Seo Jung's birthday?</b>

494
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,727
<b>(Starting the phone)</b>

495
00:39:06,718 --> 00:39:07,981
<b>(You broke your promise again.)</b>

496
00:39:08,005 --> 00:39:09,396
<b>(Send me the money now.)</b>

497
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,049
<b>(Do you want this to be spread?)</b>

498
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:34,742
<b>Spring that tells you to forget
about winter.</b>

499
00:39:35,571 --> 00:39:37,187
<b>That cruel spring...</b>

500
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,358
<b>has begun.</b>

501
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,492
<b>Gosh, he's massive.</b>

502
00:40:00,823 --> 00:40:02,353
<b>He deserves to be called Iron Man.</b>

503
00:40:02,377 --> 00:40:04,687
<b>- Shut your mouth!
- Gosh, man.</b>

504
00:40:05,205 --> 00:40:06,205
<b>It's ominous.</b>

505
00:40:07,036 --> 00:40:08,375
<b>I have a bad feeling.</b>

506
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:13,671
<b>Who's call are you waiting for?</b>

507
00:40:14,573 --> 00:40:16,180
<b>I'm not waiting for anyone.</b>

508
00:40:16,977 --> 00:40:18,351
<b>I have a bad feeling.</b>

509
00:40:18,786 --> 00:40:20,954
<b>We're in different classes
for the first time in our lives.</b>

510
00:40:20,978 --> 00:40:23,156
<b>- Isn't that ominous?
- Why would it be?</b>

511
00:40:23,447 --> 00:40:24,681
<b>That's super fine.</b>

512
00:40:24,705 --> 00:40:26,705
<b>- Get lost, class two.
- Kill yourself, class four.</b>

513
00:40:28,002 --> 00:40:30,002
<b>- Move out of my way!
- Gosh.</b>

514
00:40:37,031 --> 00:40:38,031
<b>Welcome.</b>

515
00:40:38,985 --> 00:40:40,211
<b>This way, please.</b>

516

<b>I'm grateful that you decided

<b>It's what I have to do.</b>

518

<b>This way, ma'am.</b>

519
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:01,546
<b>Is something up?</b>

520

<b>Of all people,
I'm in the same class as him?</b>

521
00:41:35,758 --> 00:41:36,859
<b>I hear you write poems.</b>

522

<b>Park Chan Hong

523

<b>Nice to meet you. I'm Kim Dae Yong.</b>

524
00:41:44,567 --> 00:41:45,567
<b>You know me, right?</b>

525
00:41:47,069 --> 00:41:48,992
<b>I do know you.</b>

526
00:41:51,336 --> 00:41:55,078
<b>Heo Don Hyuk is a punk as I heard.</b>

527
00:41:55,945 --> 00:41:58,145
<b>He should sit be in his chair
as soon as he's in school.</b>

528
00:42:00,610 --> 00:42:01,969
<b>How rude of him.</b>

529
00:42:09,093 --> 00:42:10,515
<b>This is supposed to be my seat.</b>

530
00:42:15,469 --> 00:42:17,695
<b>Being late on the first day

531

<b>You're acting cool.</b>

532
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:24,836
<b>You're only a year older than us...</b>

533

<b>so don't expect any respect.</b>

534
00:42:27,447 --> 00:42:28,447
<b>Got it?</b>

535
00:42:31,664 --> 00:42:32,864
<b>I went to school a year early.</b>

536
00:42:33,766 --> 00:42:34,766
<b>What's that?</b>

537
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:39,258
<b>We can be friends

538
00:42:40,148 --> 00:42:41,148
<b>Nice to meet you.</b>

539
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,180
<b>We'll see about that.</b>

540
00:42:54,382 --> 00:42:55,382
<b>Okay.</b>

541
00:42:55,838 --> 00:42:57,125
<b>Tell me when you're done
talking.</b>

542
00:43:05,613 --> 00:43:08,047
<b>Hey, Chan Hong. Let's go
to the cafeteria.</b>

543
00:43:08,484 --> 00:43:09,484
<b>I'm buying.</b>

544
00:43:10,386 --> 00:43:11,664
<b>Lim Seong Doo!</b>

<b>(Shin Seo Jung)</b>

546
00:43:57,197 --> 00:43:58,743
<b>That's about seven dollars.</b>

547
00:43:58,767 --> 00:44:02,091
<b>I see. I'll take this off of
your interests. You can go now.</b>

548
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,400
<b>Interest?</b>

549
00:44:04,335 --> 00:44:07,784
<b>Thank you, I'll be upstairs.</b>

550
00:44:13,601 --> 00:44:16,939
<b>Have some. I picked the best snacks.</b>

551
00:44:18,610 --> 00:44:20,799
<b>Thank you. I'll enjoy them.</b>

552
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:22,375
<b>Chan Hong.</b>

553
00:44:23,188 --> 00:44:24,985
<b>I heard you're close to Sae Yun.</b>

554
00:44:25,446 --> 00:44:29,399
<b>Me? No, I just entered the contest
with her.</b>

555
00:44:30,131 --> 00:44:31,863
<b>So we're acquaintances.</b>

556
00:44:31,887 --> 00:44:35,413
<b>Acquaintances? Many people saw you
two hang out together every day.</b>

557
00:44:37,899 --> 00:44:38,946
<b>Are you two dating?</b>

558
00:44:40,103 --> 00:44:42,501
<b>No, I'm not dating anyone.</b>

559
00:44:43,329 --> 00:44:44,329
<b>Is that so?</b>

560
00:44:45,407 --> 00:44:46,782
<b>Then introduce me to her.</b>

561
00:44:47,478 --> 00:44:49,750
<b>Timing is of the essence
with these things, right?</b>

562
00:44:50,313 --> 00:44:53,180
<b>And the thing is, I hate waiting.</b>

563
00:44:57,415 --> 00:44:59,165
<b>Okay.</b>

564
00:45:01,398 --> 00:45:02,473
<b>What's this?</b>

565
00:45:03,031 --> 00:45:04,009
<b>What?</b>

566
00:45:04,033 --> 00:45:05,196
<b>I'm leaving.</b>

567
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:06,819
<b>Come and help me.</b>

568
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:12,587
<b>Hey, Ninja.</b>

569
00:45:12,823 --> 00:45:16,346
<b>Why didn't you log in yesterday?</b>

570
00:45:16,517 --> 00:45:18,772
<b>Sorry, I went to bed
early last night.</b>

571
00:45:19,838 --> 00:45:22,791
<b>I lost the game
because you weren't there.</b>

572
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:24,807
<b>I have something to tell you.</b>

573
00:45:24,831 --> 00:45:26,479
<b>- Would you come...
- Hey.</b>

574
00:45:29,290 --> 00:45:31,743
<b>- Do you want to die?
- Sorry?</b>

575
00:45:33,876 --> 00:45:36,095
<b>I'm talking to him right now.</b>

576
00:45:36,586 --> 00:45:38,046
<b>We're having a talk.</b>

577
00:45:40,322 --> 00:45:41,322
<b>Sorry.</b>

578
00:45:42,164 --> 00:45:43,418
<b>Let's talk later.</b>

579
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:45,212
<b>Please continue.</b>

580
00:45:48,587 --> 00:45:51,046
<b>Then, you'll introduce me
to Sae Yun.</b>

581
00:45:53,416 --> 00:45:55,769
<b>Do you want anything else?
It's my treat.</b>

582
00:45:58,048 --> 00:46:01,695
<b>Do you want these? How about these?</b>

583
00:46:04,064 --> 00:46:06,120
<b>Come closer.</b>

584
00:46:06,564 --> 00:46:08,883
<b>- You talk too much.
- Stand straight.</b>

585
00:46:22,767 --> 00:46:26,321
<b>Chan Hong, do you have
some time later?</b>

586
00:46:36,555 --> 00:46:39,110
<b>Have you had that experience?</b>

587
00:46:43,501 --> 00:46:46,384
<b>You've seen something scary...</b>

588
00:46:48,047 --> 00:46:52,219
<b>and if I turn a blind eye, it can
pass like it was nothing.</b>

589
00:46:55,243 --> 00:46:58,821
<b>Me acting like I noticed it won't
make a difference...</b>

590
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:02,414
<b>so it's something scary that
I want to avoid.</b>

591
00:47:03,197 --> 00:47:04,658
<b>Do you get it?</b>

592
00:47:09,485 --> 00:47:11,063
<b>What would you...</b>

593
00:47:11,697 --> 00:47:14,040
<b>do if you saw things like that?</b>

594
00:47:17,431 --> 00:47:20,462
<b>Should I confront them
even though they are scary...</b>

595
00:47:21,516 --> 00:47:24,564
<b>or let bygones be bygones?</b>

596
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:30,614
<b>If it was me...</b>

597
00:47:33,266 --> 00:47:35,500
<b>I would like it
if you wouldn't get hurt.</b>

598
00:47:37,290 --> 00:47:39,622
<b>I don't know
what you're talking about...</b>

599
00:47:40,634 --> 00:47:41,810
<b>but whatever it is...</b>

600
00:47:43,579 --> 00:47:45,755
<b>I want you to make the choice
that makes you happier.</b>

601
00:47:47,344 --> 00:47:49,291
<b>You said it doesn't change anything.</b>

602
00:47:51,322 --> 00:47:52,661
<b>Maybe you're right.</b>

603
00:47:54,032 --> 00:47:56,742
<b>I also want to be happier.</b>

604
00:47:58,556 --> 00:48:00,329
<b>I don't want to...</b>

605
00:48:00,946 --> 00:48:03,281
<b>- introduce you to him.
- Wow, Chan Hong.</b>

606
00:48:04,087 --> 00:48:05,614
<b>You're so smart.</b>

607
00:48:06,204 --> 00:48:07,485
<b>It's nothing.</b>

608
00:48:12,314 --> 00:48:13,434
<b>Hey.</b>

609
00:48:23,165 --> 00:48:24,915
<b>Please, let this go.</b>

610
00:48:40,039 --> 00:48:42,362
<b>Hey, do I look good to you?</b>

611
00:48:42,993 --> 00:48:44,760
<b>It's not like that.</b>

612
00:48:46,508 --> 00:48:47,555
<b>Right?</b>

613
00:48:48,157 --> 00:48:51,544
<b>Someone saw you two being close
in a pizza place.</b>

614
00:48:51,829 --> 00:48:53,748
<b>There's no way you took me for
a pushover.</b>

615
00:49:00,118 --> 00:49:01,510
<b>You have until this evening.</b>

616
00:49:02,517 --> 00:49:04,040
