<b>Okay.</b>

<b>One more time.</b>

<b>Gosh, I was really impressed.</b>

173
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:45,800
<b>- What do you want to eat? - Tteokbokki made with rice cakes.</b>

174

<b>"Tteokbokki"? There's a place I frequently go to.</b>

<b>Should we eat a spicy one or...</b>

176

<b>No, let's eat the sweet one today.</b>

177

<b>Hey.</b>

178
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:01,550
<b>Hey, I thought you wanted tteokbokki.</b>

<b>Yes, tteokbokki.</b>

180

<b>Let's go eat that.</b>

181
00:14:04,393 --> 00:14:06,820
<b>There's a tteokbokki restaurant right around the corner.</b>

182
00:14:06,829 --> 00:14:11,395
<b>They use freshly made rice cakes, so it's very chewy...</b>

183

<b>Tteokbokki...</b>

184

<b>It's okay. Eat up.</b>

185
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,445
<b>Hey, you can't just...</b>

186
00:14:32,355 --> 00:14:34,815
<b>You need to put it in front of you first.</b>

187
00:14:37,593 --> 00:14:40,590
<b>We can't call this a blind date, but I had a lot of fun.</b>

188
00:14:40,596 --> 00:14:42,195
<b>Thank you.</b>

189
00:14:42,832 --> 00:14:45,700
<b>I always used to envy my friends who had older siblings.</b>

190
00:14:45,701 --> 00:14:49,095
<b>I wonder if I could think of you as my older brother.</b>

191
00:14:56,746 --> 00:14:58,575
<b>Did you get touched by what I said?</b>

192
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,385
<b>You're so not my older brother.</b>

193
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,785
<b>Are you going to stop drawing "Beodul Love"?</b>

194
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:18,125
<b>I want to keep seeing your drawings.</b>

195
00:15:19,368 --> 00:15:21,630
<b>I don't know what to draw next.</b>

196
00:15:21,637 --> 00:15:23,465
<b>Draw whatever you want.</b>

197
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:28,505
<b>I found out that people don't always like what I like.</b>

198
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:35,875
<b>And more importantly, I don't know what I want to draw next.</b>

199
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,350
<b>I guess other people have it all figured out.</b>

200
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:41,015
<b>I guess they quickly get new ideas.</b>

201
00:15:42,258 --> 00:15:43,915
<b>But not me.</b>

202
00:15:45,661 --> 00:15:47,585
<b>I guess I'm just not good enough.</b>

203
00:15:48,831 --> 00:15:52,165
<b>Try looking for it again. I'm sure you'll be able to find it.</b>

204
00:15:52,568 --> 00:15:54,225
<b>I'm not sure.</b>

205
00:15:55,171 --> 00:15:57,065
<b>But when are you leaving?</b>

206
00:15:58,641 --> 00:16:00,370
<b>I'm leaving?</b>

207
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:02,005
<b>You're not?</b>

208
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:05,805
<b>Oh, I see. Are you going to leave after you save up some money?</b>

209
00:16:06,115 --> 00:16:07,775
<b>Why would I leave?</b>

210
00:16:07,783 --> 00:16:09,815
<b>I thought your dream is to become a travel writer.</b>

211

<b>No, it's not.</b>

212
00:16:12,688 --> 00:16:14,555
<b>Then what's your dream?</b>

<b>On a blind date.</b>

<b>Yes. A date. I had a blind date.</b>

<b>I called you.</b>

<b>Oh, did you?</b>

225

<b>I didn't know.</b>

<b>It's been a while since I had fun that I couldn't check my phone.</b>

<b>We ate sushi and I got this as a present.</b>

<b>Your present is a cat doll?</b>

<b>You don't like cats.</b>

<b>Your blind date was with Mr. Bang?</b>

<b>Yes.</b>

235
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:41,670
<b>The point is that...</b>

236
00:17:41,677 --> 00:17:44,180
<b>I'm eating and living just fine.</b>

237

<b>As if nothing's wrong. Everything's fine.</b>

238

<b>I'm going now. Hey, let's go.</b>

239

<b>And sorry.</b>

<b>They'll come for him tomorrow evening.</b>

<b>Tomorrow?</b>

<b>Will you really send him away?</b>

00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:51,845
<b>I should.</b>

253
00:18:52,148 --> 00:18:54,605
<b>I was just fostering.</b>

<b>I knew I had to send him away.</b>

<b>I thought you two got close.</b>

<b>Do you know how Hong Jo came to me?</b>

257

<b>There's a complicated history involved with Jae Seon.</b>

<b>It's for the best.</b>

259
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:23,605
<b>It's all for the better.</b>

260
00:19:27,049 --> 00:19:29,615
<b>I should get some cat snacks.</b>

261
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:32,645
<b>Since he's leaving tomorrow.</b>

262

<b>A person who abandon cats.</b>

<b>(Devoted Mr. Gogalbi)</b>

<b>A person who took a cat in...</b>

<b>only to send it away.</b>

267
00:20:30,379 --> 00:20:31,980
<b>Will you really send him away?</b>

268
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:33,705
<b>Yes.</b>

269
00:20:33,949 --> 00:20:35,545
<b>I should.</b>

270

<b>I'm not a person.</b>

<b>I'm a cat.</b>

<b>Don't you think this cat is beautiful?</b>

273

<b>Did it lose its owner?</b>

274
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:03,770
<b>Cats don't have owners.</b>

<b>What do you mean?</b>

<b>Dogs have owners but cats don't.</b>

277
00:21:08,384 --> 00:21:11,545
<b>Cats just choose who they want to live with.</b>

278
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,520
<b>And this cat chose you.</b>

279

<b>Really?</b>

280
00:21:15,824 --> 00:21:18,685
<b>Then can I take it home?</b>

281
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:25,060
<b>It's used to living outdoors.</b>

<b>It will come to see you.</b>

283

<b>I want to give it a snack.</b>

<b>Grandma!</b>

285

<b>What a lie.</b>

286
00:21:40,316 --> 00:21:42,510
<b>Humans make the choice.</b>

<b>Not the cat.</b>

<b>Grandma, you were abandoned too.</b>

<b>Like me.</b>

<b>was the human's.</b>

<b>Well, I think...</b>

307
00:23:14,943 --> 00:23:17,570
<b>I think he ate garlic.</b>

308

<b>Last time it was milk. This time it's garlic.</b>

309

<b>You keep feeding your cat weird stuff.</b>

310
00:23:24,219 --> 00:23:27,145
<b>Is it so you can see me once more?</b>

311
00:23:27,256 --> 00:23:28,250
<b>What?</b>

312
00:23:28,257 --> 00:23:31,615
<b>I was just kidding. You looked so serious.</b>

<b>His symptoms aren't too bad. I'll give him some medicine.</b>

<b>Plus, I always make you get sick.</b>

<b>What are you talking about all of a sudden?</b>

<b>What about your dream to become a travel writer?</b>

380

<b>My dream is to become human.</b>

<b>You're really having trouble eating. Do you need some help?</b>

474
00:36:10,785 --> 00:36:15,720
<b>(Indirect kiss!)</b>

475
00:36:15,723 --> 00:36:17,415
<b>I'll take some more.</b>

476
00:36:22,664 --> 00:36:25,095
<b>- Some soup too. - Hey, that spoon is dirty.</b>

477
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:30,165
<b>Is that better?</b>

478
00:36:30,505 --> 00:36:32,395
<b>Just have mine.</b>

479
00:36:32,407 --> 00:36:34,100
<b>(You don't have to stop him.)</b>

480
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:36,135
<b>- Really? - Yes.</b>

481
00:36:36,678 --> 00:36:39,345
<b>- Have mine. - Wait.</b>

482
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:45,045
<b>I need to use the bathroom.</b>

483
00:36:52,026 --> 00:36:54,155
<b>We should've left her to eat her lunchbox.</b>

484
00:36:54,395 --> 00:36:56,755
<b>Why did we bring her here to make things awkward?</b>

485
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:58,530
<b>- Hey. - What?</b>

486
00:36:58,533 --> 00:37:00,295
<b>Of course it's awkward.</b>

487
00:37:00,435 --> 00:37:01,630
<b>She's the one who tattled it to Ms. Park.</b>

488
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:03,395
<b>Imagine how she would feel.</b>

489
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:07,465
<b>No way. Don't jump to conclusions.</b>

490
00:37:07,742 --> 00:37:09,735
<b>You're the one who should stop overreacting.</b>

491
00:37:11,045 --> 00:37:13,305
<b>It's not easy getting over Jae Seon, is it?</b>

492
00:37:14,015 --> 00:37:15,705
<b>You look so haggard.</b>

493
00:37:17,285 --> 00:37:18,915
<b>It's not what you think.</b>

494
00:37:20,054 --> 00:37:21,985
<b>I'm sending the cat away too today.</b>

495
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,155
<b>I feel much better now.</b>

496
00:37:25,727 --> 00:37:27,855
<b>Get over that cat with a dog.</b>

497
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:30,355
<b>How did the blind date go?</b>

498
00:37:31,733 --> 00:37:33,525
<b>Didn't I tell you?</b>

499
00:37:37,805 --> 00:37:40,865
<b>Those darn cats ate all the food waste...</b>

500
00:37:42,243 --> 00:37:46,845
<b>What's with that face, young man? Why do you look so depressed?</b>

501
00:37:47,815 --> 00:37:49,775
<b>Are you worried about something?</b>

502
00:37:50,985 --> 00:37:53,550
<b>I'm the man you should come to when you're worried.</b>

503
00:37:53,554 --> 00:37:56,915
<b>Back in the days, my middle name was "worry".</b>

504
00:37:57,725 --> 00:37:59,785
<b>So, tell me what's up.</b>

505
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:05,960
<b>It seems to me like it's not about some childish dating problem.</b>

506
00:38:05,967 --> 00:38:08,100
<b>She's getting rid of me.</b>

507
00:38:08,102 --> 00:38:09,470
<b>It is a dating problem.</b>

508
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:14,365
<b>Yes, I knew it. Every time, dating is the problem.</b>

509
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:16,670
<b>Of course she'll get rid of me.</b>

510
00:38:16,678 --> 00:38:18,975
<b>If I think about it, I haven't done anything for her.</b>

511
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,210
<b>All I did was receive things.</b>

512
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:23,375
<b>Well, it's natural for people to rely on others.</b>

513
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:25,150
<b>I'm not even a person.</b>

514
00:38:25,153 --> 00:38:27,650
<b>What are you then? Are you a cat?</b>

515
00:38:27,655 --> 00:38:29,285
<b>Yes.</b>

516
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:32,590
<b>I see.</b>

517
00:38:32,593 --> 00:38:35,160
<b>How can I become a real person?</b>

518
00:38:35,163 --> 00:38:37,230
<b>Even I'm not a proper person either.</b>

519
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:38,955
<b>Gosh, you.</b>

520
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:41,030
<b>You should've told me from the beginning.</b>

521
00:38:41,035 --> 00:38:43,900
<b>I heard he's Sol Ah's stepbrother.</b>

522
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:46,240
<b>- What? Is that true? - Yes.</b>

523
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,240
<b>If he's family with Sol Ah, he's like family to us too.</b>

524
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:53,140
<b>I know. We can't even order him around from now on.</b>

525
00:38:53,147 --> 00:38:55,410
<b>- I guess so. - What do we do?</b>

526
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:57,050
<b>The restaurant is a mess right now.</b>

527
00:38:57,051 --> 00:38:59,415
<b>We need all the help we can get.</b>

528
00:39:12,066 --> 00:39:14,530
<b>It's not like money makes a person,</b>

529
00:39:14,535 --> 00:39:17,530
<b>but it is necessary for people to live more properly.</b>

530
00:39:17,538 --> 00:39:20,405
<b>Consider it an advance from your paycheck.</b>

531
00:39:34,021 --> 00:39:36,615
<b>- It's made with rice cakes, right? - Yes, it is.</b>

532
00:39:36,758 --> 00:39:38,785
<b>Do you want some fried snacks too?</b>

533
00:39:44,866 --> 00:39:47,525
<b>She didn't say anything like that.</b>

534
00:39:50,438 --> 00:39:52,435
<b>Hong Jo, I'm home.</b>

535
00:39:55,176 --> 00:39:57,135
<b>Hong Jo.</b>

536
00:39:59,514 --> 00:40:03,375
<b>Hong Jo, where are you?</b>

537
00:40:04,118 --> 00:40:06,245
<b>Hong Jo.</b>

538
00:40:10,057 --> 00:40:11,785
<b>Hong Jo.</b>

539
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:13,955
<b>Hong Jo.</b>

540
00:40:18,266 --> 00:40:20,495
<b>Where did he go?</b>

541
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:26,335
<b>What do I do?</b>

542
00:40:27,942 --> 00:40:29,905
<b>Hong Jo.</b>

543
00:40:30,578 --> 00:40:32,405
<b>Hong Jo.</b>

00:40:35,249 --> 00:40:37,175
<b>Hong Jo.</b>

00:40:41,722 --> 00:40:43,315
<b>Hong Jo.</b>

547
00:40:47,562 --> 00:40:49,925
<b>Should I go ask Jae Seon?</b>

548
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:58,465
<b>I should keep looking for him.</b>

549
00:41:03,978 --> 00:41:05,705
<b>Hong Jo.</b>

550
00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:20,825
<b>Hong Jo.</b>

<b>Hong Jo.</b>

00:41:33,841 --> 00:41:35,535
<b>What do I do?</b>

00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:38,005
<b>Hong Jo.</b>

00:41:39,146 --> 00:41:40,905

00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:50,315
<b>(Cat Shelter)</b>

557
00:42:53,621 --> 00:42:55,885
<b>Shall I rest in here?</b>

558
00:43:10,271 --> 00:43:12,035
<b>Hong Jo.</b>

<b>Hong Jo.</b>

562
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:21,805
<b>- Did you see the dead cat? - Yes.</b>

563
00:43:21,816 --> 00:43:23,975
<b>I feel so sorry for it.</b>

564
00:43:26,087 --> 00:43:27,915
<b>Where is that cat?</b>

565
00:43:30,591 --> 00:43:33,820
<b>I lost my cat.</b>

566
00:43:33,828 --> 00:43:37,525
<b>The security guard buried it in that empty lot over there.</b>

567
00:44:50,004 --> 00:44:51,665
<b>Hong Jo.</b>

568
00:45:06,353 --> 00:45:07,915
<b>Please...</b>

569
00:46:22,596 --> 00:46:24,925
<b>Miss, what are you doing here?</b>

570
00:46:25,466 --> 00:46:28,330
<b>I'm looking for a cat.</b>

571
00:46:28,335 --> 00:46:30,770
<b>I heard a dead cat was buried here.</b>

572
00:46:30,771 --> 00:46:33,470
<b>Oh, that cat?</b>

573
00:46:33,474 --> 00:46:37,140
<b>It got hit by a car, so I buried it here.</b>

574
00:46:37,144 --> 00:46:39,205
<b>Was it yours?</b>

575
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:43,875
<b>I don't think it is.</b>

576
00:46:48,656 --> 00:46:50,915
<b>- Thank you. - I thought...</b>

577
00:46:50,958 --> 00:46:54,060
<b>you were going to hurt the cat.</b>

578
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:56,025
<b>Why would someone do that?</b>

579
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:59,230
<b>Because they're noisy,</b>

580
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:02,495
<b>dirty, or believed to bring bad luck.</b>

581
00:47:04,338 --> 00:47:07,305
<b>Because they're weaker than humans.</b>

582
00:47:10,811 --> 00:47:13,440
<b>People even abandon their pets.</b>

583
00:47:13,447 --> 00:47:15,710
<b>I saw an expensive breed nearby.</b>

584
00:47:15,716 --> 00:47:17,980
<b>It had hurt its leg.</b>

585
00:47:17,985 --> 00:47:21,445
<b>I was waiting to catch it and look after it.</b>

586
00:47:22,957 --> 00:47:25,860
<b>Abandoned pets?</b>

587
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:29,685
<b>An abandoned pet cat is as good as dead.</b>

588
00:47:31,866 --> 00:47:34,395
<b>It'll get much colder soon.</b>

589
00:48:11,038 --> 00:48:12,765
<b>Is Sol Ah in?</b>

590
00:48:14,241 --> 00:48:16,935
<b>Why won't she answer her phone?</b>

591
00:48:17,544 --> 00:48:21,045
<b>I came for the cat. Can I come in?</b>

592
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:26,450
<b>The new owner's waiting for it.</b>

593
00:48:26,453 --> 00:48:28,715
<b>The agreed time's already passed.</b>

594
00:48:30,057 --> 00:48:31,750
<b>I'll just take the cat.</b>

595
00:48:31,759 --> 00:48:33,555
<b>You can't take it.</b>

596
00:48:43,037 --> 00:48:45,030
<b>I talked about it with Sol Ah.</b>

597
00:48:45,039 --> 00:48:46,600
<b>The cat's not here...</b>

598
00:48:46,607 --> 00:48:48,235
<b>anymore.</b>

599
00:48:49,944 --> 00:48:51,640
<b>What does that mean?</b>

600
00:48:51,645 --> 00:48:53,510
<b>Cats are like that.</b>

601
00:48:53,514 --> 00:48:55,545
<b>When it's time to leave,</b>

602
00:48:55,749 --> 00:48:57,545
<b>they leave on their own.</b>

603
00:48:59,987 --> 00:49:01,545
<b>Hey.</b>

604
00:49:02,056 --> 00:49:03,685
<b>Wait.</b>

605
00:49:27,314 --> 00:49:29,645
<b>I'll turn into a cat if I sleep.</b>

606
00:49:30,718 --> 00:49:32,745
<b>And I'll be abandoned.</b>

611
00:50:09,123 --> 00:50:12,055
<b>The new owner waited for a long time.</b>

612
00:50:12,526 --> 00:50:14,125
<b>Sorry.</b>

613
00:50:17,164 --> 00:50:19,055
<b>Did something happen?</b>

614
00:50:21,635 --> 00:50:23,595

<b>What?</b>

617
00:50:28,375 --> 00:50:30,035
<b>When?</b>

618
00:50:31,045 --> 00:50:32,340
<b>I don't know.</b>

619
00:50:32,346 --> 00:50:35,575
<b>You don't even know when he disappeared?</b>

620
00:50:35,883 --> 00:50:37,880
<b>I didn't see him this morning...</b>

621

<b>And you didn't care?</b>

622
00:50:40,054 --> 00:50:41,750
<b>He always comes back after...</b>

623
00:50:41,755 --> 00:50:43,315
<b>So what?</b>

624
00:50:43,824 --> 00:50:46,260
<b>So you always left the window open?</b>

625
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:47,960
<b>I told you to be careful.</b>

626
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:49,525
<b>Yes.</b>

627
00:50:50,230 --> 00:50:52,525
<b>I'm sorry for being careless.</b>

628

<b>But all this while...</b>

629
00:50:54,635 --> 00:50:57,065
<b>Neglecting it is abandonment too.</b>

630
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:01,300
<b>What?</b>

631
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:03,505
<b>You abandoned him.</b>

632
00:51:04,645 --> 00:51:06,505
<b>Again.</b>

633
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:10,045
<b>"Again"?</b>

634
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:15,785
<b>What are you saying? Why would I abandon Hong Jo?</b>

635
00:51:18,792 --> 00:51:20,585
<b>Do you think...</b>

636
00:51:21,895 --> 00:51:24,595
<b>I still have feelings for you,</b>

637
00:51:25,532 --> 00:51:30,195
<b>so I got rid of the cat your ex-girlfriend had?</b>

638
00:51:33,307 --> 00:51:35,370
<b>Do you think that little of me?</b>

639
00:51:35,375 --> 00:51:36,540
<b>It's not that. You...</b>

640
00:51:36,543 --> 00:51:38,575
<b>I didn't abandon Hong Jo.</b>

641
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:43,775
<b>The one I abandoned...</b>

642
00:51:44,318 --> 00:51:47,015
<b>is you, Jae Seon, not Hong Jo.</b>

643
00:52:13,847 --> 00:52:17,245
<b>I shouldn't have taken in his cat at all.</b>

644
00:52:24,258 --> 00:52:26,720
<b>A cat is a cat.</b>

645
00:52:26,727 --> 00:52:28,885
<b>I just can't like...</b>

646
00:52:31,498 --> 00:52:33,225
<b>Hong Jo.</b>

647
00:52:40,741 --> 00:52:42,735
<b>Hong Jo.</b>

648
00:52:43,544 --> 00:52:47,205
<b>You darn cat.</b>

649
00:52:47,214 --> 00:52:49,275
<b>Hong Jo.</b>

650
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:53,845
<b>I can't help it. I am a dog.</b>

651
00:52:54,488 --> 00:52:56,545
<b>A dog that...</b>

652
00:52:56,557 --> 00:52:58,815
<b>fell for a cat.</b>

653
00:53:18,812 --> 00:53:21,305
<b>Tteokbokki and fish-shaped buns?</b>

654
00:53:23,550 --> 00:53:25,775
<b>Thanks anyway.</b>

655
00:53:27,654 --> 00:53:29,315
<b>Let's eat.</b>

656
00:53:34,995 --> 00:53:37,930
<b>If I hadn't gone out to look for Hong Jo,</b>

657
00:53:37,931 --> 00:53:40,525
<b>it wouldn't have gotten so soggy.</b>

658
00:53:40,667 --> 00:53:42,495
<b>You were...</b>

659
00:53:43,770 --> 00:53:46,170
<b>looking for the cat all this time?</b>

660
00:53:46,173 --> 00:53:49,740
<b>Yes. I thought I'd lost him, but he was sleeping in the closet.</b>

661
00:53:49,743 --> 00:53:51,835
<b>That shameless jerk.</b>

662
00:53:52,446 --> 00:53:54,240
<b>Why did you look for it?</b>

663
00:53:54,248 --> 00:53:56,075
<b>It's not your cat.</b>

664
00:53:57,951 --> 00:53:59,775
<b>There's a saying.</b>

665
00:53:59,786 --> 00:54:02,250
<b>Cats don't have owners.</b>

666
00:54:02,256 --> 00:54:06,190
<b>It's the cat that chooses which human it wants to be with.</b>

667
00:54:06,193 --> 00:54:08,690
<b>I bet humans came up with that.</b>

668
00:54:08,695 --> 00:54:10,490
<b>To avoid the responsibility.</b>

669
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:13,295
<b>I guess that's possible.</b>

670
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:18,595
<b>What would you choose?</b>

671
00:54:24,811 --> 00:54:26,505
<b>I don't know.</b>

672
00:54:29,983 --> 00:54:31,210
<b>(Missing cat)</b>

673
00:54:31,218 --> 00:54:33,045
<b>(It's called Hong Jo.)</b>

674
00:54:37,457 --> 00:54:40,455
<b>(Missing cat)</b>

675
00:54:50,437 --> 00:54:51,900
<b>Hello?</b>

676
00:54:51,905 --> 00:54:54,965
<b>I'm the person who said I'd take the cat.</b>

677
00:54:56,777 --> 00:54:59,040
<b>I'm sorry about earlier.</b>

678
00:54:59,046 --> 00:55:00,740
<b>The cat...</b>

679
00:55:00,747 --> 00:55:05,550
<b>Oh, no. I think it worked out, actually.</b>

680
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:06,550
<b>Pardon?</b>

681
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:09,850
<b>I just found out that I'm pregnant.</b>

682
00:55:09,856 --> 00:55:13,190
<b>I'd resorted to having a pet instead of a child.</b>

683
00:55:13,193 --> 00:55:15,660
<b>We've been trying so hard, you see.</b>

684
00:55:15,662 --> 00:55:17,555
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

685
00:55:21,168 --> 00:55:22,760
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

686
00:55:22,769 --> 00:55:25,800
<b>The doctors had said we were infertile,</b>

687
00:55:25,806 --> 00:55:27,040
<b>but we got pregnant.</b>

688
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:28,935
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

689
00:55:31,545 --> 00:55:34,340
<b>Don't go. Mom.</b>

690
00:55:34,348 --> 00:55:35,880
<b>Mom, don't go.</b>

691
00:55:35,882 --> 00:55:37,710
<b>- This will be... - Mom.</b>

692
00:55:37,718 --> 00:55:39,980
<b>- his second time being abandoned. - Mom, don't go.</b>

693
00:55:39,986 --> 00:55:43,350
<b>- We're really sorry. - Don't go. Don't go!</b>

694
00:55:43,357 --> 00:55:46,720
<b>Don't go. Don't go.</b>

695
00:55:46,727 --> 00:55:48,585
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

696
00:56:02,242 --> 00:56:03,805
<b>Jae Seon.</b>

697
00:56:31,571 --> 00:56:34,965
<b>(I'm sorry.)</b>

698
00:56:41,448 --> 00:56:43,475
<b>I found him in the closet.</b>

699
00:56:43,784 --> 00:56:46,245
<b>He was fast asleep.</b>

700
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:52,285
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

701
00:56:56,496 --> 00:57:00,195
<b>(I'm sorry.)</b>

702
00:57:03,937 --> 00:57:05,535
<b>Hand him over.</b>

703
00:57:07,207 --> 00:57:08,935
<b>I'll take him.</b>

704
00:57:13,547 --> 00:57:15,645
<b>Sorry, but you can't have him.</b>

705
00:57:17,818 --> 00:57:19,515
<b>I won't let you.</b>

706
00:57:21,087 --> 00:57:22,980
<b>You can't have him.</b>

707
00:57:22,989 --> 00:57:24,490
<b>Why not?</b>

708
00:57:24,491 --> 00:57:27,255
<b>You don't like cats.</b>

709
00:57:33,667 --> 00:57:35,295
<b>I like...</b>

710
00:57:37,337 --> 00:57:38,965
<b>Hong Jo.</b>

711
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:06,555
<b>(I'm alone again today.)</b>

712
00:58:17,377 --> 00:58:18,975
<b>(I'm alone again today.)</b>

713
00:58:24,384 --> 00:58:27,945
<b>I think I found something I want to draw.</b>

714
00:59:13,833 --> 00:59:15,965
<b>Who lost their passport?</b>

715
00:59:16,736 --> 00:59:18,635
<b>Mr. Bang Guk Bong?</b>

716
00:59:20,774 --> 00:59:22,835
<b>Are you Mr. Bang Guk Bong?</b>

717
00:59:42,696 --> 00:59:45,860
<b>(Meow, the Secret Boy)</b>

718
00:59:45,865 --> 00:59:48,300
<b>Hong Jo likes you too.</b>

719
00:59:48,301 --> 00:59:50,270
<b>Did you just come out of that house?</b>

720
00:59:50,270 --> 00:59:52,700
<b>She liked him for 10 years?</b>

721
00:59:52,706 --> 00:59:54,940
<b>It has been a long time.</b>

722
00:59:54,941 --> 00:59:57,170
<b>There's no room for me to get in between.</b>

723
00:59:57,177 --> 00:59:58,640
<b>Who are you?</b>

724
00:59:58,645 --> 01:00:01,410
<b>I might not be able to show up in front of you.</b>

725
01:00:01,414 --> 01:00:03,710
<b>You really won't talk about yourself.</b>

726
01:00:03,717 --> 01:00:05,510
<b>I want to be with you.</b>

727
01:00:05,518 --> 01:00:07,445
<b>What can't you say?</b>

728
01:00:07,487 --> 01:00:10,150
<b>You put the scarf around a boy's neck?</b>

729
01:00:10,156 --> 01:00:12,485
<b>Hong Jo was wrapped in this scarf?</b>
