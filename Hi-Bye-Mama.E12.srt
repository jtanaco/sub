<b>You wouldn't look like that if you won.</b>

163
00:13:51,113 --> 00:13:52,740
<b>You'd have your shoulders pulled back.</b>

164
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:55,565
<b>"I'm Go Hyeon-jeong. How dare you!"</b>

165
00:13:59,288 --> 00:14:00,775
<b>What's wrong?</b>

166
00:14:04,861 --> 00:14:06,715
<b>But come to think about it,</b>

167
00:14:09,866 --> 00:14:12,285
<b>I love him too much.</b>

168
00:14:24,513 --> 00:14:25,895
<b>Hyeon-jeong.</b>

169
00:14:33,556 --> 00:14:34,745
<b>Hyeon-jeong.</b>

170
00:14:38,728 --> 00:14:40,790
<b>-Gosh! You scared me! -Goodness.</b>

171
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:42,185
<b>Damn you!</b>

172
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,760
<b>Did my good looks scare you?</b>

173
00:14:44,767 --> 00:14:46,630
<b>Pull yourself together.</b>

174
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:49,030
<b>You win some, you lose some. You can't always win.</b>

175
00:14:49,038 --> 00:14:50,500
<b>Do you think I lost?</b>

176
00:14:50,506 --> 00:14:52,870
<b>No. You probably killed them all.</b>

177
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:55,240
<b>Good job. I'll take care of the settlement.</b>

178
00:14:55,244 --> 00:14:56,725
<b>Well done.</b>

179
00:15:07,456 --> 00:15:09,305
<b>Hello?</b>

180
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:16,215
<b>What the...</b>

181
00:15:19,435 --> 00:15:21,770
<b>Wait. Hey.</b>

182
00:15:21,771 --> 00:15:23,025
<b>Hey.</b>

183
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,625
<b>You.</b>

184
00:15:26,542 --> 00:15:27,925
<b>Hey!</b>

185
00:15:36,552 --> 00:15:38,205
<b>Who are you?</b>

186
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,245
<b>I'm here for your daughter.</b>

187
00:15:48,297 --> 00:15:50,115
<b>Guk-bong!</b>

188
00:15:50,299 --> 00:15:52,755
<b>Let's not be so unethical!</b>

189
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:54,785
<b>Ms. Mi-dong.</b>

190
00:15:59,241 --> 00:16:00,640
<b>Who is that?</b>

191
00:16:00,643 --> 00:16:02,995
<b>Is he talking about Seo-woo?</b>

192
00:16:06,082 --> 00:16:08,950
<b>Take a break, Ms. Mi-dong.</b>

193
00:16:08,951 --> 00:16:10,880
<b>I said I'd take care of them.</b>

194
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:12,405
<b>Until when?</b>

195
00:16:12,655 --> 00:16:16,390
<b>When every exorcist in the country swarms to this place?</b>

196
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,145
<b>What is he talking about?</b>

197
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:19,645
<b>Ms. Mi-dong.</b>

198
00:16:20,129 --> 00:16:21,745
<b>Snap out of it.</b>

199
00:16:22,164 --> 00:16:24,855
<b>She's not your friend. She's your job.</b>

200
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,255
<b>Next time, I'll see you with your daughter,</b>

201
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:33,655
<b>Cha Yu-ri.</b>

202
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:47,845
<b>What does that mean?</b>

203
00:16:48,157 --> 00:16:49,990
<b>He's here to take Seo-woo?</b>

204
00:16:49,992 --> 00:16:52,045
<b>Why would shamans and exorcists swarm here?</b>

205
00:16:55,398 --> 00:16:56,685
<b>Ms. Mi-dong.</b>

206
00:16:58,701 --> 00:17:00,985
<b>Your daughter still sees ghosts.</b>

207
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,355
<b>Yes.</b>

208
00:17:04,306 --> 00:17:06,695
<b>I got rid of all the local ghosts,</b>

209
00:17:06,842 --> 00:17:08,395
<b>but she still sees ghosts.</b>

210
00:17:08,878 --> 00:17:11,210
<b>Why would she see them when they are not around anymore?</b>

211
00:17:11,213 --> 00:17:13,295
<b>Well... That's...</b>

212
00:17:14,717 --> 00:17:16,310
<b>I don't know.</b>

213
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:19,120
<b>Anyway, if your daughter keeps seeing ghosts like that,</b>

214
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:21,805
<b>she will have to live like me or the exorcists you just met.</b>

215
00:17:22,024 --> 00:17:23,905
<b>No. Not a chance.</b>

216
00:17:25,661 --> 00:17:27,560
<b>Well...</b>

217
00:17:27,563 --> 00:17:30,845
<b>Maybe that's because she still has the energy of the local ghost.</b>

218
00:17:31,567 --> 00:17:33,400
<b>She won't see them in a few days.</b>

219
00:17:33,402 --> 00:17:37,325
<b>I'll make sure to keep ghosts away from her during my time here.</b>

220
00:17:39,575 --> 00:17:42,495
<b>Do you still not want to get your place back?</b>

221
00:17:48,684 --> 00:17:50,035
<b>No.</b>

222
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:52,880
<b>I don't.</b>

223
00:17:52,888 --> 00:17:54,375
<b>Why not?</b>

224
00:17:55,057 --> 00:17:57,845
<b>Anyone else would do anything to get their place back.</b>

225
00:17:57,993 --> 00:18:01,045
<b>You have a chance to stay alive.</b>

226
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:08,685
<b>Do you know what Seo-woo likes the most?</b>

227
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:11,455
<b>What is it?</b>

228
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:15,295
<b>Her mom.</b>

229
00:18:19,782 --> 00:18:21,405
<b>Do you know</b>

230
00:18:21,784 --> 00:18:24,635
<b>when Seo-woo wears the broadest smile?</b>

231
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:29,745
<b>When she runs to her mom.</b>

232
00:18:34,997 --> 00:18:37,090
<b>It's so pretty.</b>

233
00:18:37,099 --> 00:18:40,285
<b>This is your favorite princess doll.</b>

234
00:18:42,738 --> 00:18:44,255
<b>Mom.</b>

235
00:18:45,508 --> 00:18:46,925
<b>Mom?</b>

236
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:49,210
<b>Do you like your mom?</b>

237
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,395
<b>Mom is my favorite.</b>

238
00:18:52,114 --> 00:18:53,895
<b>Seo-woo.</b>

239
00:18:54,116 --> 00:18:55,810
<b>Mom!</b>

240
00:18:55,818 --> 00:18:57,735
<b>Seo-woo, are you all right?</b>

241
00:19:00,422 --> 00:19:02,845
<b>-Don't run. -Mom.</b>

242
00:19:03,492 --> 00:19:06,245
<b>I told you not to run. Are you all right?</b>

243
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:12,915
<b>Seo-woo loves her mom so much.</b>

244
00:19:13,469 --> 00:19:16,425
<b>She can't live without her mom.</b>

245
00:19:17,773 --> 00:19:19,925
<b>I can't take that away from her.</b>

246
00:19:22,945 --> 00:19:24,595
<b>My gosh.</b>

247
00:19:25,614 --> 00:19:27,910
<b>I'll go. I'll disappear.</b>

248
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:30,165
<b>Then Seo-woo will be fine, won't she?</b>

249
00:19:30,186 --> 00:19:31,380
<b>She won't have to see ghosts.</b>

250
00:19:31,387 --> 00:19:32,950
<b>I don't know that for sure.</b>

251
00:19:32,955 --> 00:19:35,375
<b>I'll go up there and beg.</b>

252
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,445
<b>I don't have to be reincarnated.</b>

253
00:19:38,527 --> 00:19:40,115
<b>I'm willing to fall under.</b>

254
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:47,925
<b>I was dead anyway.</b>

255
00:19:48,704 --> 00:19:50,355
<b>I have no regrets.</b>

256
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:55,895
<b>Only those who can't give up anything have regrets.</b>

257
00:19:55,978 --> 00:19:57,825
<b>I've given up everything already.</b>

258
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:00,295
<b>I have no regrets or lingering attachments.</b>

259
00:20:04,186 --> 00:20:05,675
<b>Fine.</b>

260
00:20:07,056 --> 00:20:08,475
<b>I get it.</b>

261
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:13,475
<b>A mom can even kill herself if it's for her child.</b>

262
00:20:13,862 --> 00:20:16,045
<b>There's nothing that can stop you.</b>

263
00:20:19,034 --> 00:20:21,670
<b>Stay by your daughter and protect her</b>

264
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:24,085
<b>until the 49th day.</b>

265
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,300
<b>That exorcist will be back.</b>

266
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:29,525
<b>He will make your daughter live like us.</b>

267
00:20:30,379 --> 00:20:32,935
<b>There's no way it will happen.</b>

268
00:20:33,182 --> 00:20:35,205
<b>I will protect my daughter myself.</b>

269
00:20:40,256 --> 00:20:43,745
<b>Oh, right. Well...</b>

270
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:47,545
<b>How did you make me stick to this earlier?</b>

271
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:50,715
<b>I'm a human now.</b>

272
00:20:50,899 --> 00:20:52,255
<b>What?</b>

273
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:54,230
<b>Well...</b>

274
00:20:54,236 --> 00:20:55,855
<b>It's not like</b>

275
00:20:56,071 --> 00:20:58,095
<b>you're a complete human.</b>

276
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:01,025
<b>You're neither one nor the other.</b>

277
00:21:09,251 --> 00:21:11,435
<b>If you would do this,</b>

278
00:21:12,054 --> 00:21:14,475
<b>why did you send her in the first place?</b>

279
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:30,400
<b>-Where's Yu-ri? -I guess she's in her room.</b>

280
00:21:30,406 --> 00:21:32,070
<b>-I'll go get her. -No.</b>

281
00:21:32,074 --> 00:21:33,795
<b>I'll go see her. I will.</b>

282
00:21:37,246 --> 00:21:38,765
<b>That exorcist?</b>

283
00:21:39,281 --> 00:21:41,665
<b>Don't you dare mess with my daughter.</b>

284
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:45,975
<b>My baby.</b>

285
00:21:46,922 --> 00:21:48,090
<b>Mom.</b>

286
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:49,290
<b>Come and have breakfast.</b>

287
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:50,805
<b>Okay.</b>

288
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,595
<b>Yu-ri. Try some of this too.</b>

289
00:22:13,949 --> 00:22:15,450
<b>You like potatoes.</b>

290
00:22:15,451 --> 00:22:17,410
<b>She likes rolled omelets more.</b>

291
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:19,650
<b>She likes potatoes too.</b>

292
00:22:19,655 --> 00:22:22,150
<b>I bought a lot of potatoes when you guys were young.</b>

293
00:22:22,157 --> 00:22:24,445
<b>You did? Did he do that?</b>

294
00:22:24,693 --> 00:22:25,720
<b>I like everything.</b>

295
00:22:25,728 --> 00:22:29,015
<b>I like potatoes and rolled omelets.</b>

296
00:22:29,698 --> 00:22:32,200
<b>She will eat what she wants to eat.</b>

297
00:22:32,201 --> 00:22:34,885
<b>Stop making a fuss and eat your food.</b>

298
00:22:35,137 --> 00:22:37,825
<b>She might feel too pressured to eat.</b>

299
00:22:38,173 --> 00:22:40,840
<b>Mom, don't you think you're being</b>

300
00:22:40,843 --> 00:22:43,865
<b>unfair to us with the soup to say that?</b>

301
00:22:51,053 --> 00:22:54,475
<b>Your dad and you have had a lot of it.</b>

302
00:22:55,891 --> 00:22:57,645
<b>Make sure to eat it all up.</b>

303
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,575
<b>Okay.</b>

304
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:03,485
<b>-Go ahead and eat. -Let's eat.</b>

305
00:23:17,913 --> 00:23:19,310
<b>Hang on.</b>

306
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:22,210
<b>-No. -Let me say that again.</b>

307
00:23:22,217 --> 00:23:23,810
<b>-You can't. -Again.</b>

308
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,735
<b>-Let's do this again. -Okay. Fine.</b>

309
00:23:27,523 --> 00:23:29,720
<b>-So you're... -Me?</b>

310
00:23:29,725 --> 00:23:32,760
<b>-...38 years old. -Right.</b>

311
00:23:32,761 --> 00:23:36,885
<b>-I'm 38. -And you're 44.</b>

312
00:23:37,099 --> 00:23:39,100
<b>Gosh, that's a lot.</b>

313
00:23:39,101 --> 00:23:41,230
<b>-Hey! -What are you talking about?</b>

314
00:23:41,236 --> 00:23:43,055
<b>Gosh, I can't believe this.</b>

315
00:23:43,405 --> 00:23:45,900
<b>This is why we shouldn't hang out with young girls.</b>

316
00:23:45,908 --> 00:23:47,570
<b>She's young and pretty.</b>

317
00:23:47,576 --> 00:23:49,410
<b>She's pretty, and she's even young.</b>

318
00:23:49,411 --> 00:23:51,240
<b>I really hate you.</b>

319
00:23:51,246 --> 00:23:54,410
<b>I just hate pretty girls.</b>

320
00:23:54,416 --> 00:23:57,565
<b>I will just call you by your names.</b>

321
00:23:58,987 --> 00:24:01,075
<b>-Whatever you want. -Hyeon-jeong.</b>

322
00:24:04,393 --> 00:24:06,145
<b>Do-yeon.</b>

323
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:12,655
<b>This is nice. I got some friends.</b>

324
00:24:13,802 --> 00:24:15,100
<b>She said she left others out.</b>

325
00:24:15,103 --> 00:24:18,225
<b>Is this her first time to make real friends?</b>

326
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,600
<b>-Yes, you're right. -What did you say?</b>

327
00:24:20,609 --> 00:24:22,970
<b>She was like a voluntary outcast.</b>

328
00:24:22,978 --> 00:24:24,370
<b>Excuse me.</b>

329
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:26,440
<b>You guys are having fun. Can I take a photo of you?</b>

330
00:24:26,448 --> 00:24:28,650
<b>-No. -Yes!</b>

331
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:32,275
<b>-Let's do that. -One, two, and three.</b>

332
00:24:33,956 --> 00:24:35,650
<b>I bet it will look cool.</b>

333
00:24:35,657 --> 00:24:37,120
<b>Let me see.</b>

334
00:24:37,125 --> 00:24:38,820
<b>Let's see who looks prettiest here.</b>

335
00:24:38,827 --> 00:24:40,975
<b>Let me see.</b>

336
00:24:42,498 --> 00:24:44,685
<b>Gosh, there's nothing.</b>

337
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,615
<b>It's so strange.</b>

338
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:50,170
<b>Nothing's on here.</b>

339
00:24:50,172 --> 00:24:51,485
<b>What's wrong with this?</b>

340
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:18,015
<b>Seo-woo has been watching me.</b>

341
00:25:19,835 --> 00:25:21,055
<b>That's why...</b>

342
00:25:25,874 --> 00:25:28,395
<b>What was she looking at?</b>

343
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:57,355
<b>Are you leaving?</b>

344
00:25:57,506 --> 00:25:58,695
<b>Yes.</b>

345
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,265
<b>We've become very close, right?</b>

346
00:26:07,215 --> 00:26:08,735
<b>I think so.</b>

347
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:12,075
<b>Do you like it?</b>

348
00:26:12,888 --> 00:26:14,105
<b>Yes.</b>

349
00:26:14,523 --> 00:26:16,505
<b>I laugh a lot when I'm with them.</b>

350
00:26:18,627 --> 00:26:21,015
<b>-I'll see you later. -Gang-hwa.</b>

351
00:26:23,398 --> 00:26:25,285
<b>It might rain today.</b>

352
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,615
<b>I have one here.</b>

353
00:26:37,045 --> 00:26:39,635
<b>You need a bigger one not to get wet.</b>

354
00:26:41,049 --> 00:26:42,365
<b>I see.</b>

355
00:26:42,918 --> 00:26:44,235
<b>You're right.</b>

356
00:26:46,455 --> 00:26:48,250
<b>Don't look at me like that.</b>

357
00:26:48,256 --> 00:26:52,045
<b>I said I'd stop being considerate.</b>

358
00:26:53,095 --> 00:26:54,715
<b>This isn't being considerate?</b>

359
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:58,315
<b>No. I'm just doing what I want to do.</b>

360
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,430
<b>And you shouldn't be considerate of me.</b>

361
00:27:00,435 --> 00:27:03,125
<b>I wasn't so considerate in the first place.</b>

362
00:27:03,772 --> 00:27:05,295
<b>See you.</b>

363
00:27:11,947 --> 00:27:12,910
<b>Min-jeong.</b>

364
00:27:12,914 --> 00:27:14,235
<b>Yes?</b>

365
00:27:15,951 --> 00:27:17,135
<b>Let's</b>

366
00:27:21,156 --> 00:27:22,675
<b>get a new pick-up helper.</b>

367
00:27:32,701 --> 00:27:36,025
<b>You darn exorcist. You'd better stay away from us.</b>

368
00:27:40,542 --> 00:27:41,895
<b>Good.</b>

369
00:27:47,149 --> 00:27:48,735
<b>Seo-woo.</b>

370
00:27:49,451 --> 00:27:52,420
<b>What are you doing here at this hour?</b>

371
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:55,920
<b>I was out taking a walk.</b>

372
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:58,620
<b>I happened to be passing by, so I thought I'd walk with you.</b>

373
00:27:58,627 --> 00:28:00,675
<b>Okay. Come with us.</b>

374
00:28:01,196 --> 00:28:03,915
<b>Let's go Seo-woo.</b>

375
00:28:10,706 --> 00:28:12,870
<b>Seo-woo, you look even prettier today.</b>

376
00:28:12,874 --> 00:28:15,270
<b>I don't think you like all kids.</b>

377
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:16,610
<b>What?</b>

378
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:18,110
<b>You care only for Seo-woo.</b>

379
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:20,140
<b>Oh, well...</b>

380
00:28:20,148 --> 00:28:22,605
<b>I do like many kids.</b>

381
00:28:22,751 --> 00:28:25,675
<b>Seo-woo is just adorable.</b>

382
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:31,205
<b>Isn't it that you want to be a mom?</b>

383
00:28:32,661 --> 00:28:35,060
<b>What? Mom?</b>

384
00:28:35,063 --> 00:28:37,115
<b>Why are you so surprised?</b>

385
00:28:37,265 --> 00:28:39,900
<b>If you like a kid of her age,</b>

386
00:28:39,901 --> 00:28:41,515
<b>it means you want to get married.</b>

387
00:28:42,437 --> 00:28:44,600
<b>Oh, I see.</b>

388
00:28:44,606 --> 00:28:46,925
<b>You're not married yet.</b>

389
00:28:48,577 --> 00:28:50,095
<b>Yu-ri.</b>

390
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,975
<b>Seo-woo, it's okay.</b>

391
00:29:01,189 --> 00:29:02,805
<b>It's been fine these days.</b>

392
00:29:06,728 --> 00:29:08,245
<b>Are you all right?</b>

393
00:29:09,431 --> 00:29:11,330
<b>It's strange,</b>

394
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:14,285
<b>but dogs used to bark at Seo-woo until not long ago.</b>

395
00:29:17,739 --> 00:29:19,640
<b>Stop it. Seo-woo is terrified.</b>

396
00:29:19,641 --> 00:29:21,355
<b>Go away!</b>

397
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:23,825
<b>Stay quiet! My gosh.</b>

398
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:25,965
<b>Stop!</b>

399
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,975
<b>But that doesn't happen anymore.</b>

400
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:34,335
<b>Is it because she got bigger?</b>

401
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:49,030
<b>I just realized something amazing, Dad.</b>

402
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:51,525
<b>Something amazing? What?</b>

403
00:29:52,174 --> 00:29:55,525
<b>Popo is a genius dog.</b>

404
00:29:56,511 --> 00:29:58,140
<b>-All of a sudden? -Think about it.</b>

405
00:29:58,146 --> 00:30:00,210
<b>It barks at everyone but our family.</b>

406
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:03,605
<b>It even barks at the delivery guy who comes every day.</b>

407
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:08,645
<b>But it didn't bark at Yu-ri even once.</b>

408
00:30:09,691 --> 00:30:11,245
<b>You're right.</b>

409
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,975
<b>Come to think of it,</b>

410
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:16,990
<b>we brought Popo after Yu-ri left. Popo didn't see her before.</b>

411
00:30:16,998 --> 00:30:18,830
<b>My point.</b>

412
00:30:18,834 --> 00:30:21,485
<b>It knows that she's our family.</b>

413
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:24,870
<b>Isn't it genius? Do you think it should be on TV?</b>

414
00:30:24,873 --> 00:30:26,755
<b>-Make a call. -Okay.</b>

415
00:30:27,976 --> 00:30:30,065
<b>It's unbelievable.</b>

416
00:31:22,497 --> 00:31:23,945
<b>Honey.</b>

417
00:31:26,601 --> 00:31:28,385
<b>About Yu-ri.</b>

418
00:31:29,337 --> 00:31:33,455
<b>Don't you think she needs to see Seo-woo once?</b>

419
00:31:36,945 --> 00:31:39,610
<b>Don't worry. She's been seeing Seo-woo already.</b>

420
00:31:39,614 --> 00:31:41,780
<b>Did she see her? When?</b>

421
00:31:41,783 --> 00:31:43,805
<b>Did Gang-hwa let her meet Seo-woo?</b>

422
00:31:46,021 --> 00:31:47,805
<b>I'm glad to hear that.</b>

423
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,505
<b>No.</b>

424
00:31:51,293 --> 00:31:53,345
<b>Is it a good thing?</b>

425
00:31:57,265 --> 00:32:01,355
<b>She must've been devastated to see Seo-woo.</b>

426
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:05,770
<b>Now that Yu-ri's back,</b>

427
00:32:05,774 --> 00:32:07,600
<b>don't you think we should bring Seo-woo back?</b>

428
00:32:07,609 --> 00:32:10,195
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

429
00:32:10,278 --> 00:32:12,880
<b>It's not like she's a thing. Why would we bring her back?</b>

430
00:32:12,881 --> 00:32:16,910
<b>I mean, Dad and you want to see her too.</b>

431
00:32:16,918 --> 00:32:18,065
<b>Forget it.</b>

432
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,280
<b>I can't tell a six-year-old kid</b>

433
00:32:20,288 --> 00:32:23,345
<b>that Yu-ri is her real mom just because of my greed.</b>

434
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:28,275
<b>There is no end to the greed of people.</b>

435
00:32:33,168 --> 00:32:35,825
<b>I know she misses Seo-woo too.</b>

436
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:42,010
<b>I'll walk fast and get there before you.</b>

437
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:43,940
<b>I'll win. I'll be the winner.</b>

438
00:32:43,945 --> 00:32:45,640
<b>I'm winning.</b>

439
00:32:45,647 --> 00:32:47,610
<b>-Hyeon-jeong. -I'll walk faster than...</b>

440
00:32:47,615 --> 00:32:50,235
<b>-Hyeon-jeong. -Hyeon-jeong.</b>

441
00:32:52,354 --> 00:32:54,520
<b>-Hello, Seo-woo. -You were like this earlier.</b>

442
00:32:54,522 --> 00:32:57,150
<b>It sounds like you've never called your friend before.</b>

443
00:32:57,158 --> 00:32:58,820
<b>It sounds really awkward.</b>

444
00:32:58,827 --> 00:33:00,190
<b>What did I do?</b>

445
00:33:00,195 --> 00:33:03,390
<b>Hyeon-jeong. It's not awkward at all.</b>

446
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:06,500
<b>Hyeon-jeong, let's just go.</b>

447
00:33:06,501 --> 00:33:08,330
<b>-Okay. Let's go. -Okay.</b>

448
00:33:08,336 --> 00:33:10,025
<b>-Let's go, Min-jeong. -Okay.</b>

449
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:13,455
<b>It did sound awkward though.</b>

450
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:16,465
<b>Okay.</b>

451
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:19,080
<b>-This is all your fault. -What did I do?</b>

452
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,240
<b>Now I understand</b>

453
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:23,365
<b>a stray cat that lost a fight.</b>

454
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:25,780
<b>-Hey. -Why would you take it out on me?</b>

455
00:33:25,787 --> 00:33:29,005
<b>I don't know. Let's just go.</b>

456
00:33:37,899 --> 00:33:40,055
<b>It's really strange.</b>

457
00:33:40,068 --> 00:33:42,070
<b>How did Yu-ri know that?</b>

458
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:43,825
<b>I don't know.</b>

459
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:45,640
<b>She said she just got the feeling.</b>

460
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:48,370
<b>Feeling? What feeling? Is she a detective or what?</b>

461
00:33:48,376 --> 00:33:51,880
<b>What could she feel? Even a doctor wouldn't know that without a closer look.</b>

462
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,635
<b>My point.</b>

463
00:33:54,716 --> 00:33:56,810
<b>I'm sure she's hiding something.</b>

464
00:33:56,818 --> 00:33:59,180
<b>Everything is so strange.</b>

465
00:33:59,187 --> 00:34:01,450
<b>You knew all along that she was strange.</b>

466
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:04,120
<b>It was strange that Yu-ri asked you to stay quiet for 49 days.</b>

467
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:06,915
<b>And it was strange that she knew about Min-jeong.</b>

468
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:10,915
<b>Don't sigh.</b>

469
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:12,730
<b>Please stop sighing.</b>

470
00:34:12,734 --> 00:34:15,530
<b>I didn't sleep a wink because of that sigh.</b>

471
00:34:15,537 --> 00:34:17,085
<b>Why?</b>

472
00:34:17,405 --> 00:34:20,555
<b>Is it about Hyeon-jeong? Hey, did she say anything?</b>

473
00:34:20,775 --> 00:34:22,265
<b>Hey.</b>

474
00:34:22,744 --> 00:34:24,995
<b>Hyeon-jeong didn't say anything.</b>

475
00:34:25,613 --> 00:34:27,135
<b>But...</b>

476

00:47:25,559 --> 00:47:27,890
<b>Wow, impressive.</b>

638
00:47:27,895 --> 00:47:29,120
<b>Do you have a second?</b>

639
00:47:29,129 --> 00:47:30,430
<b>Can you take a look?</b>

640
00:47:30,431 --> 00:47:33,485
<b><i>But the reality was completely different from what I had imagined.</i></b>

641
00:47:33,734 --> 00:47:35,130
<b><i>My coworkers were mean.</i></b>

642
00:47:35,135 --> 00:47:36,585
<b>Hello.</b>

643
00:47:36,604 --> 00:47:39,070
<b>I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.</b>

644
00:47:39,073 --> 00:47:40,825
<b>My bad.</b>

645
00:47:42,643 --> 00:47:44,765
<b><i>I couldn't stand it.</i></b>

646
00:47:45,145 --> 00:47:47,995
<b><i>I was lost and couldn't seem to fit in.</i></b>

647

<b><i>I became an outcast.</i></b>

648

<b><i>In the end...</i></b>

649
00:47:55,623 --> 00:47:57,145
<b>But the thing is,</b>

650
00:47:59,927 --> 00:48:02,575
<b>the moment I killed myself, I regretted it.</b>

651
00:48:27,521 --> 00:48:30,705
<b>Mom, I'm sorry.</b>

652
00:48:34,862 --> 00:48:36,385
<b>My dream</b>

653

00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:48,695
<b>I had them in my life too.</b>

656
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:51,325
<b>I thought my dream was all I had.</b>

657
00:48:56,517 --> 00:49:00,035
<b>Why do people always regret things when it's too late?</b>

658
00:49:00,321 --> 00:49:01,720
<b>Are we idiots?</b>

659
00:49:01,722 --> 00:49:04,475
<b>If we only did things we'd never regret,</b>

660

<b>Can you babysit her for a moment? No.</b>

670
00:50:52,332 --> 00:50:55,985
<b>Actually, I might be a while.</b>

671

<b>My sweet girl.</b>

<b>Come here, sweetie.</b>

679
00:52:20,087 --> 00:52:21,480
<b>What's going on?</b>

680
00:52:21,488 --> 00:52:23,220
<b>What is Seo-woo doing here?</b>

681
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:26,420
<b>-Gang-hwa asked us to babysit her. -Really?</b>

682
00:52:26,426 --> 00:52:28,490
<b>-Yes. -Seriously?</b>

683
00:52:28,495 --> 00:52:29,930
<b>Why didn't you wake me up?</b>

684
00:52:29,930 --> 00:52:31,890
<b>She'll be here for a while.</b>

<b>She's all yours.</b>

00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:35,360
<b>Really? She's all mine?</b>

687
00:52:35,369 --> 00:52:37,630
<b>Seo-woo, do you want some apples?</b>

688
00:52:37,638 --> 00:52:40,270
<b>Here. Good girl.</b>

689
00:52:40,274 --> 00:52:42,055
<b>Chew it carefully.</b>

690
00:52:42,342 --> 00:52:43,440
<b>Does it taste good?</b>

691
00:52:43,443 --> 00:52:46,780
<b>Seo-woo, we've met before, right?</b>

692
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:49,035
<b>You remember it, right?</b>

693
00:52:49,616 --> 00:52:51,805
<b>-Give her some tangerines too. -Okay.</b>

694
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:54,920
<b>Here you go. You don't want it?</b>

695
00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:57,075
<b>Should I eat it then?</b>

696
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:01,775
<b>You don't like tangerines?</b>

697
00:53:02,796 --> 00:53:04,390
<b>Do you want more apples?</b>

698
00:53:04,398 --> 00:53:05,960
<b>-Eat more apples. -Yes.</b>

699
00:53:05,966 --> 00:53:07,785
<b>Do you want to finish this?</b>

700
00:53:10,070 --> 00:53:12,985
<b>It seems like you don't like tangerines.</b>

701
00:53:13,473 --> 00:53:15,900
<b>You don't want any tangerines? Should Auntie eat all of them?</b>

702
00:53:15,909 --> 00:53:17,910
<b>You can't give her such a big piece.</b>

703
00:53:17,911 --> 00:53:19,465
<b>I'll eat it.</b>

704
00:53:30,090 --> 00:53:32,390
<b>Here are two grapefruit juices.</b>

705
00:53:32,392 --> 00:53:34,075
<b>Thank you.</b>

706
00:53:36,396 --> 00:53:38,445
<b>You did a nice thing.</b>

707
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:41,855
<b>With Yu-ri back, Ms. Jeon can finally see Seo-woo too.</b>

708
00:53:41,902 --> 00:53:44,185
<b>She must have wanted to see Seo-woo so badly.</b>

709
00:53:44,238 --> 00:53:46,170
<b>I told Min-jeong we're taking the kids somewhere.</b>

710
00:53:46,173 --> 00:53:47,400
<b>Make sure Hyeon-jeong knows.</b>

711
00:53:47,407 --> 00:53:49,495
<b>O, K. Okay.</b>

712
00:53:51,111 --> 00:53:52,825
<b>T, Y.</b>

713
00:53:54,681 --> 00:53:57,150
<b>"T, Y"? Is that a swear word?</b>

714
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:58,850
<b>Why would "T, Y" be a swear word?</b>

715
00:53:58,852 --> 00:54:00,605
<b>What does it mean?</b>

716
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:03,605
<b>Yes, it is a swear word.</b>

717
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:08,315
<b>What is this?</b>

718
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:12,485
<b>I'm not cheating on my wife, but I'm still lying to her. Gosh.</b>

719
00:54:12,866 --> 00:54:15,360
<b>If you think of Min-jeong and Yu-ri separately,</b>

720
00:54:15,369 --> 00:54:17,955
<b>there's nothing morally wrong with it.</b>

721
00:54:18,171 --> 00:54:19,640
<b>You're not cheating on anyone.</b>

722
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:22,555
<b>If you think about it, both of them are your wives.</b>

723
00:54:25,045 --> 00:54:27,065
<b>Still, that's what it looks like.</b>

724
00:54:27,547 --> 00:54:29,510
<b>-What? -It sounds like you are cheating on her.</b>

725
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:31,065
<b>Gosh.</b>

726
00:54:39,126 --> 00:54:40,275
<b>What are you doing?</b>

727
00:54:41,428 --> 00:54:43,585
<b>I can't get the grapefruits out.</b>

728
00:54:48,802 --> 00:54:50,155
<b>Oh.</b>

729
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:55,695
<b>How did you get into medical school?</b>

730
00:55:00,647 --> 00:55:01,895
<b>It's so fresh.</b>

731
00:55:02,149 --> 00:55:03,480
<b>You're smart.</b>

732
00:55:03,483 --> 00:55:06,365
<b>-And you look like a cheater. -Gosh, come on.</b>

733
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:09,205
<b>-See you. -Bye.</b>

734
00:55:13,193 --> 00:55:15,345
<b>You're so excited. Are you happy?</b>

735
00:55:16,763 --> 00:55:18,830
<b>You went grocery shopping?</b>

736
00:55:18,832 --> 00:55:22,100
<b>Yes. What is Ha-jun doing here?</b>

737
00:55:22,102 --> 00:55:24,585
<b>What? Well...</b>

738
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:27,370
<b>He's been clinging to me all day.</b>

739
00:55:27,374 --> 00:55:28,740
<b>Is Seo-woo at home?</b>

740
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:30,265
<b>Pardon?</b>

741
00:55:30,777 --> 00:55:33,225
<b>Well, yes.</b>

742
00:55:35,082 --> 00:55:36,180
<b>Seo-woo, sit here.</b>

743
00:55:36,183 --> 00:55:37,710
<b>Why don't you pack a lunch?</b>

744
00:55:37,718 --> 00:55:39,865
<b>Are you going to eat out?</b>

745
00:55:39,886 --> 00:55:41,080
<b>Well, don't worry.</b>

746
00:55:41,088 --> 00:55:44,705
<b>Geun-sang is packing lunch for us too.</b>

747
00:55:45,859 --> 00:55:49,275
<b>Seo-woo, you must be excited to spend the day with Ha-jun.</b>

<b>Next time, let's all go together.</b>

749
00:55:52,632 --> 00:55:54,155

<b>Hi, Seo-woo. Did you have fun?</b>

756
00:56:56,897 --> 00:56:59,045
<b>She could have stayed longer.</b>

757
00:56:59,332 --> 00:57:01,055
<b>No, we're fine.</b>

758
00:57:01,067 --> 00:57:03,155
<b>Min-jeong must be waiting.</b>

759
00:57:06,273 --> 00:57:07,755
<b>How are your parents?</b>

760
00:57:08,008 --> 00:57:10,625
<b>They're happy. Very happy.</b>

761
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:14,865
<b>That's good.</b>

762
00:57:15,215 --> 00:57:16,695
<b>That's really good.</b>

763
00:57:19,553 --> 00:57:22,335
<b>Seo-woo, let's go home now.</b>

764

<b>Well. Don't stop by anywhere.</b>

765

00:57:28,161 --> 00:57:31,215
<b>Hold Seo-woo's hand at all times. Be careful.</b>

<b>Okay?</b>

768
00:57:33,467 --> 00:57:36,055
<b>Sure, of course.</b>

769
00:57:38,071 --> 00:57:39,425
<b>It's cold. Go inside.</b>

770

<b><i>Where are you?</i></b>

01:00:01,715 --> 01:00:03,365
<b>I said, who are you?</b>

778
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:10,035
<b>I'm Yu-ri's friend.</b>

<b>What?</b>

780

<b>You woke up, and you were at a charnel house?</b>

<b>I remember that I died.</b>

<b>She says I'm nice. Isn't that weird?</b>

784

<b>Yu-ri said that? How would she know?</b>

785

<b>It's not easy to know that if you aren't close.</b>
