1
00:00:21,038 --> 00:00:22,279
<b>What's this?</b>

2
00:00:22,348 --> 00:00:24,619
<b>This was to be delivered
to the meeting room.</b>

3
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:55,009
<b>(It's you this time.)</b>

4
00:00:55,308 --> 00:00:57,149
<b>"It's you this time."</b>

5
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:05,395
<b>What does this mean?</b>

6
00:01:05,419 --> 00:01:06,835
<b>Are you asking me?</b>

7
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:08,305
<b>You called this meeting today.</b>

8
00:01:08,329 --> 00:01:09,934
<b>And the flowers were delivered here.</b>

9
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:11,475
<b>What do they have to do with one another?</b>

10
00:01:11,499 --> 00:01:12,699
<b>I'm sure you're aware.</b>

11
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:16,898
<b>Choi Kyung Man, Seo Yeon Soo,
and Cha Jeung Seok.</b>

12
00:01:17,169 --> 00:01:18,499
<b>All three of them...</b>

13
00:01:18,568 --> 00:01:20,398
<b>received flowers right before they died.</b>

14
00:01:20,999 --> 00:01:22,639
<b>Is that a new rule?</b>

15
00:01:23,368 --> 00:01:24,954
<b>Is someone sending flowers...</b>

16
00:01:24,978 --> 00:01:27,139
<b>and then killing people?</b>

17
00:01:28,148 --> 00:01:30,484
<b>Ms. Seo Yeon Soo fell to her death,</b>

18
00:01:30,508 --> 00:01:32,025
<b>Mr. Choi Kyung Man had a heart attack,</b>

19
00:01:32,049 --> 00:01:34,118
<b>and I thought Mr. Cha Jeung
Seok committed suicide.</b>

20
00:01:35,588 --> 00:01:38,258
<b>Shouldn't we find out
who this message is from?</b>

21
00:01:39,919 --> 00:01:41,928
<b>According to the rule,
one of us will die...</b>

22
00:01:42,988 --> 00:01:44,928
<b>in a few days.</b>

23
00:01:47,128 --> 00:01:48,529
<b>In that case,</b>

24
00:01:49,098 --> 00:01:51,128
<b>I'm sure this card is targeting me.</b>

25
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:54,708
<b>This is my house and workplace.</b>

26
00:01:58,478 --> 00:01:59,579
<b>No.</b>

27
00:02:00,878 --> 00:02:02,779
<b>This time, I'll die.</b>

28
00:02:03,809 --> 00:02:05,818
<b>I saw the flowers first.</b>

29
00:02:07,378 --> 00:02:09,389
<b>This is the curse of the reset.</b>

30
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:12,458
<b>Four people died already!</b>

31
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:14,688
<b>I'm going to die...</b>

32
00:02:14,889 --> 00:02:16,428
<b>like everyone else who got flowers.</b>

33
00:02:16,528 --> 00:02:18,658
<b>I'm going to die next!</b>

34
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:22,245
<b>Se Rin!</b>

35
00:02:22,269 --> 00:02:24,199
<b>- Se Rin!
- Se Rin.</b>

36
00:02:25,738 --> 00:02:27,039
<b>Se Rin, open your eyes.</b>

37
00:02:30,139 --> 00:02:31,938
<b>This is the number of the delivery company.</b>

38
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:36,849
<b>I can't ask the officials to
conduct an official investigation,</b>

39
00:02:36,979 --> 00:02:39,099
<b>so I want to ask you to look into this,
Detective Ji.</b>

40
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:43,118
<b>I want to know who's
putting on a prank like this.</b>

41
00:02:43,648 --> 00:02:45,534
<b>I'm as curious as you are.</b>

42
00:02:45,558 --> 00:02:46,889
<b>I'm sure...</b>

43
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:50,088
<b>it's someone who knows about the reset.</b>

44
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:52,928
<b>Someone who knew that
we'll be gathered here today.</b>

45
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:56,669
<b>We already lost 4 people among 11.</b>

46
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:00,438
<b>Is there a possibility that
someone else other than us...</b>

47
00:03:00,898 --> 00:03:03,069
<b>- knows about the reset?
- As far as I'm concerned,</b>

48
00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:04,539
<b>no.</b>

49
00:03:05,539 --> 00:03:07,808
<b>But I have no way of knowing...</b>

50
00:03:07,949 --> 00:03:10,908
<b>if one of you told someone else.</b>

51
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:13,178
<b>It could also be one
of the late individuals.</b>

52
00:03:14,379 --> 00:03:17,688
<b>I'd like you to consider
all the possibilities.</b>

53
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:20,688
<b>If you ever need my help,
feel free to contact me.</b>

54
00:03:29,468 --> 00:03:30,528
<b>I'll call you.</b>

55
00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:40,238
<b>(Episode 9)</b>

56
00:04:04,738 --> 00:04:06,398
<b>He gave this to you?</b>

57
00:04:06,868 --> 00:04:09,069
<b>Was it not Ms. Lee Shin
who sent the flowers?</b>

58
00:04:09,468 --> 00:04:12,238
<b>That means she's in
danger just like the rest of us.</b>

59
00:04:13,308 --> 00:04:14,778
<b>It could be a ruse.</b>

60
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:17,949
<b>How's Se Rin doing? Did
you call an ambulance?</b>

61
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:20,495
<b>Yes, Mr. Hwang went with her.</b>

62
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,588
<b>You must enjoy playing detective.</b>

63
00:04:23,048 --> 00:04:25,189
<b>Was your webtoon not enough?</b>

64
00:04:25,718 --> 00:04:27,458
<b>The plot was quite intriguing.</b>

65
00:04:28,358 --> 00:04:29,358
<b>You better behave...</b>

66
00:04:29,658 --> 00:04:31,829
<b>before I lock you up for illegal filming.</b>

67
00:04:31,858 --> 00:04:33,958
<b>How will you get the arrest warrant?</b>

68
00:04:34,329 --> 00:04:36,728
<b>Will you say that I secretly
filmed those I reset with?</b>

69
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:39,098
<b>I'm sure the prosecutor will believe you.</b>

70
00:04:40,398 --> 00:04:42,038
<b>Mr. Cha Jeung Seok...</b>

71
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:44,069
<b>When was the last time you saw him?</b>

72
00:04:44,239 --> 00:04:46,108
<b>Are you suspecting me of murdering him?</b>

73
00:04:47,778 --> 00:04:51,278
<b>I'm also sad that he died.</b>

74
00:04:51,478 --> 00:04:54,379
<b>He died before I could
take more of his money.</b>

75
00:04:54,788 --> 00:04:56,588
<b>It's upsetting for me as well.</b>

76
00:04:56,718 --> 00:04:59,418
<b>Do you really have nothing
to do with the bouquets?</b>

77
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:06,158
<b>That means you're in danger as well.</b>

78
00:05:08,098 --> 00:05:11,168
<b>Think about it. Did you notice
anything strange while spying on us?</b>

79
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:12,975
<b>Did you ever see anyone deliver bouquets...</b>

80
00:05:12,999 --> 00:05:14,369
<b>or spot anyone suspicious?</b>

81
00:05:14,809 --> 00:05:18,038
<b>I won't tell you that for free.</b>

82
00:05:18,608 --> 00:05:19,679
<b>Okay?</b>

83
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:23,278
<b>If you need information from me,
give me something in exchange.</b>

84
00:05:26,278 --> 00:05:27,978
<b>Have fun playing cops.</b>

85
00:05:44,999 --> 00:05:47,079
<b>What do you think is the
meaning behind the flowers?</b>

86
00:05:47,338 --> 00:05:50,338
<b>Do you think a killer exists
and they're the ones who sent it?</b>

87
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:53,514
<b>I'm not sure. If there
truly was a killer...</b>

88
00:05:53,538 --> 00:05:55,254
<b>and they were trying
to hide their killings,</b>

89
00:05:55,278 --> 00:05:58,148
<b>why would they send the
flowers and leave evidence?</b>

90
00:05:59,379 --> 00:06:00,478
<b>Let's go for now.</b>

91
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:02,848
<b>I'll go on my own.</b>

92
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:04,689
<b>I'm suspecting something.</b>

93
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:05,889
<b>What is it?</b>

94
00:06:07,358 --> 00:06:09,788
<b>I'll let you know after I verify it.</b>

95
00:06:18,538 --> 00:06:20,439
<b>Please look into this matter.</b>

96
00:06:22,069 --> 00:06:24,509
<b>I thought you had already
asked Det. Ji for help.</b>

97
00:06:27,538 --> 00:06:29,478
<b>He's suspecting me the most.</b>

98
00:06:30,148 --> 00:06:32,048
<b>He won't tell me that easily.</b>

99
00:06:33,348 --> 00:06:34,348
<b>So please look into it.</b>

100
00:06:35,088 --> 00:06:36,148
<b>Yes, ma'am.</b>

101
00:06:41,019 --> 00:06:43,158
<b>At 2:30pm...</b>

102
00:06:43,629 --> 00:06:44,869
<b>Mr. Kwon Ho Jun delivered them.</b>

103
00:06:46,228 --> 00:06:47,598
<b>There he is.</b>

104
00:06:50,298 --> 00:06:51,369
<b>Excuse me.</b>

105
00:06:51,668 --> 00:06:53,939
<b>Did you deliver a bouquet
to Zian Clinic today?</b>

106
00:06:56,239 --> 00:06:57,269
<b>Yes.</b>

107
00:06:57,908 --> 00:06:59,908
<b>The bouquet is on a park bench.</b>

108
00:07:00,009 --> 00:07:02,009
<b>Once you find it, please send me a photo.</b>

109
00:07:02,148 --> 00:07:04,579
<b>Please deliver it by 2:30pm.</b>

110
00:07:04,608 --> 00:07:06,478
<b>Make sure you're on time.</b>

111
00:07:06,619 --> 00:07:07,718
<b>So...</b>

112
00:07:08,218 --> 00:07:11,088
<b>you found the bouquet but not the sender?</b>

113
00:07:11,689 --> 00:07:14,418
<b>No. Something felt off at first.</b>

114
00:07:14,588 --> 00:07:17,764
<b>But it was just a bouquet,
and I was getting paid a lot for it.</b>

115
00:07:17,788 --> 00:07:19,228
<b>So I didn't think too much about it.</b>

116
00:07:21,329 --> 00:07:23,598
<b>May I check the messages?</b>

117
00:07:23,829 --> 00:07:24,939
<b>Sure.</b>

118
00:07:26,069 --> 00:07:29,168
<b>(I found it. It'll be delivered by 2:30pm.)</b>

119
00:07:31,739 --> 00:07:33,439
<b>- May I call the number?
- Sure.</b>

120
00:07:36,249 --> 00:07:38,949
<b>The number you have dialed does not exist.</b>

121
00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:41,548
<b>Please check again.</b>

122
00:07:46,389 --> 00:07:48,559
<b>Ma'am, are you in?</b>

123

<b>(It's you this time.)</b>

<b>We don't have them here.</b>

<b>They're high-maintenance and expensive.</b>

132

<b>You'll probably have to go...</b>

133

00:30:01,069 --> 00:30:03,414
<b>Out of all places,
the flower shop was around your cafe.</b>

461
00:30:03,438 --> 00:30:05,709
<b>So even you were suspected.</b>

462
00:30:05,909 --> 00:30:07,385
<b>My goodness.</b>

463
00:30:07,409 --> 00:30:09,479
<b>Why would Ko Jae Young do such a thing?</b>

464
00:30:10,379 --> 00:30:11,985
<b>He must have thought...</b>

465
00:30:12,009 --> 00:30:14,448
<b>that he was able to find the
real sender of the flowers.</b>

466
00:30:15,019 --> 00:30:18,064
<b>He was trying to get clues in his own way.</b>

467
00:30:18,088 --> 00:30:20,635
<b>If he had time for that,
he should've helped the detective.</b>

468
00:30:20,659 --> 00:30:22,929
<b>I don't think he's useful at all.</b>

469
00:30:24,188 --> 00:30:27,798
<b>Well, there was this message on the note.</b>

470
00:30:27,898 --> 00:30:30,698
<b>Do you recognize these lines at all?</b>

471
00:30:31,428 --> 00:30:32,768
<b>What is that?</b>

472
00:30:33,898 --> 00:30:36,509
<b>There was a note in
the bouquets of flowers?</b>

473
00:30:37,539 --> 00:30:39,815
<b>They sound like they
might be lines from poems.</b>

474
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:42,138
<b>Or just common celebratory messages.</b>

475
00:30:43,048 --> 00:30:47,424
<b>But I don't think these
lines are connected.</b>

476
00:30:47,448 --> 00:30:48,678
<b>What does that mean?</b>

477
00:31:01,798 --> 00:31:02,868
<b>Did you find what I asked?</b>

478
00:31:03,368 --> 00:31:06,029
<b>Do you think finding someone is that easy?</b>

479
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:08,798
<b>Then, why did you want to see me?</b>

480
00:31:09,099 --> 00:31:10,114
<b>Do you want more money?</b>

481
00:31:10,138 --> 00:31:12,738
<b>If you want to expedite it,
you should pay me extra.</b>

482
00:31:14,509 --> 00:31:16,039
<b>You know the bouquet of flowers?</b>

483
00:31:26,689 --> 00:31:29,319
<b>Is it true that people got
the bouquet of flowers...</b>

484
00:31:29,789 --> 00:31:31,089
<b>before they died?</b>

485
00:31:32,828 --> 00:31:34,529
<b>I thought you were the one who sent them.</b>

486
00:31:35,198 --> 00:31:36,674
<b>You're the only one left now.</b>

487
00:31:36,698 --> 00:31:40,138
<b>How could anyone kill
people just by sending flowers?</b>

488
00:31:40,868 --> 00:31:43,439
<b>Did you hear anything
from that detective guy?</b>

489
00:31:43,868 --> 00:31:45,638
<b>I guess you're scared of death too.</b>

490
00:31:46,578 --> 00:31:48,379
<b>It's not your turn, so don't worry.</b>

491
00:31:51,208 --> 00:31:52,855
<b>How do you know that?</b>

492
00:31:52,879 --> 00:31:55,048
<b>If you're curious,
take care of what I asked fast.</b>

493

<b>(- Did he figure it out?
- The culprit must be really smart.)</b>

496

<b>The culprit is the manager, the bookworm.</b>

<b>Yes. Why?</b>

544

<b>Right, about the messages, I found a lead.</b>

<b>No, we'll go as planned.</b>

<b>("Pieces of Destiny")</b>

<b>You're right. But there's more.</b>

552

<b>The drawings.</b>

553
00:36:35,358 --> 00:36:36,974

<b>- be in your garden.
- be in your garden.</b>

<b>He committed suicide.</b>

570
00:37:16,339 --> 00:37:17,608
<b>This is plausible.</b>

571
00:37:19,939 --> 00:37:23,408
<b>But the bouquets were
delivered before they died.</b>

572
00:37:23,849 --> 00:37:26,049
<b>It doesn't make sense

838
00:53:08,859 --> 00:53:10,659
<b>He definitely met up with the ex-convict.</b>

<b>That man knows nothing

<b>Prove it, then.</b>

858
00:54:33,669 --> 00:54:36,109
<b>I thought we settled everything last time.</b>

859
00:54:36,508 --> 00:54:39,179
<b>Yes, I thought we did.</b>

860
