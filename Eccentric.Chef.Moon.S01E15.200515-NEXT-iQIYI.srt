<b>I lost everything because of you,</b>

7

<b>if you pulled a fraud to steal a company,</b>

12
00:00:47,545 --> 00:00:49,274
<b>then you should've made sure to hide it.</b>

<b>[ How embarrassing is this? ]</b>

<b>I was on the phone with him

<b>Were you behind Lim Hyun-a's incident?</b>

29

<b>[ No, that's not true. ]</b>

33

<b>Lim Chul-yong did it.</b>

40

<b>20 years ago,
Lim Chul-yong committed the murder</b>

<b>and covered it up as an accident.</b>

42

<b>[ Actually, I went there that day
to tell you the truth about her death. ]</b>

44

<b>But when I saw you smile
so brightly there,</b>

45
00:02:40,555 --> 00:02:42,450
<b>I just couldn't bring myself
to tell you the truth.</b>

<b>[ Things are already tough

47
00:02:44,855 --> 00:02:46,660
<b>[ I didn't want to make you suffer more. ]</b>

48

<b>[ I couldn't gather up my courage. ]</b>

<b>Find her and bring her to me now.</b>

51
00:03:14,285 --> 00:03:17,990
<b>And I want you to look into everyone</b>

53
00:03:21,725 --> 00:03:23,230
<b>Don't leave out anyone.</b>

54
00:03:25,795 --> 00:03:27,730
<b>- Now!
- Yes, sir.</b>

55
00:03:41,215 --> 00:03:43,554
<b>I already put in a good word

56
00:03:43,555 --> 00:03:45,880
<b>Once you get there,
you'll have a job waiting for you.</b>

57
00:03:47,485 --> 00:03:49,780
<b>Thank you for looking out for me.</b>

58
00:03:50,795 --> 00:03:51,890
<b>Ms. Seo.</b>

<b>Can you tell me

60

<b>She ended up getting
transported to the hospital.</b>

61
00:03:59,195 --> 00:04:00,700
<b>She brought it upon herself.</b>

62
00:04:01,235 --> 00:04:03,130
<b>[ Then, goodbye. ]</b>

63
00:04:21,535 --> 00:04:23,130
<b>Let me say this again.</b>

64
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:27,710
<b>I'm not going to Mr. Kang or Ms. Han</b>

65
00:04:29,345 --> 00:04:30,540
<b>because they will</b>

66
00:04:31,485 --> 00:04:35,680
<b>only use me to bring down Mr. Lim.</b>

67
00:04:37,225 --> 00:04:38,880
<b>They will never protect me.</b>

68
00:04:39,995 --> 00:04:41,120
<b>So</b>

69
00:04:42,195 --> 00:04:44,120
<b>don't sell me out to them.</b>

70
00:04:50,465 --> 00:04:51,760
<b>Don't get out.</b>

71
00:04:54,935 --> 00:04:58,300
<b>I'll let you know once I have proof.</b>

72
00:05:25,735 --> 00:05:26,870
<b>Yu-jin!</b>

73
00:05:30,745 --> 00:05:32,170
<b>What brings you here?</b>

74
00:05:34,145 --> 00:05:35,610
<b>Why didn't you tell me?</b>

75
00:05:36,075 --> 00:05:37,210
<b>What?</b>

76
00:05:37,885 --> 00:05:39,140
<b>About my mom.</b>

77
00:05:44,485 --> 00:05:47,190
<b>- I must go see Lim Chul-yong.
- What will you do?</b>

78
00:05:49,755 --> 00:05:51,160
<b>I'm going to kill him.</b>

79
00:05:53,435 --> 00:05:55,060
<b>I was able to persuade Mr. Jung.</b>

80
00:05:59,034 --> 00:06:01,270
<b>I located Lim Chul-yong's right-hand man,
Mr. Jung,</b>

81
00:06:01,735 --> 00:06:03,129
<b>and was able to persuade him.</b>

82
00:06:08,575 --> 00:06:11,540
<b>If you go to him now,
you'll ruin everything.</b>

83
00:06:12,985 --> 00:06:16,350
<b>You must be patient right now
for you to take your revenge.</b>

84
00:06:19,485 --> 00:06:20,824
<b>[ Mr. Lim isn't in his office. ]</b>

85
00:06:20,825 --> 00:06:24,060
<b>[ Then, I'll wait in his office. ]</b>

86
00:06:24,825 --> 00:06:25,920
<b>[ Okay. ]</b>

87
00:06:51,925 --> 00:06:53,354
<b>[ You're here, sir. ]</b>

88
00:06:53,355 --> 00:06:55,720
<b>[ Mr. Jung is waiting for you inside. ]</b>

89
00:06:58,295 --> 00:07:00,790
<b>I'm going to meet
with Ms. Jang and Mr. Kang.</b>

90
00:07:03,034 --> 00:07:04,160
<b>Come with me.</b>

91
00:07:05,365 --> 00:07:08,374
<b>Her assistant worked on the design
to practice.</b>

92
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:10,770
<b>It has nothing to do with her show.</b>

93
00:07:10,945 --> 00:07:12,800
<b>My gosh, yes.</b>

94
00:07:13,575 --> 00:07:17,240
<b>Okay. Yes. I'm counting on you.</b>

95
00:07:17,585 --> 00:07:18,710
<b>Okay.</b>

96
00:07:22,115 --> 00:07:25,380
<b>Yes, Reporter Park. I see. Goodness.</b>

97
00:07:25,785 --> 00:07:28,120
<b>Well, you ought to help me out
in a time of a crisis.</b>

98
00:07:28,455 --> 00:07:30,390
<b>Yes. Okay.</b>

99
00:07:30,795 --> 00:07:32,520
<b>I see. Then, thank you for your help.</b>

100
00:07:37,335 --> 00:07:38,830
<b>You heard about Belle Ombre, right?</b>

101
00:07:39,705 --> 00:07:41,734
<b>The share price for Donghan International</b>

102
00:07:41,735 --> 00:07:44,170
<b>took a deep dive yesterday
because of Belle Ombre's incident.</b>

103
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:46,004
<b>Given the condition of Hyun-a,</b>

104
00:07:46,005 --> 00:07:48,540
<b>I don't think
anything good will come out of it.</b>

105
00:07:49,775 --> 00:07:53,810
<b>It has affected the company
and me, personally too much.</b>

106
00:07:56,784 --> 00:07:58,320
<b>That's why I must ask you</b>

107
00:08:00,925 --> 00:08:03,760
<b>to go down to Seoha Village.</b>

108
00:08:06,025 --> 00:08:08,960
<b>- Pardon?
- Moon Seung-mo and Yoo Yu-jin.</b>

109
00:08:11,605 --> 00:08:12,830
<b>Bring them to me.</b>

110
00:08:14,405 --> 00:08:17,670
<b>I must show them the consequence
of their attempt to bring me down.</b>

111
00:08:20,815 --> 00:08:23,170
<b>Why don't you return
as the managing director</b>

112
00:08:24,615 --> 00:08:26,010
<b>after you take care of that?</b>

113
00:08:27,955 --> 00:08:29,110
<b>Yes, sir.</b>

114
00:08:35,395 --> 00:08:36,720
<b>If you understood, leave.</b>

115
00:08:37,765 --> 00:08:38,860
<b>Yes, sir.</b>

116
00:08:40,095 --> 00:08:41,230
<b>Right.</b>

117
00:08:42,865 --> 00:08:44,460
<b>You must make a statement as a witness.</b>

118
00:08:44,534 --> 00:08:45,700
<b>Pardon? I see.</b>

119
00:08:47,335 --> 00:08:49,830
<b>- Okay.
- Since we're on the subject, do it soon.</b>

120
00:08:50,345 --> 00:08:52,170
<b>If you stall,
people will get the wrong idea.</b>

121
00:08:53,515 --> 00:08:55,010
<b>Yes, sir. I will.</b>

122
00:09:06,995 --> 00:09:08,290
<b>[ Mr. Jung? ]</b>

123
00:09:09,655 --> 00:09:11,460
<b>[ I can't trust him. ]</b>

124
00:09:12,925 --> 00:09:14,060
<b>I agree.</b>

125
00:09:14,195 --> 00:09:17,264
<b>If Mr. Lim tells him to die,
he'll even fake his own death.</b>

126
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:18,664
<b>He's one of his trusted people.</b>

127
00:09:18,665 --> 00:09:19,800
<b>He was</b>

128
00:09:20,535 --> 00:09:23,530
<b>scared that he might be
the next target after Mr. Jin.</b>

129
00:09:24,445 --> 00:09:26,970
<b>For now, we should believe in his fear.</b>

130
00:09:29,515 --> 00:09:32,710
<b>Lim Chul-yong called me last night.</b>

131
00:09:34,385 --> 00:09:38,120
<b>He already knew that Yu-jin
was staying at Pungcheonok.</b>

132
00:09:38,455 --> 00:09:39,580
<b>What?</b>

133
00:09:39,755 --> 00:09:41,620
<b>It's probably because of Lim Hyun-a.</b>

134
00:09:41,795 --> 00:09:44,324
<b>Unlike his usual self,
he got all worked up</b>

135
00:09:44,325 --> 00:09:45,820
<b>and threatened Yu-jin's life.</b>

136
00:09:46,965 --> 00:09:50,034
<b>I want her to stay with me
for the time being.</b>

137
00:09:50,035 --> 00:09:51,200
<b>No.</b>

138
00:09:51,865 --> 00:09:53,934
<b>That might put you in danger too.</b>

139
00:09:53,935 --> 00:09:55,100
<b>Yu-jin.</b>

140
00:09:57,975 --> 00:09:59,140
<b>Perhaps,</b>

141
00:10:00,275 --> 00:10:01,940
<b>this might be our chance.</b>

142
00:10:03,515 --> 00:10:06,410
<b>- Pardon?
- He's worked up unlike his usual self.</b>

143
00:10:07,255 --> 00:10:08,880
<b>It means he's feeling a lot of pressure.</b>

144
00:10:09,885 --> 00:10:11,180
<b>Let's put more pressure on him.</b>

145
00:10:11,185 --> 00:10:12,750
<b>[ That might give us a chance. ]</b>

146
00:10:12,855 --> 00:10:16,094
<b>Right. From what I observed today,
the share price</b>

147
00:10:16,095 --> 00:10:18,160
<b>for International plummeted
because of Belle Ombre.</b>

148
00:10:18,365 --> 00:10:20,860
<b>Why don't you meet with the shareholders?</b>

149
00:10:21,235 --> 00:10:22,430
<b>I'll do that.</b>

150
00:10:22,965 --> 00:10:24,300
<b>Then,</b>

151
00:10:25,735 --> 00:10:28,230
<b>I'll meet with Lim Hyun-a.</b>

152
00:10:28,435 --> 00:10:29,600
<b>Lim Hyun-a?</b>

153
00:10:29,975 --> 00:10:32,570
<b>She's his weak spot.</b>

154
00:10:35,345 --> 00:10:36,440
<b>Wait.</b>

155
00:10:37,615 --> 00:10:38,810
<b>Yes, Mr. Jung.</b>

156
00:10:40,555 --> 00:10:42,950
<b>What about the proof? Did you find it?</b>

157
00:10:43,255 --> 00:10:44,580
<b>I couldn't.</b>

158

<b>[ But ]</b>

159

[ - I met with Mr. Lim. ]</b>

161
00:10:53,095 --> 00:10:55,660
<b>He told me that
I should take care of it now.</b>

162

<b>If I don't go now,</b>

<b>[ it's likely that he will suspect me. ]</b>

164
00:11:03,105 --> 00:11:04,500
<b>Okay. I see.</b>

165
00:11:05,475 --> 00:11:06,970
<b>I'll see you at the police station.</b>

<b>Don't trust Mr. Jung too much.</b>

<b>- What? Byeol-na is gone again?
- Yes.</b>

169

<b>Byeol-na is with my dad.</b>

170
00:11:23,325 --> 00:11:24,324
<b>- What?
- What?</b>

171
00:11:24,325 --> 00:11:26,490
<b>I called Seung-mo just in case

172
00:11:27,195 --> 00:11:28,730
<b>He's with her now.</b>

173
00:11:28,835 --> 00:11:30,834
<b>- My gosh.
- Don't worry too much.</b>

174
00:11:30,835 --> 00:11:33,164
<b>He must have missed her a lot.</b>

175
00:11:33,165 --> 00:11:34,370
<b>Right.</b>

176

<b>Byeol-na made us great outfits.</b>

183

<b>Shouldn't we do something

<b>How about putting on a fashion show?</b>

187

<b>A fashion show?</b>

188
00:12:01,535 --> 00:12:04,360
<b>She made the outfits for us.
We ought to put on a show for her.</b>

<b>- That sounds nice. I like this idea.
- Yes.</b>

193
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:17,680
<b>By the way,
what do we know about fashion shows?</b>

194
00:12:21,085 --> 00:12:24,580
<b>How about we ask
the broadcasting company to help us?</b>

195
00:12:24,755 --> 00:12:25,880
<b>What?</b>

196
00:12:25,955 --> 00:12:27,080

<b>Hold on.</b>

200
00:12:35,295 --> 00:12:37,160

<b>I want to put up a big screen

00:12:48,045 --> 00:12:49,770
<b>I shouldn't have</b>

<b>No.</b>

207

<b>If you hadn't told me,</b>

208

<b>I would have resented you more.</b>

209

<b>why do you want to see Lim Hyun-a?</b>

211

<b>I was trying to take

<b>that she will get all the punishment

219
00:14:12,495 --> 00:14:14,190
<b>[ She doesn't need to be admitted. ]</b>

220
00:14:14,235 --> 00:14:16,030

228

<b>[ What do you say? ]</b>

312
00:22:41,335 --> 00:22:43,804
<b>It will be a collaboration

313
00:22:43,805 --> 00:22:45,304
<b>here at Seoha village.</b>

314
00:22:45,305 --> 00:22:47,840
<b>"A fashion show and food"?
That sounds good.</b>

315
00:22:48,215 --> 00:22:50,670
<b>- But who will hold the fashion show?
- Don't worry.</b>

316
00:22:51,415 --> 00:22:54,814
<b>We have a world-famous designer
in our village.</b>

<b>Yes.</b>

318
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,680

<b>[ Lim Hyun-a to Seoha Village? ]</b>

320
00:23:03,895 --> 00:23:06,220
<b>I was also doubtful at first,</b>

321
00:23:06,425 --> 00:23:08,560
<b>but this could be our best weapon</b>

322
00:23:08,635 --> 00:23:10,590
<b>to pressure Lim Chul-yong.</b>

323

<b>And the girl wants it so much.</b>

324
00:23:15,275 --> 00:23:16,670
<b>[ That's true, ]</b>

325
00:23:17,035 --> 00:23:19,840

would do if he finds out.</b>

326
00:23:20,145 --> 00:23:21,470
<b>Isn't it too dangerous?</b>

327
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:24,140
<b>I think we should aim for that, exactly.</b>

328
00:23:24,615 --> 00:23:26,314
<b>[ What? But... ]</b>

329
00:23:26,315 --> 00:23:29,880
<b>We don't have any clear evidence

<b>Do you really think
we should be acting like this?</b>

331

<b>If we don't have evidence,</b>

332

<b>My dad often sits out here.</b>

<b>That's why I tried to sit here sometimes</b>

<b>just like my dad.</b>

445
00:30:23,945 --> 00:30:26,440
<b>Maybe it's because I'm too young,</b>

446

467
00:32:06,945 --> 00:32:08,640
<b>What do you mean?</b>

468
00:32:10,115 --> 00:32:11,640
<b>It feels warm</b>

469
00:32:12,545 --> 00:32:13,880
<b>and cozy.</b>

470
00:32:15,455 --> 00:32:16,880
<b>Free</b>

471
00:32:19,155 --> 00:32:20,720
<b>and cute too.</b>

472
00:32:23,125 --> 00:32:25,490
<b>Yes, you're right.</b>

473
00:32:26,125 --> 00:32:27,990
<b>Looking at Seol-a's dress,</b>

474
00:32:29,235 --> 00:32:31,160
<b>it seems like Bella's style</b>

475
00:32:32,465 --> 00:32:34,400
<b>has changed that way too.</b>

476
00:32:35,635 --> 00:32:37,770
<b>How should I say this...</b>

477
00:32:39,175 --> 00:32:41,440
<b>She seems carefree,</b>

478
00:32:41,945 --> 00:32:43,610
<b>and as if she's saying,</b>

479
00:32:44,015 --> 00:32:47,680
<b>"Yes, this is me."</b>

480
00:32:49,085 --> 00:32:50,320
<b>Do you think</b>

481
00:32:51,825 --> 00:32:53,790
<b>I could be like that too?</b>

482
00:32:57,195 --> 00:32:59,930
<b>Of course. You can do it.</b>

483
00:33:04,335 --> 00:33:08,330
<b>Watching the villagers earlier,</b>

484
00:33:10,075 --> 00:33:11,540
<b>I felt so envious.</b>

485
00:33:14,245 --> 00:33:15,640
<b>Of the village</b>

486
00:33:17,785 --> 00:33:19,340
<b>and this house.</b>

487
00:33:21,155 --> 00:33:22,280
<b>But...</b>

488
00:33:22,815 --> 00:33:24,950
<b>Don't you think it's so ironic?</b>

489
00:33:26,355 --> 00:33:29,320
<b>She ended up here because of you.</b>

490
00:33:35,795 --> 00:33:38,760
<b>I'm saying this to ease your guilt.</b>

491
00:33:42,775 --> 00:33:43,940
<b>Thank you</b>

492
00:33:44,705 --> 00:33:47,670
<b>for bringing me here too.</b>

493
00:33:49,475 --> 00:33:52,280
<b>Thank you for coming with us.</b>

494
00:35:11,795 --> 00:35:13,259
<b>It suits you well.</b>

495
00:35:13,365 --> 00:35:14,560
<b>Thank you.</b>

496
00:35:17,805 --> 00:35:19,160
<b>Why aren't you asleep?</b>

497
00:35:19,435 --> 00:35:21,800
<b>How can I sleep
when you're out here like this?</b>

498
00:35:27,515 --> 00:35:28,910
<b>Thank you</b>

499
00:35:29,945 --> 00:35:31,680
<b>for letting me be</b>

500
00:35:33,145 --> 00:35:34,810
<b>with Madam Jang and everything.</b>

501
00:35:34,985 --> 00:35:36,250
<b>No need to thank me.</b>

502
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:38,720
<b>She is like a mother to you.</b>

503
00:35:40,855 --> 00:35:42,020
<b>You're right.</b>

504
00:35:43,365 --> 00:35:44,720
<b>She has lived with me</b>

505
00:35:45,825 --> 00:35:47,830
<b>longer than my own mother had.</b>

506
00:35:52,535 --> 00:35:53,770
<b>It must be tough for you.</b>

507
00:35:57,275 --> 00:35:59,440
<b>You're the one who's going through a lot.</b>

508
00:36:00,445 --> 00:36:02,440
<b>It has been over 20 years for me,</b>

509
00:36:03,075 --> 00:36:04,580
<b>but that's not the case for you.</b>

510
00:36:08,555 --> 00:36:09,950
<b>I just can't believe</b>

511
00:36:11,325 --> 00:36:12,520
<b>any of this.</b>

512
00:36:15,925 --> 00:36:17,490
<b>I can't accept it, either.</b>

513
00:36:23,805 --> 00:36:25,200
<b>Nothing will happen, right?</b>

514
00:36:56,235 --> 00:37:01,634
<b>One, two, one, two.</b>

515
00:37:01,635 --> 00:37:02,830
<b>Here.</b>

516
00:37:05,475 --> 00:37:06,600
<b>It's good!</b>

517
00:37:08,915 --> 00:37:10,844
<b>- We are
- Closed today</b>

518
00:37:10,845 --> 00:37:12,514
<b>- and tomorrow
- due to the preparation</b>

519
00:37:12,515 --> 00:37:14,610
<b>- for
- the fashion show!</b>

520
00:37:16,515 --> 00:37:17,680
<b>Good.</b>

521
00:37:18,585 --> 00:37:19,750
<b>What are you doing?</b>

522
00:37:21,725 --> 00:37:24,290
<b>That's Byeol-na's sweater,</b>

523
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:27,560
<b>but it also looks good on you.</b>

524
00:37:28,095 --> 00:37:29,230
<b>Really?</b>

525
00:37:29,995 --> 00:37:32,364
<b>Would you like to show me around the town?</b>

526
00:37:32,365 --> 00:37:33,530
<b>Sure!</b>

527
00:37:35,475 --> 00:37:37,770
<b>- I'll go with you.
- Come along.</b>

528
00:37:53,895 --> 00:37:57,590
<b>This is where you can see
the entire Seoha Village.</b>

529
00:37:57,965 --> 00:37:59,160
<b>Beautiful, isn't it?</b>

530
00:38:02,235 --> 00:38:03,500
<b>It's stunning.</b>

531
00:38:11,775 --> 00:38:13,510
<b>[ I have something to tell you. ]</b>

532
00:38:13,745 --> 00:38:14,940
<b>What is it?</b>

533
00:38:16,345 --> 00:38:19,410
<b>The reason I went to Seoul was</b>

534
00:38:22,955 --> 00:38:24,920
<b>that I found out</b>

535
00:38:26,085 --> 00:38:29,690
<b>that Lim Chul-yong was behind the fire
at Pungcheonok.</b>

536
00:38:29,825 --> 00:38:32,790
<b>- What?
- No way.</b>

537
00:38:32,865 --> 00:38:34,990
<b>Not only so, but Yu-jin's mother,
Ms. Yoo Hyo-myoung,</b>

538
00:38:36,435 --> 00:38:38,900
<b>also did not pass away in a car accident</b>

539
00:38:39,835 --> 00:38:41,970
<b>but was killed under the orders
of Lim Chul-yong.</b>

540
00:38:42,075 --> 00:38:45,000
<b>What do you mean? What happened to her?</b>

541
00:38:45,245 --> 00:38:47,770
<b>Lim Chul-yong did?</b>

542
00:38:48,215 --> 00:38:52,010
<b>I can't ask you for help,
knowing how dangerous it is.</b>

543
00:38:52,045 --> 00:38:53,550
<b>No, let us know if you need help.</b>

544
00:38:53,555 --> 00:38:55,850
<b>Yes, indeed.</b>

545
00:38:56,415 --> 00:38:58,880
<b>I expect him to make a move
today or tomorrow.</b>

546
00:38:59,125 --> 00:39:01,220
<b>So don't do anything on your own.</b>

547
00:39:01,595 --> 00:39:06,120
<b>In particular, we'll need to watch out
for Seol-a and Hyun-a.</b>

548
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:08,230
<b>Okay.</b>

549
00:39:17,945 --> 00:39:19,100
<b>Yes, Mr. Jung.</b>

550
00:39:20,475 --> 00:39:21,810
<b>You're on your way here?</b>

551
00:39:22,075 --> 00:39:23,640
<b>I just started driving now.</b>

552
00:39:24,245 --> 00:39:25,910
<b>Did you get any proof?</b>

553
00:39:26,415 --> 00:39:27,650
<b>I have.</b>

554
00:39:28,415 --> 00:39:29,880
<b>[ I'll show you when I get there. ]</b>

555
00:39:30,685 --> 00:39:31,820
<b>Okay.</b>

556
00:39:41,935 --> 00:39:44,130
<b>[ - Did the investigation go well? ]
- Yes, sir.</b>

557
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:46,300
<b>Thanks to you,</b>

558
00:39:47,335 --> 00:39:49,500
<b>I had a comfortable time here.</b>

559
00:39:49,705 --> 00:39:52,044
<b>[ All right. Good job. ]</b>

560
00:39:52,045 --> 00:39:53,170
<b>Yes, sir.</b>

561
00:39:54,515 --> 00:39:57,110
<b>- Sir,
[ - Yes? ]</b>

562
00:39:58,845 --> 00:40:00,040
<b>I have something to say.</b>

563
00:40:04,125 --> 00:40:05,980
<b>Moon Seung-mo approached me.</b>

564
00:40:06,685 --> 00:40:07,790
<b>[ What? ]</b>

565
00:40:08,455 --> 00:40:10,260
<b>Moon Seung-mo found me</b>

566
00:40:11,165 --> 00:40:13,990
<b>and threatened me to tell him everything
regarding the Pungcheonok incident.</b>

567
00:40:14,795 --> 00:40:16,430
<b>He thinks</b>

568
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:19,160
<b>I am on his side.</b>

569
00:40:31,085 --> 00:40:34,550
<b>Look! Spring is here!</b>

570
00:40:35,055 --> 00:40:38,320
<b>You look beautiful with the flower
in your hair!</b>

571
00:40:38,325 --> 00:40:40,624
<b>Seol-a, can you put some in my hair, too?</b>

572
00:40:40,625 --> 00:40:41,894
<b>Look at that.</b>

573
00:40:41,895 --> 00:40:44,290
<b>It's a flower carrying flowers!</b>

574
00:40:44,425 --> 00:40:46,494
<b>What kind of flower is this?</b>

575
00:40:46,495 --> 00:40:49,134
<b>- Right, what kind is it?
- It's camomile.</b>

576
00:40:49,135 --> 00:40:50,600
<b>Camomile.</b>

577
00:40:58,175 --> 00:40:59,874
<b>Mr. Jung is on his way,</b>

578
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:02,370
<b>so let's take Hyun-a to Seoha Teahouse.</b>

579
00:41:03,045 --> 00:41:05,740
<b>I can't trust him fully right now.</b>

580
00:41:07,155 --> 00:41:08,350
<b>Let's do that.</b>

581
00:41:09,655 --> 00:41:10,780
<b>Sure.</b>

582
00:41:15,725 --> 00:41:16,820
<b>Hyo-sook,</b>

583
00:41:17,695 --> 00:41:19,720
<b>- let's open up the teahouse.
- Sorry?</b>

584
00:41:20,125 --> 00:41:21,194
<b>Yes.</b>

585
00:41:21,195 --> 00:41:25,430
<b>We've got two famous designers here,</b>

586
00:41:25,605 --> 00:41:29,274
<b>so why don't we do a rehearsal
at the teahouse?</b>

587
00:41:29,275 --> 00:41:32,004
<b>That's a great idea!</b>

588
00:41:32,005 --> 00:41:34,770
<b>- Can I tag along?
- Of course.</b>

589
00:41:34,775 --> 00:41:36,844
<b>- You have to rehearse, too.
[ - You're right. ]</b>

590
00:41:36,845 --> 00:41:39,340
<b>[ Let's get going, then. ]</b>

591
00:41:39,345 --> 00:41:40,950
<b>[ Let's go! ]</b>

592
00:41:41,015 --> 00:41:43,150
<b>- Be careful.
- Will do.</b>

593
00:41:55,435 --> 00:41:56,890
<b>[ My daughter, Hyo-sook, ]</b>

<b>no, Da-mi, is from a modelling school.</b>

595
00:42:02,375 --> 00:42:06,140
<b>You have no idea how much money
I invested in her.</b>

596

<b>Everyone, follow me.</b>

597
00:42:09,445 --> 00:42:10,610
<b>Sure.</b>

598
00:42:14,115 --> 00:42:16,654
<b>[ Make your gaze powerful! ]</b>

599
00:42:16,655 --> 00:42:18,484
<b>- Powerful!
- As if you're a predator.</b>

600
00:42:18,485 --> 00:42:20,024
<b>- Powerful.
- All right.</b>

601
00:42:20,025 --> 00:42:21,724
<b>Everyone, follow me now.</b>

602
00:42:21,725 --> 00:42:22,950
<b>Okay!</b>

603
00:42:23,255 --> 00:42:25,960
<b>- Lift your leg. Yes.
- Strong gaze!</b>

604

<b>[ Shake your body! Scatter it. ]</b>

605
00:42:29,065 --> 00:42:31,264
<b>Powerful gaze. You're doing so well!</b>

606
00:42:31,265 --> 00:42:32,800
<b>- How am I doing?
- Awesome.</b>

607
00:42:33,535 --> 00:42:35,270
<b>- You're so good.
- I am, aren't I?</b>

608
00:42:35,635 --> 00:42:37,170
<b>Powerful, right?</b>

609
00:42:37,875 --> 00:42:40,140
<b>What should we do?</b>

610
00:42:40,245 --> 00:42:42,170
<b>We can't let this be.</b>

611
00:42:42,775 --> 00:42:44,114
<b>I have to do my job.</b>

612

<b>Nice restaurant.</b>

617

<b>Where is Hyun-a?</b>

618
00:43:08,575 --> 00:43:11,444

<b>She isn't here right now.</b>

621
