<b>What happened?</b>

4
00:01:24,757 --> 00:01:25,883
<b>He blew himself up.</b>

5
00:01:28,928 --> 00:01:31,806
<b>-Shall we move him to the HQ?
-No, they might be tracking him.</b>

6
00:01:33,057 --> 00:01:34,767
<b>-Let's take him to K Hospital.
-Okay.</b>

7
00:01:37,562 --> 00:01:38,730
<b>Where's Dr. Oh's number?</b>

8
00:01:52,702 --> 00:01:55,663
<b>It's a transcranial
direct-current stimulation device.</b>

9
00:01:55,747 --> 00:01:58,082
<b>-What is that?
-The method is called "brain doping."</b>

10
00:01:59,042 --> 00:02:01,002
<b>An electric current
is sent through the brain</b>

11
00:02:01,085 --> 00:02:02,837
<b>to abnormally stimulate
the bodily functions.</b>

12
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,213
<b>How dangerous is it?</b>

13
00:02:04,297 --> 00:02:06,382
<b>Planting this inside someone's brain
is crazy enough.</b>

14
00:02:06,466 --> 00:02:08,676
<b>A high-voltage current
was sent through this.</b>

15
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:12,555
<b>It's enough to blow up most people's
brains, except for rare cases.</b>

16
00:02:14,515 --> 00:02:16,684
<b>-Hello.
-Hey, Bradley.</b>

17
00:02:17,685 --> 00:02:18,895
<b>-Take a look at this.
-Okay.</b>

18
00:02:31,407 --> 00:02:34,035
<b>It can be turned on and off remotely.</b>

19
00:02:34,118 --> 00:02:37,580
<b>There's a pressure sensor, which means
he was able to control the voltage.</b>

20
00:02:38,498 --> 00:02:41,626
<b>By pressing this spot right here
like this.</b>

21
00:02:44,045 --> 00:02:47,423
<b>People have disappeared,
and so have the evidence.</b>

22
00:02:47,882 --> 00:02:49,967
<b>Maybe the reason for kidnapping
is something worse</b>

23
00:02:50,051 --> 00:02:52,011
<b>than destroying everything.</b>

24
00:02:52,428 --> 00:02:55,807
<b>But don't worry too much.
It's clumsily made.</b>

25
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:56,724
<b>It is?</b>

26
00:02:57,392 --> 00:02:59,018
<b>We're looking at a failure right here.</b>

27
00:02:59,143 --> 00:03:01,562
<b>He would've died anyway
even if his brain hadn't blown up.</b>

28
00:03:01,646 --> 00:03:03,022
<b>What do you mean?</b>

29
00:03:03,106 --> 00:03:06,359
<b>The planting procedure itself must've
damaged his central nervous system.</b>

30
00:03:06,442 --> 00:03:09,362
<b>I'm sure he experienced severe pain
and even paralysis.</b>

31
00:03:09,445 --> 00:03:11,989
<b>-So this is a failed attempt?
-The technology was ruled out</b>

32
00:03:12,073 --> 00:03:15,535
<b>during Rugal's early days

<b>You made a wise decision, Director Gu.</b>

38

<b>We can be pretty rough,</b>

39
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,874
<b>but we care.</b>

40

<b>Once we accept someone into the family,

<b>I trust that you'll keep your promise.</b>

<b>I don't have time for this.
Just tell me what you need.</b>

43
00:04:18,598 --> 00:04:20,933
<b>It used to be supported
by the government. It'll cost a lot--</b>

44
00:04:21,017 --> 00:04:23,936
<b>I have too much money,
so don't worry. What else?</b>

45
00:04:25,104 --> 00:04:28,941
<b>I need healthy experimental bodies.
A lot of them.</b>

46
00:04:30,651 --> 00:04:32,320
<b>That will be a piece of cake for me.</b>

47

<b>I'll get you men and women

<b>ARGOS' MAIN BOSSES</b>

<b>Unless they're idiots,</b>

52
00:04:48,711 --> 00:04:51,339

<b>Argos committing crimes

<b>-When can we expect further instructions?
-Not sure.</b>

65

<b>Rugal is a national agency

66

<b>We'll wait to find out who's responsible

<b>An internal feud will break out

<b>Let's just watch

72

<b>Is this because of me?</b>

73
00:06:05,371 --> 00:06:07,915
<b>Are we reducing our action radius

<b>Gi-beom, you'll just support the others

<b>Do you not have a brain or what?</b>

88
00:07:06,474 --> 00:07:07,850
<b>Think, will you?</b>

89
00:07:07,933 --> 00:07:10,102
<b>Then what about nachos and hot dogs?</b>

90
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:13,147
<b>You should go with him.</b>

91
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:14,607
<b>Yes, I will.</b>

92
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:17,985
<b>What? Are you avoiding me?</b>

93
00:07:18,486 --> 00:07:19,487
<b>Yes.</b>

<b>Okay.</b>

00:38:36,775 --> 00:38:37,734
<b>Thank you.</b>

459
00:38:39,486 --> 00:38:40,779
<b>Gi-joon...</b>

460
00:38:41,905 --> 00:38:43,156
<b>Gi-joon...</b>

461
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:44,658
<b>My gosh.</b>

462
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,161
<b>Goodness me.</b>

463
00:39:00,757 --> 00:39:01,883
<b>Let's go.</b>

464
00:39:20,444 --> 00:39:22,696
<b><i>No one goes that far just to retaliate.</i></b>

465
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:27,075
<b>Could there really be
another reason for this?</b>

466
00:39:27,868 --> 00:39:31,204
<b>Tae-woong, do you remember anything
from your past that could help...</b>

467
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,502
<b>What I mean is...</b>

468
00:39:37,711 --> 00:39:40,130
<b>Does anything come to mind?</b>

469
00:39:41,798 --> 00:39:42,883
<b>I don't know.</b>

470
00:39:43,842 --> 00:39:44,718
<b>Not really.</b>

471
00:39:50,932 --> 00:39:54,061
<b>I don't care what the reason is
since it won't make a difference.</b>

472
00:39:54,853 --> 00:39:57,230
<b>There will be no mercy.</b>

473
00:39:58,523 --> 00:39:59,524
<b>None.</b>

474
00:41:12,264 --> 00:41:13,265
<b>Shit.</b>

475
00:41:16,685 --> 00:41:18,061
<b>I won't kill you</b>

476
00:41:18,979 --> 00:41:20,397
<b>since there's no replacement.</b>

477
00:41:22,274 --> 00:41:24,401
<b>It's not like we didn't try.</b>

478
00:41:24,484 --> 00:41:25,444
<b>This is just impossible.</b>

479
00:41:25,527 --> 00:41:27,487
<b>That's the excuse you give me</b>

480
00:41:28,405 --> 00:41:30,407
<b>after killing countless people?</b>

481
00:41:31,908 --> 00:41:33,535
<b>Kim Dae-sik, who was barely activated,</b>

482
00:41:34,202 --> 00:41:36,079
<b>was also a failure.</b>

483
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,791
<b>He was only useful
as a self-detonating bomb.</b>

484
00:41:39,875 --> 00:41:41,251
<b>That was before I came.</b>

485
00:41:41,334 --> 00:41:42,836
<b>However, the results</b>

486
00:41:43,545 --> 00:41:45,922
<b>came out after you came.</b>

487
00:41:46,006 --> 00:41:47,716
<b>No human</b>

488
00:41:48,008 --> 00:41:50,761
<b>can withstand this much reconstruction.</b>

489
00:41:53,555 --> 00:41:55,348
<b>And I'm a man who never gives up.</b>

490
00:41:56,141 --> 00:41:59,019
<b>If you don't want me
to stick these in you instead,</b>

491
00:41:59,102 --> 00:42:00,687
<b>you'll make this work.</b>

492
00:42:03,398 --> 00:42:05,859
<b>Just keep in mind that this is something</b>

493
00:42:06,943 --> 00:42:07,819
<b>I seriously want.</b>

494
00:42:09,613 --> 00:42:11,615
<b>I truly mean that.</b>

495
00:42:21,416 --> 00:42:23,376
<b>Anyway, I don't want you skipping meals.</b>

496
00:42:28,632 --> 00:42:29,591
<b>Carry on then.</b>

497
00:42:44,898 --> 00:42:46,483
<b>The police station</b>

498
00:42:47,943 --> 00:42:49,694
<b>and the hospital?</b>

499
00:42:50,862 --> 00:42:53,657
<b>Are you proud of yourselves?</b>

500
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:55,742
<b>Are you, you fools?</b>

501
00:42:55,826 --> 00:42:59,955
<b>Find out who did this, right now!</b>

502
00:43:17,389 --> 00:43:18,765
<b>Clear the body</b>

503
00:43:19,766 --> 00:43:20,934
<b>and enjoy your meal.</b>

504
00:43:44,875 --> 00:43:46,960
<b>After obtaining what they were after,</b>

505
00:43:47,752 --> 00:43:49,796
<b>they erased traces of any evidence.</b>

506
00:43:52,215 --> 00:43:54,217
<b>They are imitating me.</b>

507
00:44:00,765 --> 00:44:02,017
<b>Hurry on in.</b>

508
00:44:06,813 --> 00:44:08,315
<b>Gwang-cheol.</b>

509
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:13,737
<b>Tae-woong!</b>

510
00:44:16,072 --> 00:44:19,451
<b>You said you had other errands to run
when I asked you to join me.</b>

511
00:44:19,534 --> 00:44:21,077
<b>Was that a lie?</b>

512
00:44:23,038 --> 00:44:24,748
<b>Before we joined Rugal,</b>

513
00:44:25,457 --> 00:44:28,710
<b>we weren't in a state to maintain</b>

514
00:44:28,793 --> 00:44:30,545
<b>any personal relationships.</b>

515
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:32,923
<b>So, of course, we have nowhere to go</b>

516
00:44:33,006 --> 00:44:34,633
<b>and no one to see.</b>

517
00:44:36,009 --> 00:44:37,093
<b>It's obvious.</b>

518
00:44:37,177 --> 00:44:39,721
<b>There's no need to explain yourself.</b>

519
00:44:41,014 --> 00:44:41,890
<b>Right.</b>

520
00:44:55,028 --> 00:44:56,821
<b>How did you leave the organization though?</b>

521
00:44:56,905 --> 00:44:58,406
<b>It probably wasn't easy.</b>

522
00:45:01,743 --> 00:45:03,536
<b>Those in the organization</b>

523
00:45:05,413 --> 00:45:06,498
<b>killed my sister.</b>

524
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:11,920
<b>My freedom was at the expense of her life.</b>

525
00:45:13,838 --> 00:45:15,048
<b>It's why</b>

526
00:45:16,216 --> 00:45:17,676
<b>I must be live well.</b>

527
00:45:18,051 --> 00:45:19,094
<b>Like the police.</b>

528
00:45:20,971 --> 00:45:21,972
<b>At least</b>

529
00:45:23,682 --> 00:45:24,891
<b>somewhere near their level.</b>

530
00:45:25,558 --> 00:45:26,851
<b>Why the police</b>

531
00:45:27,352 --> 00:45:28,478
<b>of all people though?</b>

532
00:45:28,561 --> 00:45:30,563
<b>Because being like those
who are my polar opposite</b>

533
00:45:31,147 --> 00:45:34,567
<b>is the only way to protect myself.</b>

534
00:45:36,069 --> 00:45:36,945
<b>What about you?</b>

535
00:45:39,155 --> 00:45:40,115
<b>Me?</b>

536
00:45:40,824 --> 00:45:43,743
<b>A successful businessman
who was fucked over</b>

537
00:45:43,994 --> 00:45:46,079
<b>by a blindly righteous tattletale.</b>

538
00:45:46,663 --> 00:45:50,291
<b>That's odd since Mi-na told me
a completely different story.</b>

539
00:45:55,797 --> 00:45:57,173
<b>Mi-na, you...</b>

540
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:22,073
<b>You see, I'm a big collector.</b>

541
00:46:22,574 --> 00:46:24,034
<b>I begged Chief Choi to give it to me.</b>

542
00:46:24,909 --> 00:46:27,412
<b>Ta-da.</b>

543
00:46:28,204 --> 00:46:29,497
<b>I got it.</b>

544
00:46:29,831 --> 00:46:30,790
<b>Can you activate it?</b>

545
00:46:30,874 --> 00:46:32,125
<b>You want me to take it out?</b>

546
00:46:32,208 --> 00:46:34,127
<b>What is it? You can't?</b>

547
00:46:34,294 --> 00:46:36,713
<b>It might corrode when exposed to oxygen.</b>

548
00:46:38,089 --> 00:46:39,382
<b>You're a quack, aren't you?</b>

549
00:46:39,674 --> 00:46:41,801
<b>Bring it on. This way.</b>

550
00:46:41,885 --> 00:46:42,969
<b>All right, you quack.</b>

551
00:46:43,053 --> 00:46:44,054
<b>My gosh.</b>

552
00:47:01,029 --> 00:47:04,574
<b>-We should inform Chief Choi.
-No.</b>

553
00:47:04,657 --> 00:47:07,452
<b>-What?
-Don't you know anything about covert ops?</b>

554
00:47:08,787 --> 00:47:10,121
<b>But still,</b>

555
00:47:10,205 --> 00:47:12,791
<b>this is nothing trivial.</b>

556
00:47:22,175 --> 00:47:23,676
<b>That can't be.</b>

557
00:47:24,552 --> 00:47:25,678
<b>Kang Gi-beom.</b>

558
00:47:26,596 --> 00:47:29,641
<b>I can't believe he's the one
who did this to me.</b>

559
00:47:30,475 --> 00:47:32,644
<b>I don't need to hear your opinion.</b>

560
00:47:33,603 --> 00:47:35,438
<b>You should start going outside.</b>

561
00:47:36,022 --> 00:47:37,774
<b>Why is that?</b>

562
00:47:38,358 --> 00:47:40,068
<b>It's his dream to kill you.</b>

563
00:47:43,530 --> 00:47:44,531
<b>What's wrong?</b>

564
00:47:45,782 --> 00:47:49,285
<b>-Do you not want to?
-I'm not fully recovered just yet.</b>

565
00:47:50,078 --> 00:47:52,497
<b>What if I run into him?</b>

566
00:47:56,251 --> 00:47:57,585
<b>If you don't want to,</b>

567
00:47:58,336 --> 00:47:59,671
<b>then there's nothing I can do.</b>

568
00:48:00,171 --> 00:48:02,340
<b>-Just die now.
-I'll do it!</b>

569
00:48:02,423 --> 00:48:04,884
<b>I'll do anything you ask me to do!</b>

570
00:48:21,192 --> 00:48:22,068
<b>I guess</b>

571
00:48:23,903 --> 00:48:25,405
<b>you'll stay alive for a while.</b>

572
00:48:42,255 --> 00:48:45,508
<b>Send me this signal
and keep tracking it, got it?</b>

573
00:48:45,925 --> 00:48:46,926
<b>What?</b>

574
00:48:48,094 --> 00:48:49,512
<b>Wait. Where are you...</b>

575
00:48:49,596 --> 00:48:50,680
<b>Where...</b>

576
00:49:55,956 --> 00:49:58,124
<b>Hey, Kim Dae-sik's mastermind.</b>

577
00:50:02,045 --> 00:50:03,880
<b>-Min Dal-ho?
-Hey, Gi-beom.</b>

578
00:50:03,964 --> 00:50:05,215
<b>Why are you here?</b>

579
00:50:06,716 --> 00:50:07,926
<b>Weren't you looking for me?</b>

580
00:50:09,511 --> 00:50:11,638
<b>We have a lot of things to chat about.</b>

581
00:50:12,138 --> 00:50:14,683
<b>We just can't die, can we?</b>

582
00:50:19,938 --> 00:50:22,274
<b>What do you think would happen
if I were to twist your neck?</b>

583
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:24,442
<b>Spare me.</b>

584
00:50:27,237 --> 00:50:28,238
<b>No.</b>

585
00:50:29,406 --> 00:50:31,157
<b>I'll kill you one day.</b>

586
00:50:31,241 --> 00:50:32,325
<b>How frightening.</b>

587
00:50:33,034 --> 00:50:33,952
<b>Where is he?</b>

588
00:50:34,035 --> 00:50:36,121
<b>Why the hell do you ask?</b>

589
00:51:10,613 --> 00:51:11,823
<b>Damn it!</b>

590
00:51:12,115 --> 00:51:14,451
<b>What's going on? This scared me.</b>

591
00:51:14,534 --> 00:51:16,161
<b>What is that?</b>

592
00:51:17,287 --> 00:51:20,206
<b>Damn it.</b>

593
00:51:20,290 --> 00:51:22,083
<b>He never told me that would happen.</b>

594
00:51:22,167 --> 00:51:23,001
<b>Fuck.</b>

595
00:51:37,182 --> 00:51:39,225
<b>Was the voltage too high?</b>

596
00:51:43,730 --> 00:51:44,564
<b>Hello.</b>

597
00:51:48,610 --> 00:51:49,444
<b>What's wrong?</b>

598
00:51:50,111 --> 00:51:52,072
<b>It looks like you were caught
fooling around.</b>

599
00:51:52,655 --> 00:51:56,242
<b>Me? Don't be ridiculous.</b>

600
00:51:58,703 --> 00:51:59,704
<b>Wait.</b>

601
00:52:01,373 --> 00:52:02,957
<b>Hold on a minute.</b>

602
00:52:04,918 --> 00:52:05,919
<b>Wait!</b>

603
00:52:07,003 --> 00:52:09,339
<b>I see. You weren't fooling around.</b>

604
00:52:09,422 --> 00:52:11,174
<b>You were doing something dangerous.</b>

605
00:52:11,883 --> 00:52:13,009
<b>What is it?</b>

606
00:52:15,804 --> 00:52:17,013
<b>Tell him yourself.</b>

607
00:52:20,141 --> 00:52:21,017
<b>Well...</b>

608
00:52:21,101 --> 00:52:22,018
<b>So...</b>

609
00:52:24,729 --> 00:52:28,817
<b>I resuscitated Kim Dae-sik's equipment.</b>

610
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:30,110
<b>And then,</b>

611
00:52:30,819 --> 00:52:33,405
<b>it suddenly made this noise--</b>

612
00:52:33,488 --> 00:52:34,906
<b>Cut to the chase.</b>

613
00:52:35,365 --> 00:52:38,368
<b>Yes, sir. He has it.</b>

614
00:52:40,328 --> 00:52:41,538
<b>Chief.</b>

615
00:52:42,247 --> 00:52:43,665
<b>I can't find Gi-beom.</b>

616
00:52:46,459 --> 00:52:47,961
<b>Turn on the streaming device.</b>

617
00:52:48,044 --> 00:52:49,170
<b>Yes, sir.</b>

618
00:53:16,406 --> 00:53:17,407
<b>-Goodness!
-Gosh!</b>

619
00:53:44,976 --> 00:53:46,227
<b>Hwang Deuk-gu!</b>

620
00:53:52,734 --> 00:53:54,194
<b>You've risen from the dead,</b>

621
00:53:55,361 --> 00:53:56,905
<b>Kang Gi-beom.</b>

622
00:54:08,625 --> 00:54:10,043
<b>Is there no audio?</b>

623
00:54:10,168 --> 00:54:12,462
<b>No. We can only see what he's seeing.</b>

624
00:54:13,129 --> 00:54:14,797
<b>He's probably wearing an earpiece.</b>

625
00:54:15,507 --> 00:54:17,133
<b>-Turn it on.
-Yes, sir.</b>

626

627
00:54:23,848 --> 00:54:25,225
<b>How are you alive again?</b>

628
00:54:25,308 --> 00:54:27,810
<b>Why did you send Kim Dae-sik?
Why did you kill him?</b>

629
00:54:27,894 --> 00:54:29,229
<b>How did you get your new eyes?</b>

630
00:54:29,312 --> 00:54:31,856
<b>-Did you kill Assemblyman Park?
-Whom are you working with?</b>

631
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:33,816
<b>-Is Director Gu still alive?
-Answer me.</b>

632
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:35,235
<b>Who are you?</b>

633
00:54:35,318 --> 00:54:37,362
<b>Who are you?</b>

634
00:54:43,493 --> 00:54:44,827
<b><i>Rats like Officer Kim here?</i></b>

635
00:54:45,828 --> 00:54:47,956
<b><i>He sure does love his kids.</i></b>

636
00:54:48,039 --> 00:54:50,583
<b>But he doesn't seem to care about
other people's kids.</b>

637
00:54:56,923 --> 00:54:59,592
<b>Gi-beom, it's him.</b>

638
00:54:59,676 --> 00:55:01,761
<b><i>Sergeant Mun, Officer Kim,</i></b>

639
00:55:02,095 --> 00:55:06,057
<b><i>and all the witnesses we were protecting
were killed in his hands.</i></b>

640
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:07,850
<b><i>I remember that evil voice.</i></b>

641
00:55:08,476 --> 00:55:09,352
<b><i>It's him.</i></b>

642
00:55:11,187 --> 00:55:13,189
<b>Was it you, Deuk-gu?</b>

643
00:55:15,275 --> 00:55:17,235
<b>Did you really want to meet me?</b>

644
00:55:17,318 --> 00:55:20,363
<b>Yes, because you're the reason
that everything happened.</b>

645
00:55:20,446 --> 00:55:24,242
<b>You don't have to flatter me like that.</b>

646
00:55:35,962 --> 00:55:38,798
<b><i>Gi-beom, we want him alive!</i></b>

647

<b>Gi-beom!</b>

00:55:51,603 --> 00:55:52,770
<b>Gi-beom!</b>

650
00:55:57,233 --> 00:56:00,194
<b>Chief, please send us in.</b>

651
00:56:00,528 --> 00:56:01,779
<b>I'll catch him myself.</b>

652
00:56:06,326 --> 00:56:08,953
<b>Rugal. All of you will go.</b>

653
00:56:09,621 --> 00:56:10,788
<b>-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.</b>

654
00:56:11,414 --> 00:56:13,541
<b>Find Gi-beom first and stop him.</b>

655
00:56:13,625 --> 00:56:14,542
<b>Sir.</b>

656
00:56:15,126 --> 00:56:17,211
<b>Hwang Deuk-gu is our target, not Gi-beom.</b>

657
00:56:17,295 --> 00:56:19,047
<b>Stop Gi-beom and capture Deuk-gu alive.</b>

658
00:56:19,130 --> 00:56:21,633
<b>We need to hand him over to the police.</b>

659
00:56:21,716 --> 00:56:22,925
<b>Why, sir?</b>

660
00:56:23,509 --> 00:56:26,012
<b>How can we spare a scumbag
who took so many innocent lives?</b>

661
00:56:26,095 --> 00:56:27,930
<b>I won't let your recklessness</b>

662
00:56:28,014 --> 00:56:30,725
<b>ruin everything we've worked up toward.</b>

663
00:56:32,226 --> 00:56:33,102
<b>Do as I command.</b>

664
00:56:36,689 --> 00:56:37,899
<b>Yes, sir.</b>

665
00:56:39,025 --> 00:56:40,360
<b>Capture Deuk-gu</b>

666
00:56:41,486 --> 00:56:42,737

667
00:56:43,321 --> 00:56:44,155
<b>Yes, sir.</b>

668
00:57:03,508 --> 00:57:05,009
<b>You've become quite fast.</b>

669
00:57:05,677 --> 00:57:06,552
<b>I wonder why.</b>

670
00:57:07,303 --> 00:57:08,262
<b>Artificial eyes?</b>

671
00:57:08,346 --> 00:57:10,682
<b>Or is it another body part?</b>

672
00:57:10,765 --> 00:57:12,684
<b>That's none of your business.</b>

673
00:57:13,559 --> 00:57:15,728
<b>First, I'll beat you to a pulp.</b>

674
00:57:15,978 --> 00:57:18,356
<b>After that, you'll rot behind bars.</b>

675
00:57:20,441 --> 00:57:21,734
<b>Before doing that,</b>

676
00:57:21,984 --> 00:57:24,987
<b>have you thought about how
you'd persuade your superiors?</b>

677
00:57:43,756 --> 00:57:44,757
<b>Everyone wants something</b>

678
00:57:45,591 --> 00:57:48,219
<b>bigger and greater than them.</b>

679
00:57:48,761 --> 00:57:51,514
<b>Isn't that why
you were brought back to life?</b>

680
00:57:51,806 --> 00:57:52,932
<b>It's the same for me.</b>

681
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:56,436
<b>I always have a reason
for killing someone.</b>

682
00:57:56,519 --> 00:57:57,895
<b>Thanks for your last words.</b>

683
00:58:59,081 --> 00:59:00,208
<b>I'll kill you now.</b>

684
00:59:12,595 --> 00:59:13,596
<b>What happened?</b>

685
00:59:14,972 --> 00:59:17,350
<b>The screen suddenly turned off.
This is impossible.</b>

686
00:59:25,107 --> 00:59:26,400
<b>Shut him down.</b>

687
00:59:28,152 --> 00:59:29,237
<b>He's currently in combat.</b>

688
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:32,448

he'll have if he gets shut down.</b>

689
00:59:32,532 --> 00:59:36,035
<b>If he doesn't shut down right now,
he'll suffer even greater damages.</b>

690
00:59:36,786 --> 00:59:37,620

691
00:59:40,248 --> 00:59:41,374
