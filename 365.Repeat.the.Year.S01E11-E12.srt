<b>(Episode 11)</b>

2
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:12,230
<b>I got the address.</b>

3
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:17,369
<b>The address was my shop.</b>

4
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:19,400
<b>What does this mean?</b>

5
00:00:25,809 --> 00:00:27,839
<b>Okay. I'll be there right now.</b>

6
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:37,949
<b>Ga Hyeon!</b>

7
00:00:46,189 --> 00:00:47,500
<b>(Flower)</b>

8
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,230
<b>Excuse me. Was this Ms. So Hye In?</b>

9
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,530
<b>Yes, she passed away.</b>

10
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:48,236
<b>It looked like there was a gas leak
from her heater.</b>

11
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:50,890
<b>We found soot on
the mucous membrane of her nose,</b>

12
00:01:50,989 --> 00:01:52,506
<b>so it looks like...</b>

13
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,976
<b>she first passed out from the gas,
then she suffocated her to death.</b>

14
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,476
<b>We'll have to conduct
an autopsy to be sure.</b>

15
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,016
<b>Could this have been arson?</b>

16
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,116
<b>There's nothing I caught
in particular,</b>

17
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,516
<b>but we'll know for sure
after the NFS gives us the result.</b>

18
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:07,256
<b>Please do give us a call
as soon as the results are in.</b>

19
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,840
<b>Sure, I'll call you.</b>

20
00:02:17,789 --> 00:02:20,189
<b>Do you think this happened
because we found out...</b>

21
00:02:21,189 --> 00:02:22,765
<b>about the flower shop?</b>

22
00:02:22,789 --> 00:02:24,689
<b>It was already addressed
to the flower shop.</b>

23
00:02:25,259 --> 00:02:27,675
<b>Ms. So Hye In could've been
the target from the start.</b>

24
00:02:27,699 --> 00:02:29,930
<b>But she didn't even reset.</b>

25
00:02:30,699 --> 00:02:31,969
<b>So why?</b>

26
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:34,270
<b>Whoever that ordered it will know.</b>

27
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:45,925
<b>Did you find out
what the flower baskets mean?</b>

28
00:02:45,949 --> 00:02:47,719
<b>You do know that...</b>

29
00:02:48,949 --> 00:02:50,449
<b>Ms. So Hye In passed away, right?</b>

30
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:54,135
<b>- Who?
- The pregnant lady you invited.</b>

31
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:56,259
<b>Hye In, who didn't even reset,
just died...</b>

32
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,129
<b>after she got the message
with those flowers.</b>

33
00:02:59,229 --> 00:03:02,360
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

34
00:03:07,069 --> 00:03:09,199
<b>Will you keep denying it
even after you see this?</b>

35
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:13,180
<b>The one who sent the flowers
was Ms. Song Ji Hyun.</b>

36
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:17,409
<b>Ms. Song.</b>

37
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:19,355
<b>You're here, Mir.</b>

38
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:20,449
<b>Yes.</b>

39
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,659
<b>We're closed for the day.</b>

40
00:03:30,789 --> 00:03:32,830
<b>I came to give you this.</b>

41
00:03:58,389 --> 00:04:01,889
<b>To be exact, I'm sure
Ms. Song was acting on your order.</b>

42
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,066
<b>I have no idea what's going on.</b>

43
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:05,960
<b>Why do you keep denying this?</b>

44
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:09,000
<b>You wrote excerpts from
"Pieces of Destiny" and sent it.</b>

45
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:12,699
<b>"Pieces of Destiny"?</b>

46
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,045
<b>("Pieces of Destiny")</b>

47
00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:17,009
<b>Ms. Song gave this to me.</b>

48
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:22,509
<b>We'll talk to her in person.</b>

49
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:26,209
<b>She suddenly quit yesterday.</b>

50
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:32,589
<b>This has never happened
in any other reset,</b>

51
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:34,735
<b>so I was quite flustered.</b>

52
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:36,730
<b>She said it was
for personal reasons,</b>

53
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:38,735
<b>so I couldn't pry anymore.</b>

54
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:40,629
<b>She disappeared...</b>

55
00:04:41,829 --> 00:04:44,470
<b>as soon as we found out.</b>

56
00:04:46,699 --> 00:04:48,139
<b>Is that what has happened?</b>

57
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:52,069
<b>I can't believe this.</b>

58
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,386
<b>She doesn't know
anything about these resets.</b>

59
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:57,910
<b>Are you 100 percent sure?</b>

60
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,120
<b>If she knows about Ms. So Hye In,</b>

61
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:03,519
<b>it means she also knows
what happened before the reset.</b>

62
00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:06,565
<b>There's no way.</b>

63
00:05:06,589 --> 00:05:09,536
<b>It's impossible for her to find out
unless I tell her.</b>

64
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,689
<b>What if you're lying?</b>

65
00:05:12,029 --> 00:05:13,435
<b>Then everything is possible.</b>

66
00:05:13,459 --> 00:05:16,600
<b>Since when were you
acquainted with Ms. Song Ji Hyun?</b>

67
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:19,000
<b>It has been a long time.</b>

68
00:05:19,329 --> 00:05:20,399
<b>It was...</b>

69
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,870
<b>Mom.</b>

70
00:05:26,509 --> 00:05:27,779
<b>Young.</b>

<b>Ms. Song Ji Hyun?</b>

<b>Is Ms. Song Ji Hyun here?</b>

86
00:06:31,009 --> 00:06:31,986
<b>One second.</b>

87
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:33,709
<b>- Right here?
- Yes.</b>

88
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,660
<b>I wanted to ask you something.</b>

89
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:02,245
<b>Were you on your way
to the sanitarium?</b>

90
00:07:02,269 --> 00:07:06,146
<b>Yes, I couldn't seem to
focus on my work.</b>

91
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:08,079
<b>Were you there yesterday too?</b>

92
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:10,550
<b>With your wife?</b>

93
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:13,250
<b>Yes, right.</b>

94
00:07:14,779 --> 00:07:16,220
<b>I was there with her.</b>

95
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,766
<b>Anyway, what was it
that you wanted to say...</b>

96
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,220
<b>At the time of the explosion,</b>

97
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,490
<b>Detective Ji and I were...</b>

98
00:07:24,189 --> 00:07:26,029
<b>in front of that flower shop.</b>

99
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,660
<b>And I saw you...</b>

100
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:31,569
<b>there.</b>

101
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:43,449
<b>Why...</b>

102
00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:46,449
<b>were you there?</b>

103
00:07:49,819 --> 00:07:51,189
<b>(Michael Clinic)</b>

104
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:54,259
<b>I know Ms. Song Ji Hyun very well.</b>

105
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,735
<b>She comes here once every week...</b>

106
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:58,665
<b>to volunteer.</b>

107
00:07:58,689 --> 00:08:00,600
<b>Then was she especially close...</b>

108
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,136
<b>to someone who's in this clinic?</b>

109
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,276
<b>I'm not sure.</b>

110
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:07,146
<b>She's probably close to
other volunteers...</b>

111
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:08,970
<b>that she was trained with.</b>

112
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:10,810
<b>- One second.
- Okay.</b>

113
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:17,026
<b>But there weren't
a lot of volunteers...</b>

114
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:18,555
<b>during the beginning of this year.</b>

115
00:08:18,579 --> 00:08:20,050
<b>What's the exact date?</b>

116
00:08:20,949 --> 00:08:22,396
<b>(January 14, 2019,
signed by Song Ji Hyun)</b>

117
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,995
<b>It was January 14.</b>

118
00:08:24,019 --> 00:08:27,266
<b>In other words,
exactly a week from today,</b>

119
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:30,305
<b>on January 11, 2020 at 11 a.m.,

00:08:30,329 --> 00:08:32,266
<b>to January 11, 2019 at 11 a.m.</b>

121
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:34,430
<b>Three days after the reset?</b>

122
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:35,860
<b>In that case,</b>

123
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:40,539
<b>what about this person?
Do you know her too?</b>

124
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:48,840
<b>She used to work here, didn't she?</b>

125
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,980
<b>I think she was a psychiatrist.</b>

126
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:55,995
<b>Does Detective Ji know this?</b>

127
00:08:56,019 --> 00:08:58,966
<b>No, I wanted to
check with you first.</b>

128

<b>I didn't want this
to be a misunderstanding.</b>

129

<b>Did you know that flower shop was...</b>

130
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:06,066
<b>- owned by Ms. So Hye In?
- No.</b>

131
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:08,460
<b>I was shocked when you just told me.</b>

132
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:11,799
<b>Then why were you there?</b>

133
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,039
<b>Mr. Hwang.</b>

134
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,610
<b>Well, do they know...</b>

135
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,679
<b>why a fire broke out
in that flower shop?</b>

136
00:09:25,509 --> 00:09:27,019
<b>Does this fire...</b>

137
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:30,120
<b>have something to do with you?</b>

138
00:09:34,289 --> 00:09:37,129
<b>I didn't want to
leave my wife in the sanitorium...</b>

139
00:09:37,529 --> 00:09:40,399
<b>when I realized
I don't know when I'll die.</b>

140
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,105
<b>I took her home with me to spend
at least a few days together.</b>

141
00:09:45,129 --> 00:09:47,200
<b>But that's when
everything went wrong.</b>

142
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,015
<b>That'll be 28 dollars.</b>

143
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:51,110
<b>All right.</b>

144
00:09:55,379 --> 00:09:57,879
<b>- Here you go. Keep the change.
- Thank you.</b>

145

<b>- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.</b>

<b>Wait.</b>

<b>Honey!</b>

<b>Excuse me,</b>

<b>No.</b>

<b>How did you come all the way here?</b>

154

<b>She was in the neighborhood...</b>

00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:59,686
<b>Mr. Choi Kyung Man's funeral.</b>

312
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:02,656
<b>And you checked Seo Yeon Soo
and Mr. Cha Jeung Seok's death...</b>

313
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,420
<b>yourself, didn't you?</b>

314
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:08,136
<b>We were on the scene
when Ms. So Hye In died.</b>

315
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,289
<b>(Flower)</b>

316
00:20:13,259 --> 00:20:15,436
<b>Mr. Park Young Gil
who couldn't make it here today...</b>

317
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,960
<b>is dead.</b>

318
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,900
<b>There was someone
whom we couldn't check.</b>

319
00:20:23,369 --> 00:20:29,255
<b>(Park Young Gil,
January 11, car accident)</b>

320
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:30,716
<b>So you're saying...</b>

321
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:33,156
<b>your elementary school friend's
alumnus' friend's cousin's...</b>

322
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:35,025
<b>sister's husband is Park Young Gil?</b>

323
00:20:35,049 --> 00:20:36,026
<b>So just check...</b>

324
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:38,995
<b>if he's on the death list
from car accidents on January 11.</b>

325
00:20:39,019 --> 00:20:41,720
<b>Exactly. Why do you need to check?</b>

326
00:20:42,859 --> 00:20:45,706
<b>I'll treat you to Korean beef,
grade two pluses.</b>

327
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:46,960
<b>- Two pluses?
- Yes.</b>

328
00:20:49,299 --> 00:20:50,500
<b>Let's see.</b>

329
00:20:58,039 --> 00:21:01,680
<b>Park Young Gil. Park Young Gil.
Park Young Gil...</b>

330
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,079
<b>He's not on it.</b>

331
00:21:03,509 --> 00:21:05,549
<b>He's nowhere in the death list.</b>

332
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:07,210
<b>He's not?</b>

333
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,049
<b>Hello?</b>

334
00:21:42,049 --> 00:21:43,250
<b>Who are you?</b>

335
00:22:06,809 --> 00:22:08,585
<b>We were born on the same day,</b>

336
00:22:08,609 --> 00:22:10,480
<b>but I guess we had
different days of death.</b>

337
00:22:11,349 --> 00:22:12,686
<b>I suggested
that we run a business together,</b>

338
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:15,190
<b>but he ended up dying like this
after he took up a driving job.</b>

339
00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:18,750
<b>I saw that
Mr. Park Young Gil's death...</b>

340
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:21,065
<b>wasn't registered.</b>

341
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:23,795
<b>Is there a story?</b>

342
00:22:23,819 --> 00:22:25,430
<b>It's all because of money.</b>

343
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:27,466
<b>When I went to file his death,</b>

344
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:29,900
<b>they told me I need to
pay back his debt at once.</b>

345
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:31,676
<b>I've been wondering...</b>

346
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,860
<b>if I should give up on
his inheritance or pay his debt.</b>

347
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,440
<b>Anyway, why do you need to see him?</b>

348
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,140
<b>By any chance,</b>

349
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:47,049
<b>do any of these people
ring any bells for you?</b>

350
00:22:52,019 --> 00:22:53,319
<b>I'm not sure.</b>

351
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:57,759
<b>I think his colleagues
would know better.</b>

352
00:22:57,829 --> 00:23:00,730
<b>We barely got some sleep at home,
and never really saw each other.</b>

353
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:07,400
<b>I'm not really sure.</b>

354
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,740
<b>Hey.</b>

355
00:23:12,339 --> 00:23:14,146
<b>Did Young Soo say
anything bad about me?</b>

356
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:15,240
<b>What?</b>

357
00:23:15,609 --> 00:23:16,980
<b>Young Gil died...</b>

358
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:19,450
<b>because of me.</b>

359
00:23:19,549 --> 00:23:20,825
<b>What do you mean?</b>

360
00:23:20,849 --> 00:23:22,619
<b>Wasn't it a car accident?</b>

361
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,180
<b>It was his day off,</b>

362
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:26,849
<b>but he had been delivering
in my area with my car.</b>

363
00:23:27,349 --> 00:23:30,390
<b>It was my daughter's recital,
so I asked him to fill in for me.</b>

364
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:38,069
<b>Then this is...</b>

365
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:40,670
<b>It's his car.</b>

366
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:43,740
<b>I've been driving it thinking
he left it behind for me.</b>

367
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:48,009
<b>Goodbye, then.</b>

368
00:24:11,869 --> 00:24:13,606
<b>Did you know that
Ms. Lee Shin has a kid?</b>

369
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:14,700
<b>So what?</b>

370
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,869
<b>You knew.</b>

371
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:19,186
<b>How much do you know?</b>

372
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:21,079
<b>Do you also know why she invited us?</b>

373
00:24:23,539 --> 00:24:26,755
<b>If you need information,
you need to pay.</b>

374
00:24:26,779 --> 00:24:29,150
<b>We're all about to die.
Why do you want money?</b>

375
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:33,595
<b>Then maybe I should
stop looking for that guy.</b>

376
00:24:33,619 --> 00:24:35,366
<b>I'm going to get
his facial composite tomorrow,</b>

377
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,519
<b>but should I stop here?</b>

378
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:47,799
<b>Why do you think...</b>

379
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:50,039
<b>those people died?</b>

380
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:52,716
<b>Do you think good people...</b>

381
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:55,140
<b>suddenly died without any reason?</b>

382
00:24:57,309 --> 00:24:59,049
<b>Are you saying
they paid for their sins?</b>

383
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,450
<b>I never said that.</b>

384
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:08,190
<b>You must have sinned a lot.</b>

385
00:25:11,529 --> 00:25:13,089
<b>Are you scared that...</b>

386
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:15,500
<b>you might be next?</b>

387
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:17,299
<b>Are you?</b>

388
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,426
<b>I like how quickly
you made this decision.</b>

389
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:41,095
<b>What do you need me to do?</b>

390
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:43,259
<b>It might be a little difficult,</b>

391
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,460
<b>and you may not understand.</b>

392
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:51,059
<b>But I will make sure...</b>

393
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,930
<b>I compensate you handsomely.</b>

394
00:25:53,069 --> 00:25:54,430
<b>I promise.</b>

395
00:26:13,549 --> 00:26:16,160
<b>The cooler of her refrigerator
for flowers became overheated.</b>

396
00:26:16,789 --> 00:26:18,690
<b>The circuit breaker got loose,</b>

397
00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:20,359
<b>so it didn't get shut off either.</b>

398
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:22,299
<b>Your wife misunderstood.</b>

399
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,206
<b>I can finally die...</b>

400
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:28,299
<b>on a clear conscience.</b>

401
00:26:29,069 --> 00:26:30,640
<b>Thank you, Ga Hyeon.</b>

402
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,216
<b>Thank you, Detective.</b>

403
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,116
<b>If something like this had happened,
you should've told me already.</b>

404
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:37,480
<b>What if this turned into
an arson case?</b>

405
00:26:39,309 --> 00:26:42,019
<b>He thought this over
many times as well.</b>

406
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:44,549
<b>He didn't want to
put you in a tight spot,</b>

407
00:26:45,049 --> 00:26:46,750
<b>so he couldn't tell you.</b>

408
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:50,765
<b>Hey, I'm very sorry.</b>

409
00:26:50,789 --> 00:26:52,829
<b>It's nothing for you to apologize.</b>

410
00:26:53,089 --> 00:26:54,390
<b>Anyway,</b>

411
00:26:54,859 --> 00:26:56,730
<b>did you find out anything?</b>

412
00:27:00,569 --> 00:27:02,500
<b>Not yet.</b>

413
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:05,269
<b>Goodness.</b>

414
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:09,079
<b>We're all living in fear
without knowing the reason.</b>

415
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,116
<b>Do you think someone
who knows everything...</b>

416
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:14,250
<b>thinks this is nothing
but fun entertainment?</b>

417
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,960
<b>- Thank you.
- Goodbye.</b>

418
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,559
<b>Ms. Shin!</b>

419
00:28:31,329 --> 00:28:32,960
<b>- Hello.
- Seung Min.</b>

420
00:28:33,089 --> 00:28:34,529
<b>What brings you here at this hour?</b>

421
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:36,829
<b>Well...</b>

422
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:51,525
<b>You suddenly said
you're taking a hiatus,</b>

423
00:28:51,549 --> 00:28:53,109
<b>so our company is in huge chaos.</b>

424
00:28:53,349 --> 00:28:56,119
<b>My team leader got mad at me
and blamed me...</b>

425
00:28:56,279 --> 00:28:58,119
<b>for not taking good care of you.</b>

426
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:01,019
<b>Gosh, that's awful of him.</b>

427
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:03,789
<b>I already said
I had personal reasons.</b>

428
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:05,430
<b>Is something going on?</b>

429
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:07,136
<b>I should know as your manager...</b>

430
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,436
<b>to cover for you and help you out.</b>

431
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,936
<b>That's why I'm here.</b>

432
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,505
<b>I already sent a few files,</b>

433
00:29:12,529 --> 00:29:14,740
<b>so you can continue to publish
for a couple months.</b>

434
00:29:15,069 --> 00:29:17,140
<b>Then will you return
within two months?</b>

435
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:20,069
<b>He asked me to make sure we
won't have to announce your hiatus.</b>

436
00:29:21,579 --> 00:29:24,210
<b>I'll talk to your team leader.</b>

437
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,309
<b>It's not your fault,
so don't be discouraged.</b>

438
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:35,759
<b>Please excuse me.</b>

439
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:40,529
<b>Hello?</b>

440
00:29:43,259 --> 00:29:44,900
<b>Ga Hyeon.</b>

441
00:29:54,609 --> 00:29:57,386
<b>You meet your boyfriend every day.
Isn't it okay to skip a day?</b>

442
00:29:57,410 --> 00:30:00,049
<b>This is my first
housewarming party ever.</b>

443
00:30:01,309 --> 00:30:02,995
<b>I pushed it back...</b>

444
00:30:03,019 --> 00:30:05,250
<b>until he had time to come.</b>

445
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:09,619
<b>I'll celebrate with you
in his place, so stop crying.</b>

446
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,640
<b>Anyway, why did you move?</b>

447
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,176
<b>Wouldn't it be better
to stay with your parents?</b>

448
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:27,569
<b>I'm mostly alone at home anyway.</b>

449
00:30:29,339 --> 00:30:32,410
<b>And it's reassuring to have
my boyfriend next door.</b>

450
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:35,019
<b>You should worry about yourself.</b>

451
00:30:35,079 --> 00:30:36,999
<b>Aren't you scared
to be alone in that huge house?</b>

452
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:39,159
<b>I'm a woman who draws
a knife fight every single day.</b>

453
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:42,720
<b>And I have good security
because that place is expensive.</b>

454
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:46,859
<b>You're so cool.</b>

455
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:50,599
<b>Ga Hyeon, you seem
just like my sister.</b>

456
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:56,000
<b>You're pretty, nice,</b>

457
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:59,009
<b>and smart, someone who's
too good to be true.</b>

458
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:01,940
<b>Well.</b>

459
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:05,410
<b>I get that pretty often.</b>

460
00:31:11,049 --> 00:31:12,619
<b>It must be pretty tough
because of that.</b>

461
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,789
<b>You always have to be the best.</b>

462
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:21,660
<b>You always have to
live up to other people's standards.</b>

463
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,829
<b>I looked up your interview,</b>
