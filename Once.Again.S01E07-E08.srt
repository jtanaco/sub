1
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:08,940
<b>I'll go back to university.</b>

2
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:10,679
<b>- What?
- What?</b>

3
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:12,756
<b>University? What university?</b>

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,580
<b>I'll study and transfer to
a four-year university.</b>

5
00:00:15,609 --> 00:00:17,380
<b>Mom. Dad.</b>

6
00:00:19,789 --> 00:00:22,396
<b>It's been my dream
to study child psychology,</b>

7
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:24,190
<b>so that's what I'll do.</b>

8
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:28,059
<b>I'll get my diploma,
become a certified psychologist,</b>

9
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:29,960
<b>and do what I love...</b>

10
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,100
<b>while being someone who's needed.</b>

11
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:35,600
<b>That's the only way
for me to love myself too.</b>

12
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:38,746
<b>Do you even know how difficult
it is to transfer schools?</b>

13
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:40,109
<b>You're being ridiculous.</b>

14
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,170
<b>Consider your age too.</b>

15
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:44,210
<b>Your brain won't be able to keep up.</b>

16
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,609
<b>Besides, you weren't
a smart kid in school...</b>

17
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:52,420
<b>I mean, your grades
were slightly below average.</b>

18
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:56,265
<b>Da Hee, it doesn't seem like
you're thinking rationally.</b>

19
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:58,036
<b>This isn't the right way
to deal with the shock...</b>

20
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,429
<b>from your annulment.</b>

21
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:02,466
<b>You're practically throwing
another grenade at us.</b>

22
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:04,100
<b>We're dying here.</b>

23
00:01:05,259 --> 00:01:07,305
<b>Just remember that
this is our last shelter.</b>

24
00:01:07,329 --> 00:01:08,399
<b>He's right!</b>

25
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:10,640
<b>I know that.</b>

26
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:13,670
<b>I also know that it's absurd
and that I'm not very smart.</b>

27
00:01:14,069 --> 00:01:17,609
<b>But that's why
I'm going to give it my all.</b>

28
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:20,480
<b>Please believe in me this one time.</b>

29
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:24,396
<b>I won't ask you to pay
for any of my classes.</b>

30
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,849
<b>I'll get a part-time job
and pay for them myself.</b>

31
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,049
<b>I just think...</b>

32
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:31,795
<b>it's my last time
to take this chance.</b>

33
00:01:31,819 --> 00:01:33,465
<b>So please...</b>

34
00:01:33,489 --> 00:01:34,689
<b>Da Hee,</b>

35
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:39,969
<b>I understand how you feel,</b>

36
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:43,275
<b>but your siblings are right.</b>

37
00:01:43,299 --> 00:01:45,700
<b>You know how difficult
transfer exams are.</b>

38
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:48,245
<b>Money isn't the issue. The timing...</b>

39
00:01:48,269 --> 00:01:49,510
<b>Go for it.</b>

40
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,810
<b>Go ahead.</b>

41
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:57,379
<b>If other people can do it,</b>

42
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,280
<b>so can you.</b>

43
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:02,890
<b>Na Hee is proof that
cleverness runs in the family...</b>

44
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,019
<b>and her grades...</b>

45
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:07,459
<b>were better than Joon Seon's anyway.</b>

46
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:10,129
<b>So just give it a go.</b>

47
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,069
<b>We'll consider it as something...</b>

48
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,699
<b>we should've made her do
10 years ago.</b>

49
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,599
<b>Mom...</b>

50
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,909
<b>It's just like you said.</b>

51
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:23,439
<b>Consider this as your last chance...</b>

52
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,439
<b>and do your very best.</b>

53
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:29,050
<b>So make a life for yourself...</b>

54
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:31,449
<b>that won't be
looked down on by others.</b>

55
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,949
<b>You can do it too.</b>

56
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,936
<b>My gosh, Ok Boon.
You couldn't be more encouraging.</b>

57
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,066
<b>Thanks, Mom!</b>

58
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:42,336
<b>I'll study my butt off...</b>

59
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,460
<b>and I'll show you
that it can be done.</b>

60
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,569
<b>Honey, what has gotten into you?</b>

61
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,075
<b>What do you mean?</b>

62
00:02:51,099 --> 00:02:53,840
<b>That wasn't like you at all.</b>

63
00:02:54,009 --> 00:02:56,086
<b>"Cut the nonsense."</b>

64
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:58,409
<b>"First an annulment
and now a new career?"</b>

65
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:00,810
<b>The old you would've
discouraged her immediately.</b>

66
00:03:01,509 --> 00:03:03,979
<b>I don't always
discourage our kids, you know.</b>

67
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,726
<b>It said on the news
that it's easier...</b>

68
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,319
<b>to change your nationality
than your level of education.</b>

69
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:11,620
<b>That's just how the world is.</b>

70
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:14,066
<b>Da Hee must've been
frustrated with it all too.</b>

71
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:16,336
<b>Is that really the only reason?</b>

72
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,460
<b>What other reason can there be?</b>

73
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,430
<b>Am I not allowed
to encourage her now?</b>

74
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,500
<b>Well, if that's the case...</b>

75
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,539
<b>I'm just sorry,</b>

76
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,169
<b>that's all.</b>

77
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,009
<b>Every child will frustrate you
in the same amount.</b>

78
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:38,280
<b>Ok Ja calls it the principle
of trouble conservation.</b>

79
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,849
<b>Out of all our children,</b>

80
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:44,219
<b>Da Hee has caused the least trouble.</b>

81
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,205
<b>She had to clean up
after her siblings...</b>

82
00:03:47,229 --> 00:03:49,560
<b>and tend to Na Hee
while she studied.</b>

83
00:03:50,259 --> 00:03:52,599
<b>We've never done anything
for her directly.</b>

84
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,306
<b>Our lack of expectancy...</b>

85
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:58,439
<b>could be the reason
why she never aimed high.</b>

86
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:01,270
<b>I don't want...</b>

87
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,110
<b>to see her be discouraged anymore.</b>

88
00:04:06,009 --> 00:04:09,680
<b>I want to believe in her
and let her do what she wants to do.</b>

89
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:12,819
<b>I'll encourage her
just like I should've years ago.</b>

90
00:04:14,349 --> 00:04:18,219
<b>Sure. Let's do exactly that.</b>

91
00:04:18,419 --> 00:04:21,235
<b>I guess parenting
keeps teaching us new things.</b>

92
00:04:21,259 --> 00:04:22,706
<b>- Gosh.
- Goodness.</b>

93
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:26,446
<b>I'd wish I could stop
being taught new lessons though.</b>

94
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:28,529
<b>- Turn off the light, will you?
- Sure thing.</b>

95
00:04:29,029 --> 00:04:31,615
<b>(Cohabitation Contract)</b>

96
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:33,870
<b>Okay, good. That's easily readable.</b>

97
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,649
<b>Since this is my space,
I can move around the furniture.</b>

98
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,350
<b>Sure thing.</b>

99
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:45,625
<b>Just memorize
the contract by heart...</b>

100
00:04:45,649 --> 00:04:47,420
<b>so that we don't get
in each other's hair.</b>

101
00:04:47,949 --> 00:04:49,766
<b>I'm more worried about you,
you know.</b>

102
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:53,889
<b>From now on, we both have
to clean and do laundry.</b>

103
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:57,105
<b>And we both know
you're terrible at housekeeping.</b>

104
00:04:57,129 --> 00:04:59,536
<b>Worry about yourself
and mind your own business.</b>

105
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,800
<b>That's right.
Why would I even worry about you?</b>

106
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,276
<b>Can you now go back
to your space then?</b>

107
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,745
<b>I'd like to get changed
and go to bed.</b>

108
00:05:08,769 --> 00:05:11,240
<b>Yes. Sure thing.</b>

109
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:17,949
<b>Unbelievable!</b>

110
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,250
<b>You've got to be kidding me.</b>

111
00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:24,696
<b>Hey! What... Why didn't you knock?</b>

112
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,206
<b>Don't invade my privacy.
We're not married now, you know.</b>

113
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:29,800
<b>Sorry. I left my phone out here.</b>

114
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:31,935
<b>What am I supposed to do then?</b>

115
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:35,245
<b>I need to use the bathroom
and the kitchen too.</b>

116
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:37,100
<b>Then at least knock.</b>

117
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,745
<b>I graciously let you
have the bedroom, didn't I?</b>

118
00:05:39,769 --> 00:05:41,939
<b>Okay, noted.</b>

119
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,649
<b>As if there's anything
I'd actually like to see.</b>

120

<b>What do you mean by that?</b>

121

<b>Na Hee, what do you mean?</b>

122

<b>Is it salty?</b>

123
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:14,670
<b>Gosh, it's perfect.</b>

124
00:06:16,939 --> 00:06:18,555
<b>I see you're awake.</b>

125
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:21,156
<b>You see, skipping breakfast

<b>Rolled eggs.</b>

129
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:35,935
<b>How soft.</b>

130
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:39,600
<b>The kimchi looks super crunchy too.</b>

131
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,279
<b>I could eat seconds and thirds.</b>

132

133
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:58,819
<b>Yes, you know how

134

- That's your problem.</b>

155
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,500
<b>Darn it.</b>

156
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,576
<b>I'll just dry them myself.</b>

157
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,670
<b>Hold it!</b>

158
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:24,970
<b>I bought the dryer,
so don't even think about it.</b>

159
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,250
<b>Good morning...</b>

160
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,820
<b>Hi, guys.
I see you're all here early.</b>

161
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,690
<b>What on earth are you wearing?</b>

162
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:49,360
<b>I just wanted to wear it today.</b>

163
00:08:50,259 --> 00:08:51,936
<b>There's no...</b>

164
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,346
<b>particular dress code
for doctors, right?</b>

165
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:56,306
<b>The government has been promoting
shorts at the office too.</b>

166
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:57,745
<b>You should wear something
like this too.</b>

167
00:08:57,769 --> 00:08:59,745
<b>Of course,
you can wear whatever you want.</b>

168
00:08:59,769 --> 00:09:02,039
<b>I actually find it stylish even.</b>

169
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:08,326
<b>Didn't we agree to go over
the research paper for the fall?</b>

170
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,426
<b>Where's the material?</b>

171
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:11,049
<b>In front of you.</b>

172
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:14,226
<b>- Good job today.
- You all did great.</b>

173
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,250
<b>Have a good day.</b>

174
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:18,960
<b>Gyu Jin!</b>

175
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:24,399
<b>What took you so long?</b>

176
00:09:26,129 --> 00:09:27,899
<b>What a nutjob.</b>

177
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,940
<b>How can she be this evil?</b>

178
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,470
<b>No, vicious describes her better.</b>

179
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:36,470
<b>What?</b>

180
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:39,456
<b>What are you mumbling about?</b>

181
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,155
<b>Why couldn't you have come earlier?</b>

182
00:09:41,179 --> 00:09:42,926
<b>I said I had a meeting this morning.</b>

183
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,655
<b>I came earlier than usual.</b>

184
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:47,926
<b>You woke me up
yelling that you needed a shirt.</b>

185
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:48,966
<b>Don't you have one at home?</b>

186
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:50,765
<b>I told you that none were dry.</b>

187
00:09:50,789 --> 00:09:52,135
<b>The others are at the dry cleaner's.</b>

188
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:53,505
<b>But you have a dryer at home.</b>

189
00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:55,265
<b>I can't use it today though.</b>

190
00:09:55,289 --> 00:09:57,605
<b>What do you mean? Is it not working?</b>

191
00:09:57,629 --> 00:09:59,000
<b>Don't ask.</b>

192
00:09:59,259 --> 00:10:02,076
<b>Why do you want to know
about my personal life?</b>

193
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,745
<b>What's with the temper?
Did you and Na Hee argue?</b>

194
00:10:05,769 --> 00:10:07,769
<b>I told you not to ask!</b>

195
00:10:09,169 --> 00:10:12,056
<b>Will you look for
an academy to study at today?</b>

196
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,679
<b>Yes, I'll register at the academy...</b>

197
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:17,019
<b>and look for a part-time job
while I'm out.</b>

198
00:10:17,419 --> 00:10:19,450
<b>Auntie, it's admirable.
I wish you the best.</b>

199
00:10:20,289 --> 00:10:23,226
<b>Your words couldn't
be more encouraging.</b>

200
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,436
<b>Thanks.</b>

201
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,796
<b>Then eat up.</b>

202
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:28,066
<b>You can't study
unless you're fit enough.</b>

203
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:30,535
<b>Look at you,
receiving special treatment now.</b>

204
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:31,635
<b>Good for you, Last One.</b>

205
00:10:31,659 --> 00:10:34,330
<b>You're right. Maybe I should
go back to school too.</b>

206
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,230
<b>Is there an age limit
to studying at college?</b>

207
00:10:36,429 --> 00:10:38,570
<b>Ga Hee and Joon Seon.</b>

208
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:41,740
<b>Don't call me Last One anymore.</b>

209
00:10:42,169 --> 00:10:43,679
<b>- What?
- What?</b>

210
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,639
<b>Don't call me Last One anymore.</b>

211
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,985
<b>The Last One is no longer...</b>

212
00:10:48,009 --> 00:10:49,456
<b>and I've been born anew.</b>

213
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,426
<b>I'd appreciate it
if you didn't call me...</b>

214
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:54,750
<b>by any nicknames that belittle me.</b>

215
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,460
<b>Why are you guys laughing?</b>

216
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:04,460
<b>Because you sounded so serious.</b>

217
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,830
<b>"Don't call me Last One anymore."</b>

218
00:11:07,899 --> 00:11:09,500
<b>"I've been born anew."</b>

219
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:11,615
<b>But we're so used to it.</b>

220
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:12,875
<b>Can't we keep calling you that?</b>

221
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:15,015
<b>Shut it and do as she wants.</b>

222
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:16,839
<b>I don't like hearing you
call her that either.</b>

223
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,326
<b>You'll be banned from meals
if you call her that again.</b>

224
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:21,855
<b>Mom, you're overreacting.</b>

225
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:24,620
<b>Why can't we call her that
when it's who she is?</b>

226
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,549
<b>Listen to your mom, you punks.</b>

227
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:30,096
<b>What if I called you
Loafer 1 and Loafer 2?</b>

228
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,190
<b>Gosh, no.</b>

229
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:32,559
<b>Got it, Dad.</b>

230
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:36,105
<b>Tell Mr. Yang to bring by...</b>

231
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:38,600
<b>a kilogram of pork on his way over.</b>

232
00:11:39,029 --> 00:11:41,000
<b>Why? Is it for Da Hee?</b>

233
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:45,169
<b>At this rate, we might have
an Ivy Leaguer on our hands.</b>

234
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,846
<b>I don't know if we should
let her get this part-time job.</b>

235
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:51,855
<b>Shouldn't she devote all her time
to her studies?</b>

236
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:55,355
<b>Can't you pay
for her classes instead?</b>

237
00:11:55,379 --> 00:11:58,096
<b>But this is what she wants,
so just let her...</b>

238
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,025
<b>follow her own plans for now.</b>

239
00:12:00,049 --> 00:12:02,125
<b>But still...</b>

240
00:12:02,149 --> 00:12:04,336
<b>You said you wanted to
believe in her and encourage her.</b>

241
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,166
<b>I'm sure that Da Hee
will do a good job.</b>

242
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:08,535
<b>She gets her tenaciousness
from me, remember?</b>

243
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:10,905
<b>Come on. Is that really the reason?</b>

244
00:12:10,929 --> 00:12:12,605
<b>Maybe you think
it's a waste of money.</b>

245
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:15,070
<b>Must you put it like that?</b>

246
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:17,645
<b>Am I really one to be that cruel
to my kids?</b>

247
00:12:17,669 --> 00:12:19,899
<b>My goodness, we're late.
Ok Ja will be angry.</b>

248
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:21,070
<b>Gosh.</b>

249
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,826
<b>Where are you going?
I thought we were running late.</b>

250
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:29,950
<b>Be quiet.</b>

251
00:12:32,049 --> 00:12:33,080
<b>My gosh.</b>

252
00:12:36,019 --> 00:12:39,460
<b>Hello! Yes, I'd like some.</b>

253
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,629
<b>Gosh!</b>

254
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:59,110
<b>Why is she even here?
I can't believe this.</b>

255
00:13:01,179 --> 00:13:04,796
<b>She's not a friend
but the bane of my existence.</b>

256
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,450
<b>My darn life.</b>

257
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:10,159
<b>I'm here to register
for the morning classes.</b>

258
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,019
<b>Please fill out this form.</b>

259
00:13:17,659 --> 00:13:19,936
<b>None of these jobs seem fairly easy.</b>

260
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,669
<b>All I need are the evening shifts.</b>

261

<b>(Looking for a part-timer,
from 5 p.m. to closing)</b>

262
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,539
<b>The work is never done.</b>

263
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:32,755
<b>I posted a job opening long ago,
but I didn't get a single call.</b>

264
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:35,350
<b>Did I even post it right?</b>

265
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:38,049
<b>My goodness.</b>

266
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,350
<b>I can't believe this.</b>

267
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,320
<b>She wants to transfer
to a university after all this time?</b>

268
00:13:45,889 --> 00:13:47,559
<b>Da Hee is unbelievable.</b>

269
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:52,129
<b>She didn't study when she had to.
How would she do that now?</b>

270
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:54,870
<b>I don't think it's a good idea.</b>

271
00:13:55,929 --> 00:13:57,546
<b>That's my other line, Ga Hee.</b>

<b>(Mother-in-law)</b>

00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:02,446
<b>Never mind.</b>

274
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:05,379
<b>Go on. I don't have to answer it.</b>

275

<b>Na Hee.</b>

<b>Hang on. What?</b>

277
00:14:09,179 --> 00:14:10,895
<b>You know there is a welcome party

278
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:11,950
<b>You have to come.</b>

279

<b>I really don't like team dinners.
Can't we meet some other time?</b>

<b>If you don't come, I'll be upset.
I'll see you later, okay?</b>

282
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,059
<b>All right.</b>

283
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:29,000
<b>I'd like to welcome

<b>- Cheers.
- Cheers.</b>

286
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:34,416
<b>Drink up.</b>

<b>I'm watching you.</b>

<b>Dr. Song, over here.</b>

<b>I'm sorry I'm late.</b>

292

<b>Gosh.</b>

293
00:14:46,779 --> 00:14:48,590
<b>I guess you do care

294

<b>It's surprising to see Dr. Song

<b>You don't like drinking, do you?</b>

298

<b>I don't really like alcohol.</b>

<b>Why?</b>

<b>Now that you're here,

<b>I really don't want
to drink this up.</b>

307
00:15:31,129 --> 00:15:33,135
<b>I will just take my time
and drink it slowly.</b>

308
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:35,299
<b>You can't do that.</b>

309
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:37,299
<b>You came late,
so you need to catch up.</b>

310
00:15:38,669 --> 00:15:39,740
<b>Drink up.</b>

311
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,885
<b>Bottoms up.</b>

312
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:46,610
<b>- Bottoms up.
- Bottoms up.</b>

313
00:15:47,409 --> 00:15:49,950
<b>Sir, I will drink it for her.</b>

314
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,480
<b>- Give it to me.
- Hey.</b>

315
00:15:51,549 --> 00:15:52,980
<b>Why would you step up?</b>

316
00:15:53,179 --> 00:15:56,365
<b>If someone is to drink for her,
it should be Dr. Yoon.</b>

317
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:57,789
<b>- Me?
- Sure.</b>

318
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:03,529
<b>Well... I don't mind
drinking it for her.</b>

319
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,029
<b>But I'm not sure if Dr. Song
wants me to.</b>

320
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,000
<b>Forget it. I'll drink it myself.</b>

321
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:37,600
<b>You scratch my back
and I will scratch yours.</b>

322
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,929
<b>Sir.</b>

323
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,200
<b>It looks great.</b>

324
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,970
<b>Good.</b>

325
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:58,549
<b>One more.</b>

326
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,490
<b>All right.</b>

327
00:17:12,529 --> 00:17:14,029
<b>- One more.
- Again?</b>

328
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,039
<b>That's good.</b>

329
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:20,809
<b>All right.</b>

330
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:28,309
<b>Wait, Na Hee.
You're drinking too much.</b>

331
00:17:52,869 --> 00:17:54,069
<b>Na Hee.</b>

332
00:18:00,339 --> 00:18:01,410
<b>Here.</b>

333
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:02,809
<b>Again?</b>

334
00:18:03,309 --> 00:18:05,680
<b>I can't.</b>

335
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:09,089
<b>I can't drink anymore.</b>

336
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:12,295
<b>- You hypocrite.
- What did you say?</b>

337
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:14,966
<b>It's romantic when I do it,
but an affair when others do it.</b>

338
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:16,735
<b>When you offer a drink
it's just for socializing,</b>

339
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:19,700
<b>but when I do it, it's being pushy
and causing a stir, right?</b>

340
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:23,730
<b>Just stop forcing everyone to drink.</b>

341
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:26,315
<b>It's already hard enough
to work at the hospital.</b>

342
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:29,240
<b>I don't want to be stressed out
from a team dinner.</b>

343
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:31,539
<b>When...</b>

344
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:36,079
<b>When did I force you guys to drink?</b>

345
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:39,019
<b>Just stay quiet.</b>

346
00:18:49,589 --> 00:18:50,735
<b>My gosh.</b>

347
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:51,930
<b>Na Hee.</b>

348
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,230
<b>Dr. Song.</b>

349
00:18:55,529 --> 00:18:57,946
<b>That's enough for the basic steps.</b>

350
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,815
<b>Now let's practice...</b>

351
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:01,616
<b>the moves with your arms.</b>

352
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,916
<b>- Okay.
- Okay.</b>

353
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,339
<b>You should pair up
with partners first.</b>

354
00:19:05,509 --> 00:19:07,626
<b>Married couples can be partners.</b>

355
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:09,426
<b>Do I have to do this with my wife?</b>

356
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:11,650
<b>I want to dance with
someone else... No, I can't.</b>

357
00:19:11,849 --> 00:19:13,180
<b>You fool.</b>

358
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,619
<b>I'm sorry, but it seems
I don't have a say in this.</b>

359
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,890
<b>For the rest of you...</b>

360
00:19:19,019 --> 00:19:20,990
<b>You two are partners.</b>

361
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,606
<b>And you two.</b>

362
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:23,900
<b>Excuse me.</b>

363
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,759
<b>I don't want to be his partner.</b>

364
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,406
<b>I'm here to relieve stress,
not to get more.</b>

365
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:31,876
<b>My gosh. I feel the same way.</b>

366
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,400
<b>I'd rather dance alone.</b>

367
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:35,585
<b>Why don't you just give it a shot?</b>

368
00:19:35,609 --> 00:19:38,109
<b>If it doesn't work for you,
I'll change your partners.</b>

369
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:40,009
<b>Let's begin.</b>

370
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:41,509
<b>Stand facing each other.</b>

371
00:19:42,009 --> 00:19:45,549
<b>Ladies, put your hand
on your partner's shoulder.</b>

372
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:47,690
<b>Gentlemen, put your hand
on your partner's waist.</b>

373
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:50,859
<b>And hold the other hand.</b>

374
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:55,490
<b>Look into your partner's
eyes passionately.</b>

375
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:58,206
<b>1 and 2. 2 and...</b>

376
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,406
<b>- Don't laugh.
- Three. Cha-cha.</b>

377
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:01,599
<b>- One.
- Ma'am.</b>

378
00:20:02,829 --> 00:20:05,716
<b>What should I do when her nostrils
are bigger than her eyes?</b>

379
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:08,740
<b>What? You fool.</b>

380
00:20:08,769 --> 00:20:10,285
<b>Look. They are even bigger now.</b>

381
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:12,480
<b>Just keep your mouth shut.</b>

382
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:15,025
<b>Get off. Let go of me.</b>

383
00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:16,509
<b>I'm not drunk.</b>

384
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,349
<b>I can walk straight.</b>

385
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:24,589
<b>Why did you drink so much
when you can't hold your liquor?</b>

386
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,960
<b>Go on ahead.</b>

387
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:30,490
<b>Look who it is.</b>

388
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:33,900
<b>You're my ex-husband.</b>

389
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:38,200
<b>Are you happy that you got divorced?
Are you?</b>

390
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,985
<b>Hey, will you stay quiet?</b>

391
00:20:41,009 --> 00:20:43,146
<b>You're the one
who asked for a divorce.</b>

392
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:44,809
<b>You punk!</b>

393
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,950
<b>Don't live like that.</b>

394
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:51,180
<b>How can love change?</b>

395
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:53,150
<b>You sly jerk.</b>

396
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,420
<b>We got divorced
because you live like that...</b>

397
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:58,190
<b>Gyu Jin, your taxi is here.</b>

398
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:02,230
<b>Hey. My goodness.</b>

399
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,099
<b>Gosh. Hey.</b>

400
00:21:07,329 --> 00:21:08,670
<b>Darn it.</b>

401
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,900
<b>Gosh. I didn't do this
even before we got divorced.</b>

402
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:34,059
<b>Darn it. My back is killing me.</b>

403
00:21:34,089 --> 00:21:36,089
<b>You lunatic.</b>

404
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,869
<b>She even falls off the bed.
What a sight to see.</b>

405
00:21:45,369 --> 00:21:46,640
<b>Look at her.</b>

406
00:21:47,369 --> 00:21:49,085
<b>She gets up herself now.</b>

407
00:21:49,109 --> 00:21:52,880
<b>My gosh. This is unbelievable.</b>

408
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:58,795
<b>Goodnight.</b>

409
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:00,720
<b>Gosh, it hurts.</b>

410
00:22:09,789 --> 00:22:11,359
<b>Mom, I'm going out.</b>

411
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:13,700
<b>Aren't you eating breakfast?
I'm cooking now.</b>

412
00:22:14,829 --> 00:22:16,376
<b>I don't have time.
Training begins today.</b>

413
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,116
<b>This movie has
a lot of great scenes.</b>

414
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,476
<b>I'll be on camera many times.</b>

415
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,616
<b>If this thing goes well,
I might be paid a lot...</b>

416
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,116
<b>for this movie.</b>

417
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,515
<b>I'll get you a mink coat then.</b>

418
00:22:25,539 --> 00:22:28,349
<b>Forget about a mink coat.
Just earn your own keep.</b>

419
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:30,956
<b>Mom, I'm going out.</b>

420
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,456
<b>I'm attending classes
starting today.</b>

421
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,049
<b>You should eat breakfast.
You can't study on an empty stomach.</b>

422
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:36,696
<b>I'll eat something
before I head into class.</b>

423
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,789
<b>I'm leaving.</b>

424
00:22:39,619 --> 00:22:42,430
<b>Grandma, I have class duty today
so I should leave early.</b>

425
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:43,759
<b>See you.</b>

426
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:47,569
<b>They should've told me
that they're leaving early.</b>

427
00:22:51,769 --> 00:22:53,970
<b>I always eat rice for breakfast.</b>

428
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:57,539
<b>Just eat it. I should get to
take it easy from time to time.</b>

429
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:01,150
<b>It feels like
I'm chewing rice stalks.</b>

430
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:03,710
<b>I said just eat.</b>

431
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,019
<b>- Eat.
- Okay.</b>

432
00:23:12,089 --> 00:23:13,565
<b>Good morning.</b>

433
00:23:13,589 --> 00:23:15,130
<b>- Hello.
- Hello.</b>

434
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,235
<b>- 1 and 2.
- Hey.</b>

435
00:23:17,259 --> 00:23:19,430
<b>Jeong Bong, that's a good punch.</b>

436
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:20,976
<b>- Is Mr. Jang in his office?
- Yes.</b>

437
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,606
<b>He's upstairs with Byung Heon.</b>

438
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:24,946
<b>Okay. Keep practicing. Stay at it!</b>

439
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,299
<b>- Okay!
- Okay!</b>

440
00:23:29,369 --> 00:23:32,140
<b>Joon Seon really gets on my nerves.</b>

441
00:23:32,509 --> 00:23:34,886
<b>Why is he so dim-witted?</b>

442
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:37,795
<b>Why does he act like a senior
when he's not even that good?</b>

443
00:23:37,819 --> 00:23:39,049
<b>Is he the CEO?</b>

444
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:41,990
<b>Is he the martial arts director?</b>

445
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:43,920
<b>I wish he'd act his age.</b>

446
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:45,565
<b>Or get wise and quit.</b>

447
00:23:45,589 --> 00:23:47,559
<b>You know how innocent he can be.</b>

448
00:23:47,829 --> 00:23:50,460
<b>That's not being innocent.
It's being stupid.</b>

449
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:53,976
<b>Let's be honest. Do you think
it's easy for me to keep him around?</b>

450
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,206
<b>He's old,</b>

451
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:57,369
<b>has a bad back
and is choosy about his stunts.</b>

452
00:23:57,599 --> 00:23:59,970
<b>To be honest, the kids
feel uncomfortable around him.</b>

453
00:24:00,099 --> 00:24:01,446
<b>And he's so nosy,</b>

454
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:03,470
<b>he gets in all their business too.</b>

455
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:05,039
<b>I wish he'd just fend for himself.</b>

456
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:09,386
<b>- Byung Heon, don't put up with it.
- What?</b>

457
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:11,025
<b>Speak up if you must.</b>

458
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:12,680
<b>- Mr. Jang!
- Hey, Joon Seon.</b>

459
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,220
<b>- Hello.
- Hi.</b>

460
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,720
<b>I have something to say.</b>

461
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:21,535
<b>I'm really sorry,
but I need to quit.</b>

462
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:24,235
<b>What? Why so suddenly?</b>

463
00:24:24,259 --> 00:24:27,005
<b>Every dog has its day, I guess.</b>

464
00:24:27,029 --> 00:24:29,745
<b>Someone offered to invest in me.</b>

465
00:24:29,769 --> 00:24:31,515
<b>It's this producer from Hong Kong.</b>

466
00:24:31,539 --> 00:24:34,686
<b>Apparently, he's really big
in the industry.</b>

467
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:37,956
<b>He saw some of the stunts I did...</b>

468
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,616
<b>and said I was awesome.</b>

469
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,956
<b>How can I refuse
when he offered to invest?</b>

470
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,109
<b>I should give it a go, shouldn't I?</b>

471
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:47,196
<b>I see. Who is this investor?</b>

472
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,220
<b>What?</b>

473
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,735
<b>There's someone called Tteok Hua.</b>

474
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:52,736
<b>Tteok Hua?</b>

475
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,936
<b>There's someone. Tteok Hua.</b>

476
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,535
<b>Anyway, I'm really sorry that...</b>

477
00:24:57,559 --> 00:24:59,529
<b>I have to quit like this.</b>

478
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:02,106
<b>I'll buy you a drink
when things are sorted out.</b>

479
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:03,575
<b>Let's stay in touch, okay?</b>

480
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:05,716
<b>- Okay...
- Good. See you.</b>

481
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,039
<b>- Bye.
- Take care.</b>

482
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:10,309
<b>I wonder how much he'll offer.
I have no idea.</b>

483
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,910
<b>Look up Tteok Hua.</b>

484
00:25:27,829 --> 00:25:29,329
<b>- Joon Seon!
- Joon Seon!</b>

485
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:32,906
<b>What do you two want?</b>

486
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:34,406
<b>We'll come with you!</b>

487
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:37,170
<b>We don't care for Action Art
if you leave!</b>

488
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,640
<b>- Joon Seon!
- Joon Seon!</b>

489
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:53,656
<b>- What, Mom?
- You took your sweet time.</b>

490
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,519
<b>Do you know how many times
I called yesterday?</b>

491
00:25:56,049 --> 00:25:58,136
<b>Sorry. We had
a team dinner yesterday.</b>

492
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,866
<b>What about your wife?
Did her dinner start at midday?</b>

493
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:02,366
<b>She totally ignored my calls.</b>

494
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:04,299
<b>She must've been busy then.</b>

495
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,606
<b>What? Is something wrong?</b>

496
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:07,075
<b>The part-timer suddenly quit.</b>

497
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:09,575
<b>I had a terrible time
running the cafe on my own.</b>

498
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:12,345
<b>I wanted to ask for help
and couldn't reach either of you.</b>

499
00:26:12,369 --> 00:26:14,176
<b>What's wrong with your wife?</b>

500
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,186
<b>Shouldn't she have called me today
at least?</b>

501
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:17,886
<b>What does she think of
her mother-in-law?</b>

502
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,616
<b>I'll really do something
if she keeps this up.</b>

503
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,740
<b>Mom, I'll...</b>

504
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,356
<b>Mom, I have a long line of
patients waiting.</b>

505
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:26,956
<b>I will, I'll come over
when I'm free.</b>

506
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:30,150
<b>Mom, I'll call you back. Bye, Mom.</b>

507
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:35,160
<b>It looks like things are
about to get real bad.</b>

508
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,970
<b>You must feel okay.</b>

509
00:26:42,869 --> 00:26:46,116
<b>No thanks to someone,
my back and shoulder still hurt.</b>

510
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:49,446
<b>You should've left me alone.
Why take me home?</b>

511
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:51,740
<b>I regret doing so right now.</b>

512
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,485
<b>Don't you go and get drunk anywhere.</b>

513
00:26:54,509 --> 00:26:57,279
<b>You're the type that could
get into trouble.</b>

514
00:26:57,349 --> 00:27:00,049
<b>Don't worry. I'll fend for myself.</b>

515
00:27:02,589 --> 00:27:04,920
<b>As if you can.
You almost spilled the beans.</b>

516
00:27:06,089 --> 00:27:07,119
<b>Wait.</b>

517
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:09,160
<b>Mom called yesterday?</b>

518
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:11,176
<b>Yes. She did.</b>

519
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,376
<b>Couldn't you have just taken it?</b>

520
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,769
<b>What for? Am I obligated to?</b>

521
00:27:17,329 --> 00:27:20,170
<b>She must've called
to make us come over.</b>

522
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,446
<b>Clause seven. Both parties
must attend family occasions...</b>

523
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:25,356
<b>like birthdays, national holidays,
or ancestral rites.</b>

524
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,686
<b>For other occasions,
prior notice must be given.</b>

525
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:30,750
<b>And they are attended
by mutual consent only. Right?</b>

526
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:33,319
<b>No, no, wait.</b>

527
00:27:33,579 --> 00:27:34,690
<b>Even so...</b>

528
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,226
<b>Come with me.</b>

529
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:39,920
<b>Let's just talk. Come with me.</b>

530
00:27:42,329 --> 00:27:44,029
<b>Let go of me.</b>

531
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,700
<b>Song Na Hee.</b>

532
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,706
<b>Let's amend a clause.</b>

533
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:49,670
<b>This might make my life crazy.</b>

534
00:27:50,299 --> 00:27:51,400
<b>Amend how?</b>

535
00:27:52,069 --> 00:27:54,916
<b>You know my mom hates it
when you ignore her calls.</b>

536
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,845
<b>Will you help me out here?</b>

537
00:27:56,869 --> 00:27:58,416
<b>Take a minimum number of her calls.</b>

538
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,380
<b>Why should I? The stress
she caused was terrifying.</b>

539
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:05,450
<b>Okay. Then how about this?</b>

540
00:28:05,579 --> 00:28:07,555
<b>We'll count the calls you take.</b>

541
00:28:07,579 --> 00:28:10,226
<b>When we sell our apartment
and split the profit,</b>

542
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:12,220
<b>I'll pay you more per call.</b>

543
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,166
<b>You're getting such great ideas.</b>

544
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:17,706
<b>How much will you give me?
About 100 dollars per call?</b>

545
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:19,136
<b>That's robbery.</b>

546
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,735
<b>I don't want to take her calls.</b>

547
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:23,075
<b>You sort out your own mom.</b>

548
00:28:23,099 --> 00:28:25,099
<b>Wait, wait.</b>

549
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:30,240
<b>Do you think I'm doing this
just for my sake?</b>

550
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:31,539
<b>I'm not.</b>

551
00:28:31,809 --> 00:28:34,426
<b>If you ignore her calls,
who do you think Mom will go to?</b>

552
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:37,656
<b>To us? No.
She'll go to your innocent mom.</b>

553
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,356
<b>What will you tell her?</b>

554
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:42,089
<b>"We got divorced and I have
no duty to take her calls, Mom."</b>

555
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,250
<b>You got divorced?</b>

556
00:28:45,319 --> 00:28:46,789
<b>- My gosh.
- Divorced?</b>

557
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,065
<b>When affixed with "to",
what was a verb...</b>

558
00:28:49,089 --> 00:28:51,436
<b>is still a verb, yes or no? No.</b>

559
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,835
<b>It's no longer a verb now.</b>

560
00:28:53,859 --> 00:28:56,005
<b>In English, what always
comes after the subject?</b>

561
00:28:56,029 --> 00:28:59,039
<b>I called because I saw
you're looking for a part-timer.</b>

562
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:03,640
<b>You hired someone already? I see.</b>

563
00:29:03,809 --> 00:29:06,509
<b>Okay, I understand. Thank you.</b>

564
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:12,049
<b>Oh, dear. It's not easy
to find part-time work.</b>

565
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:16,819
<b>Oh? Ms. Choi.</b>

566
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:18,495
<b>- Hi.
- Give me that.</b>

567
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:20,160
<b>- My gosh.
- I'll help you.</b>

568
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:21,960
<b>Thanks so much.</b>

569
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,359
<b>My part-timer suddenly quit.</b>

570
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,829
<b>This looks too heavy for you.</b>

571
00:29:30,569 --> 00:29:32,640
<b>I have nothing but strength.</b>

572
00:29:35,069 --> 00:29:36,109
<b>Yes.</b>

573
00:29:36,309 --> 00:29:37,446
<b>Shall I put them here?</b>

574
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:39,410
<b>No, around the corner.</b>

575
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:49,720
<b>There are a few more inside...</b>

576
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:59,005
<b>I'm done. Is that all?</b>

577
00:29:59,029 --> 00:30:00,730
<b>Thank you so much.</b>

578
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:03,275
<b>By the way, Da Hee.</b>

579
00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:05,745
<b>Since you're helping out,
could I ask for a favor?</b>

580
00:30:05,769 --> 00:30:08,216
<b>- Sure.
- I'm out of bananas.</b>

581
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,255
<b>Could you watch the cafe
while I get some?</b>

582
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:12,256
<b>Okay.</b>

583
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,285
<b>If someone comes in,
don't take an order.</b>

584
00:30:14,309 --> 00:30:16,426
<b>Just say fruit juices
are available today.</b>

585
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:17,956
<b>Shall I get the bananas then?</b>

586
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:20,196
<b>No, no. I have to buy
other things too.</b>

587
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,196
<b>I won't be long. Help me out, okay?</b>

588
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,166
<b>Okay. Don't worry then.</b>

589
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:25,559
<b>- See you.
- Bye.</b>

590
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:55,089
<b>An americano
and a vanilla latte, please.</b>

591
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:58,890
<b>An americano and a vanilla latte?</b>

592
00:30:59,019 --> 00:31:01,019
<b>That's 9 dollars 50. Thanks.</b>

593
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:05,230
<b>Take a seat
and I'll bring those over.</b>

594
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:08,446
<b>Da Hee.</b>

595
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:09,745
<b>You're back.</b>

596
00:31:09,769 --> 00:31:12,616
<b>A customer was
really craving a coffee.</b>

597
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,539
<b>I worked at another cafe
for over a year.</b>

598
00:31:15,809 --> 00:31:18,410
<b>Shall I make you one? Hot?</b>

599
00:31:21,809 --> 00:31:24,926
<b>My gosh. How did you manage to...</b>

600
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:27,595
<b>transform the cafe
in just a short while?</b>

601
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:30,890
<b>I just cleaned up
a few things I noticed.</b>

602
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:34,660
<b>So, are you all right?</b>

603
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:37,065
<b>I mean, we experience...</b>

604
00:31:37,089 --> 00:31:39,376
<b>all sorts of things in life,</b>

605
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,769
<b>but there must be some aftereffects.</b>

606
00:31:43,029 --> 00:31:44,275
<b>I'm fine.</b>

607
00:31:44,299 --> 00:31:46,976
<b>Thanks for your concern, Ms. Choi.</b>

608
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,910
<b>Sure. What about work?
Are you still on holiday?</b>

609
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,440
<b>No. I quit my job too.</b>

610
00:31:53,609 --> 00:31:55,910
<b>I want to transfer to a university.</b>

611
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:59,926
<b>Transfer? My goodness.
Won't your mom complain?</b>

612
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:01,466
<b>She might freak out.</b>

613
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:03,896
<b>No. I have her full support.</b>

614
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:07,535
<b>But at my age, I can't ask
my parents to support me,</b>

615
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:09,829
<b>so I'll work part-time
while taking classes.</b>

616
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:14,176
<b>Did you find work already then?</b>

617
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,575
<b>No.</b>

618
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:18,916
<b>I can only work in the evenings
because I study during the day,</b>

619
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:20,740
<b>and I can't find anything suitable.</b>

620
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:21,839
<b>You can't?</b>

621
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:27,386
<b>Well, seeing how I need
a part-timer right now,</b>

622
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:29,956
<b>and you live nearby,
we can arrange a schedule.</b>

623
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:32,180
<b>Would you care to work here?</b>

624
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:33,995
<b>Here? Really?</b>

625
00:32:34,019 --> 00:32:35,019
<b>Yes.</b>

626
00:32:36,549 --> 00:32:37,750
<b>You fools.</b>

627
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:41,059
<b>Why did you quit with me?</b>

628
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:43,529
<b>I lied about the investor.</b>

629
00:32:43,589 --> 00:32:46,575
<b>I quit because I couldn't
hang in there any longer.</b>

630
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:49,176
<b>I really have nothing at all.</b>

631
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,369
<b>We know that.</b>

632
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:54,940
<b>But Joon Seon,
you are too important to us.</b>

633
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:56,039
<b>That's right.</b>

634
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,186
<b>When no one would pay us,
saying it was about the experience,</b>

635
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:01,255
<b>you shared your pay saying...</b>

636
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,555
<b>we needed to make a living too.</b>

637
00:33:03,579 --> 00:33:06,825
<b>Hey. That was only natural
because we worked and deserve pay.</b>

638
00:33:06,849 --> 00:33:07,880
<b>No.</b>

639
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:11,166
<b>You're the only person
who thought that's natural.</b>

640
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:14,059
<b>Forget about that.
So, what'll you do now?</b>

641
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:16,606
<b>You ate and slept at
the action school.</b>

642
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:18,259
<b>Where will you live?</b>

643
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:19,775
<b>Do you have a plan?</b>

644
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:20,799
<b>Joon Seon.</b>

645
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,606
<b>When did we ever plan things
before causing trouble?</b>

646
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:26,775
<b>We'll think of something
while staying at a sauna.</b>

647
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:28,769
<b>You two are unbelievable.</b>

648
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,416
<b>Here's your sweet and sour chicken.</b>

649
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,339
<b>Yes, thank you for coming.</b>

650
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:38,055
<b>We sold all the chicken in stock,</b>

651
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:39,426
<b>so let's call it a night.</b>

652
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:42,025
<b>It's been a while since we
had that many customers.</b>

653
00:33:42,049 --> 00:33:43,525
<b>We should have days like this too.</b>

654
00:33:43,549 --> 00:33:46,019
<b>Who says we always
have to have bad days?</b>

655
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:48,630
<b>Mom, Dad, Auntie!</b>

656
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:50,335
<b>Da Hee, it's you.</b>

657
00:33:50,359 --> 00:33:51,606
<b>Why are you here?</b>

658
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:53,436
<b>To go home with you two.</b>

659
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,345
<b>- Shouldn't you be closing up?
- Right.</b>

660
00:33:55,369 --> 00:33:56,575
<b>Wait a few minutes.</b>

661
00:33:56,599 --> 00:33:58,539
<b>- I'll go pay for the peanuts.
- Sure.</b>

662
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:01,245
<b>I hear you enrolled
at an academy today.</b>

663
00:34:01,269 --> 00:34:03,069
<b>Go for it when you can.</b>

664
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:05,515
<b>Get into a better university
than Na Hee did...</b>

665
00:34:05,539 --> 00:34:07,456
<b>and make her eat her words.</b>

666
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,480
<b>Yes, ma'am!</b>

667
00:34:09,549 --> 00:34:11,819
<b>Mom, I even got myself
a part-time job.</b>

668
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,920
<b>It's close by
and the hours are perfect.</b>

669
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,489
<b>Is that so? Where is it?</b>

670
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:17,626
<b>Won't it interfere
with your studies?</b>

671
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:19,320
<b>Of course not.</b>

672
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:20,659
<b>It's at Ms. Choi's cafe.</b>

673
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,159
<b>- I'll be taking the evening shifts.
- What?</b>

674
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:26,099
<b>At Yun Jeong's cafe?</b>

675
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:27,659
<b>Are you insane?</b>

676
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,630
<b>Why would you work for her?</b>

677
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:33,369
<b>Why not? It fits my schedule
and the pay isn't bad.</b>

678
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,785
<b>I'm more than grateful.</b>

679
00:34:34,809 --> 00:34:36,316
<b>That's out of the question!</b>

680
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,769
<b>This is a joke.</b>

681
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:40,380
<b>Did she actually ask you
to work for her?</b>

682
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,356
<b>Yes, I met her on my way here...</b>

683
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:45,280
<b>and she was looking
for a part-timer.</b>

684
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:47,095
<b>She said she'd rather
give me the job than...</b>

685
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:50,526
<b>She'd give you the job?
Don't you know how cruel she is?</b>

686
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:51,920
<b>A few days ago, she...</b>

687
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:59,230
<b>Anyway, my answer is no.</b>

688
00:34:59,329 --> 00:35:01,260
<b>Don't you work there.
I don't approve.</b>

689
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:06,039
<b>Aren't they friends?</b>

690
00:35:06,139 --> 00:35:07,940
<b>Why does she hate her?</b>

691
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:09,570
<b>They've been...</b>

692
00:35:09,969 --> 00:35:12,139
<b>at each other's throats
since high school.</b>

693
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:15,280
<b>I guess you can call them rivals.</b>

694
00:35:15,579 --> 00:35:17,825
<b>Being the jealous type,</b>

695
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:19,456
<b>Yun Jeong has always been
mean to your mom.</b>

696
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,250
<b>There's bad blood between them.</b>

697
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:24,519
<b>You...</b>

698
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,360
<b>stay put.</b>

699
00:35:27,219 --> 00:35:29,829
<b>I'll deal with her myself.</b>

700
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:48,160
<b>(Episode 8)</b>

701
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:03,686
<b>I felt bad after hearing
Da Hee's story.</b>

702
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:05,879
<b>It really was a punch to the heart.</b>

703
00:36:06,809 --> 00:36:09,226
<b>Why would I waste money
on someone else?</b>

704
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,449
<b>I'd rather Da Hee
pick up the paycheck instead.</b>

705
00:36:14,579 --> 00:36:17,026
<b>- Ms. Choi...
- Gosh, don't be like that.</b>

706
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:19,789
<b>It's just the two of us,
so let's not be formal.</b>

707
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:22,590
<b>Okay. Fine, Yun Jeong.</b>

708
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:24,905
<b>Thank you for
looking out for Da Hee,</b>

709
00:36:24,929 --> 00:36:27,460
<b>but she won't be working here.</b>

710
00:36:28,359 --> 00:36:30,375
<b>What? Why not?</b>

711
00:36:30,399 --> 00:36:33,775
<b>I know we're friends,
but we're also in-laws.</b>

712
00:36:33,799 --> 00:36:36,485
<b>There's a certain wall between us.</b>

713
00:36:36,509 --> 00:36:38,515
<b>And just like you said,</b>

714
00:36:38,539 --> 00:36:41,985
<b>I'm also worried that
bad luck will...</b>

715
00:36:42,009 --> 00:36:43,649
<b>rub off her.</b>

716
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:45,250
<b>Hold on.</b>

717
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,926
<b>Did I say such a thing?</b>

718
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:49,766
<b>Yes, you did.</b>

719
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:52,560
<b>It was quite recent.
Did you already forget that?</b>

720
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,060
<b>Well...</b>

721
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:58,465
<b>Oh, that?</b>

722
00:36:58,489 --> 00:37:02,105
<b>I was only worried
about you, you know.</b>

723
00:37:02,129 --> 00:37:05,575
<b>Anyway, I'll let Da Hee know myself.</b>

724
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,040
<b>Consider that this never happened.</b>

725
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,045
<b>All right then.</b>

726
00:37:09,069 --> 00:37:10,939
<b>Ok Boon!</b>

727
00:37:11,769 --> 00:37:14,585
<b>Okay, fine. Let me be
a little more generous then.</b>

728
00:37:14,609 --> 00:37:16,909
<b>I'll give her a 20 percent raise.</b>

729
00:37:18,379 --> 00:37:21,849
<b>My gosh! This trash can
needs to be emptied.</b>

730
00:37:22,049 --> 00:37:23,719
<b>Fine then!</b>

731
00:37:25,049 --> 00:37:26,795
<b>Things are urgent for me too,</b>

732
00:37:26,819 --> 00:37:28,890
<b>so please help me out.</b>

733
00:37:32,189 --> 00:37:34,829
<b>So this isn't you being generous?</b>

734
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:38,829
<b>No, this is me pleading.</b>

735
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,116
<b>I really need the extra help.</b>

736
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:46,340
<b>You said you'll give her
a 20 percent raise.</b>

737
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,409
<b>Yes.</b>

738
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:55,620
<b>How dare she try to play me?</b>

739
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:02,360
<b>Did you and Na Hee
really get divorced?</b>

740
00:38:02,789 --> 00:38:05,006
<b>When? How?</b>

741
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:06,560
<b>Isn't it obvious?</b>

742
00:38:07,099 --> 00:38:10,506
<b>We signed the papers
and submitted them.</b>

743
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:11,800
<b>It took less than five minutes.</b>

744
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:15,340
<b>I'm in shock.</b>

745
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:18,409
<b>This is the most shocking news
I heard lately.</b>

746
00:38:18,539 --> 00:38:20,885
<b>Your actions are more shocking,
you know.</b>

747
00:38:20,909 --> 00:38:23,150
<b>I can't believe you slept there.</b>

748
00:38:24,349 --> 00:38:27,379
<b>Anyway, don't tell Mom
or the people at the hospital.</b>

749
00:38:27,419 --> 00:38:28,396
<b>Keep your mouth shut.</b>

750
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:31,050
<b>That's not the hard part.</b>

751
00:38:31,449 --> 00:38:32,659
<b>But are you sure about this?</b>

752
00:38:33,389 --> 00:38:35,566
<b>You got divorced in secret
but are still living together.</b>

753
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:37,460
<b>Is this the Hollywood style?</b>

754
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:40,635
<b>I'm not sure if this is
sophisticated or reckless.</b>

755
00:38:40,659 --> 00:38:43,969
<b>We couldn't lose out
on 100,000 dollars though.</b>

756
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:46,439
<b>Gyu Jin,</b>

757
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,385
<b>are you sure you won't regret this?</b>

758
00:38:49,409 --> 00:38:51,039
<b>Na Hee is a great person.</b>

759
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:56,979
<b>This isn't because she's not great.</b>

760
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:58,985
<b>Two great people can marry...</b>

761
00:38:59,009 --> 00:39:00,996
<b>but still have problems.</b>

762
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:03,349
<b>You either overcome them...</b>

763
00:39:03,389 --> 00:39:05,219
<b>or call it quits.</b>

764
00:39:05,289 --> 00:39:07,360
<b>Your sister-in-law and I...</b>

765
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:11,135
<b>I mean, your former sister-in-law.
Well, we called it quits.</b>

766
00:39:11,159 --> 00:39:13,930
<b>Former sister-in-law?
Must you be that cruel?</b>

767
00:39:14,199 --> 00:39:18,175
<b>This is why you shouldn't marry
so quickly after falling in love.</b>

768
00:39:18,199 --> 00:39:20,645
<b>Take your time
and weigh your options.</b>

769
00:39:20,669 --> 00:39:22,840
<b>Well, it's not my goal to marry.</b>

770
00:39:24,039 --> 00:39:26,280
<b>Is that so? Why?</b>

771
00:39:26,479 --> 00:39:28,615
<b>Managing my own life is hard enough.</b>

772
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:31,610
<b>I can't be responsible for
someone else's too. It's scary.</b>

773
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:34,395
<b>To be honest, I'm scared
that I'll change my mind...</b>

774
00:39:34,419 --> 00:39:36,226
<b>like you and Na Hee.</b>

775
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:38,895
<b>Even if I live happily with my wife,</b>

776
00:39:38,919 --> 00:39:40,936
<b>one of us will end up dying first.</b>

777
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,129
<b>The one left will wallow in sorrow.</b>

778
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:45,430
<b>Like Mom.</b>

779
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:50,199
<b>Marriage can only end
in pain if you ask me.</b>

780
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:51,699
<b>That's what I believe.</b>

781
00:39:52,569 --> 00:39:53,770
<b>You're not wrong.</b>

782
00:39:55,169 --> 00:39:57,545
<b>Why didn't you tell me that
before I got married?</b>

783
00:39:57,569 --> 00:39:59,355
<b>Would you have listened?</b>

784
00:39:59,379 --> 00:40:01,740
<b>You and Na Hee were
head over heels for each other.</b>

785
00:40:07,019 --> 00:40:09,519
<b>Gosh, thank you, sir.</b>

786
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,235
<b>Gyu Jin, are you all right?</b>

787
00:40:13,259 --> 00:40:14,920
<b>Can you make it home by yourself?</b>

788
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:18,790
<b>Of course. I'm not drunk, you know.
Who do you think I am? Na Hee?</b>

789
00:40:19,399 --> 00:40:20,839
<b>Must you speak ill of her like that?</b>

790
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:22,899
<b>Head home then. Catch.</b>

791
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,490
<b>Jae Seok.</b>

792
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,819
<b>Na Hee.</b>

793
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:50,529
<b>Wait, should I not be
so casual anymore?</b>

794
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,269
<b>It's hard for a third party
to know about someone's marriage,</b>

795
00:41:00,339 --> 00:41:02,100
<b>so it's not my place
to say anything.</b>

796
00:41:03,139 --> 00:41:04,586
<b>Still, I'm upset.</b>

797
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:07,339
<b>I really like the both of you,
you know.</b>

798
00:41:08,839 --> 00:41:10,055
<b>I'm sorry...</b>

799
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:12,125
<b>for making you witness this
the second you came back to Korea.</b>

800
00:41:12,149 --> 00:41:15,319
<b>I'd like nothing more
than to ask what happened,</b>

801
00:41:16,949 --> 00:41:20,220
<b>but I won't since
I wouldn't understand anyway.</b>

802
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,165
<b>Can I still call you
my sister-in-law though?</b>

803
00:41:25,189 --> 00:41:27,399
<b>That won't change
even though you get divorced.</b>

804
00:41:28,129 --> 00:41:29,406
<b>It doesn't matter.</b>

805
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:32,029
<b>We need to keep up the act
for the time being anyway.</b>

806
00:41:32,699 --> 00:41:34,675
<b>Me being back in Korea
is a secret...</b>

807
00:41:34,699 --> 00:41:36,639
<b>and so is Gyu Jin getting a divorce.</b>

808
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,069
<b>We're the secret-harboring brothers.</b>

809
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:43,779
<b>I know and I'm sorry for
playing a part in that.</b>

810
00:41:44,949 --> 00:41:46,995
<b>When you said you were
marrying Gyu Jin,</b>

811
00:41:47,019 --> 00:41:49,350
<b>I promised to always
be on your side.</b>

812
00:41:51,490 --> 00:41:52,490
<b>My arm...</b>

813
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:54,259
<b>Something's wrong with my arm.</b>

814
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:55,766
<b>Why? Do you have a cramp?</b>

815
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:57,536
<b>Unlike others,</b>

816
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:00,329
<b>the blood in me
isn't thicker than water.</b>

817
00:42:01,899 --> 00:42:05,629
<b>I'll always be on your side.</b>

818
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:09,540
<b>Call me when you're lonely,
when you need a friend,</b>

819
00:42:10,610 --> 00:42:12,980
<b>or when you need
someone to eat with.</b>

820
00:42:13,139 --> 00:42:16,110
<b>I hear that you're an outcast
at the hospital.</b>

821
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:17,610
<b>An outcast?</b>

822
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,620
<b>Didn't you know?</b>

823
00:42:19,819 --> 00:42:23,795
<b>Everyone says that you only
have Gyu Jin to eat with.</b>

824
00:42:23,819 --> 00:42:24,995
<b>Me?</b>

825
00:42:25,019 --> 00:42:28,165
<b>So you'll let Da Hee work at...</b>

826
00:42:28,189 --> 00:42:30,089
<b>Gyu Jin's mother's cafe?</b>

827
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,829
<b>Why not?</b>

828
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:34,459
<b>She needs a part-time job anyway.</b>

829
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:39,276
<b>Besides, you love money, right?
She offered a 20 percent raise.</b>

830
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:42,100
<b>Money isn't the issue here.</b>

831
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:44,045
<b>Wouldn't it be uncomfortable?</b>

832
00:42:44,069 --> 00:42:45,370
<b>Whatever.</b>

833
00:42:45,709 --> 00:42:47,355
<b>She seemed urgent,</b>

834
00:42:47,379 --> 00:42:50,509
<b>so I doubt she'll be
a menace to Da Hee.</b>

835
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:54,055
<b>Well, Da Hee isn't the type
to do anything wrong.</b>

836
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,079
<b>Exactly.</b>

837
00:42:58,250 --> 00:42:59,250
<b>My gosh.</b>

838
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:02,060
<b>Is it already that time of year?</b>

839
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:07,976
<b>Will you be going there tomorrow?</b>

840
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,329
<b>Of course.</b>

841
00:43:10,529 --> 00:43:13,276
<b>Let me come with you this time.</b>

842
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:16,639
<b>It's okay.
I'll just go there myself.</b>

843
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:23,026
<b>All right.</b>

844
00:43:23,050 --> 00:43:25,110
<b>Leave the store to me...</b>

845
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:28,579
<b>and make sure to be careful.</b>

846
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:31,425
<b>I'll cook some food
in the morning...</b>

847
00:43:31,449 --> 00:43:33,720
<b>and pack some fruit for you.</b>

848
00:43:57,879 --> 00:44:00,149
<b>(Song Young Suk)</b>

849
00:44:04,089 --> 00:44:09,060
<b>(Song Young Suk)</b>

850
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,970
<b>Is that where he went
early this morning?</b>

851
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:19,745
<b>Yes.</b>

852
00:44:19,769 --> 00:44:22,100
<b>Then he won't be back
until after sundown.</b>

853
00:44:23,769 --> 00:44:27,115
<b>I wonder how long he's
going to keep this up.</b>

854
00:44:27,139 --> 00:44:29,179
<b>Probably until the day he dies.</b>

855
00:44:29,309 --> 00:44:31,750
<b>I guess the pain
won't go away easily.</b>

856
00:44:31,909 --> 00:44:34,320
<b>He had to bury his sister
in his heart.</b>

857
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:37,720
<b>It's a miracle that he met you
and was able to settle down.</b>

858
00:44:38,419 --> 00:44:40,360
<b>Gosh, but still...</b>

859
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:43,529
<b>He lived his whole life
blaming himself.</b>

860
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:46,330
<b>It's about time
he lets himself off the hook.</b>

861
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:49,330
<b>He can be too cruel
on himself at times.</b>

862
00:45:20,799 --> 00:45:22,429
<b>Don't you want some, Young Dal?</b>

863
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:25,470
<b>I already ate.</b>

864
00:45:25,570 --> 00:45:26,799
<b>You can have it all.</b>

865
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:42,679
<b>Young Suk.</b>

866
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:44,789
<b>Don't you miss Mom?</b>

867
00:45:45,289 --> 00:45:46,659
<b>Should I sing her song?</b>

868
00:45:50,830 --> 00:45:58,669
<b><i>With my eyes closed, I walk</i></b>

869
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:04,385
<b><i>With my eyes open</i></b>

870
00:46:04,409 --> 00:46:09,340
<b>My cousin in Cheongdo
suggested it actually.</b>

871
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:13,525
<b>A family who owns an orchard needs
someone to babysit and do chores.</b>

872
00:46:13,549 --> 00:46:16,789
<b>I heard that age isn't an issue.</b>

873
00:46:17,549 --> 00:46:19,149
<b>I'm talking about your sister.</b>

874
00:46:19,350 --> 00:46:20,960
<b>Why don't you send her there?</b>

875
00:46:21,519 --> 00:46:24,666
<b>How much can you earn
polishing shoes anyway?</b>

876
00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:27,159
<b>She'll only starve by your side.</b>

877
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:29,200
<b>If she works there,</b>

878
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:31,500
<b>she'll at least get enough meals.</b>

879
00:46:32,029 --> 00:46:34,240
<b>They might even send her to school.</b>

880
00:46:34,539 --> 00:46:35,740
<b>What do you say?</b>

881
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:39,909
<b>No, I won't go!</b>

882
00:46:45,379 --> 00:46:46,679
<b>If you go there,</b>

883
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:50,350
<b>you can eat your favorite snack
every day.</b>

884
00:46:53,090 --> 00:46:54,519
<b>I don't want it.</b>

885
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:57,690
<b>I want to live with you instead.</b>

886
00:47:01,659 --> 00:47:02,929
<b>Young Suk, look at me.</b>

887
00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:06,899
<b>This isn't goodbye forever.</b>

888
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:10,086
<b>I'll earn enough money...</b>

889
00:47:10,110 --> 00:47:11,740
<b>and come back for you.</b>

890
00:47:12,039 --> 00:47:14,379
<b>I'll come to you before you see
100 full moons.</b>

891
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:15,855
<b>I promise.</b>

892
00:47:15,879 --> 00:47:17,049
<b>Really?</b>

893
00:47:18,850 --> 00:47:19,879
<b>Yes.</b>

894
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:24,090
<b>So stay strong
and wait for me, okay?</b>

895
00:47:24,850 --> 00:47:25,850
<b>Also,</b>

896
00:47:26,289 --> 00:47:29,019
<b>don't you ever skip your meals.</b>

897
00:47:30,659 --> 00:47:33,299
<b>Whatever food they give you,
you will eat it deliciously.</b>

898
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,159
<b>Got it?</b>

899
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:42,940
<b>Here is Mom's handkerchief.</b>

900
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:45,940
<b>Whenever you want to see us,</b>

901
00:47:47,179 --> 00:47:48,710
<b>you'll look at this instead.</b>

902
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:50,279
<b>Understood?</b>

903
00:47:51,210 --> 00:47:55,019
<b>Promise you'll come back for me.</b>

904
00:48:00,019 --> 00:48:01,090
<b>Of course.</b>

905
00:48:16,070 --> 00:48:18,009
<b>No one lives there anymore.</b>

906
00:48:18,539 --> 00:48:22,139
<b>The orchard went bankrupt.
They took off half a year ago.</b>

907
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:23,457
<b>Sorry?</b>

908
00:48:23,481 --> 00:48:26,655
<b>Creditors came by
and smashed everything in there.</b>

909
00:48:26,679 --> 00:48:29,155
<b>It was a nightmare.</b>

910
00:48:29,179 --> 00:48:31,466
<b>Then what about the people
who worked here?</b>

911
00:48:31,490 --> 00:48:32,950
<b>There was a young housekeeper.</b>

912
00:48:34,090 --> 00:48:36,265
<b>The young girl they hired
as a babysitter...</b>

913
00:48:36,289 --> 00:48:38,105
<b>who had a round face and puppy eyes?</b>

914
00:48:38,129 --> 00:48:39,206
<b>Yes, that's her.</b>

915
00:48:39,230 --> 00:48:40,500
<b>She died.</b>

916
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:43,105
<b>Was it last year?</b>

917
00:48:43,129 --> 00:48:45,570
<b>She had a high fever.</b>

918
00:48:45,870 --> 00:48:47,645
<b>I saw one of the workers...</b>

919
00:48:47,669 --> 00:48:49,799
<b>carrying her body
to bury her someplace.</b>

920
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:53,539
<b>I don't know
where they buried her though.</b>

921
00:49:02,519 --> 00:49:04,620
<b>You're still five...</b>

922
00:49:05,690 --> 00:49:07,720
<b>while I'm over 60 now.</b>

923
00:49:10,629 --> 00:49:11,889
<b>Young Suk.</b>

924
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:13,759
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

925
00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:17,769
<b>I'm terribly sorry.</b>

926
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:46,590
<b>I really must be an outcast.</b>

927
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:48,700
<b>Why though?</b>

928
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,529
<b>What did I ever do to them?</b>

929
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,316
<b>- Are you leaving?
- Yes.</b>

930
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:01,039
<b>- I guess I'll see you next year.
- Of course.</b>

931
00:50:09,850 --> 00:50:11,066
<b>Yes, Chi Su.</b>

932
00:50:11,090 --> 00:50:12,826
<b>Young Dal, where are you?</b>

933
00:50:12,850 --> 00:50:14,235
<b>I had an errand to run,</b>

934
00:50:14,259 --> 00:50:16,190
<b>and now I'm on my way back. Why?</b>

935
00:50:16,419 --> 00:50:20,076
<b>It's the day of the year
when you're most miserable.</b>

936
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:23,529
<b>Don't give your wife a hard time
and spend the day with me today.</b>

937
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,070
<b>I'll shut down my store.</b>

938
00:50:25,330 --> 00:50:27,269
<b>That's not necessary.</b>

939
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:29,269
<b>Just listen to your friend.</b>

940
00:50:29,539 --> 00:50:31,885
<b>I'll treat you
to something special today.</b>

941
00:50:31,909 --> 00:50:33,655
<b>It won't be just soju again.</b>

942
00:50:33,679 --> 00:50:37,009
<b>There's a place
I've had my eyes on.</b>

943
00:50:37,710 --> 00:50:39,049
<b>But...</b>

944
00:50:39,149 --> 00:50:40,750
<b>Unbelievable.</b>

945
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:42,855
<b>Mr. Shin, don't bother.</b>

946
00:50:42,879 --> 00:50:44,750
<b>It's on me today.</b>

947
00:50:46,649 --> 00:50:49,860
<b>I want to go out with her.</b>

948
00:50:50,629 --> 00:50:51,666
<b>How much will that be?</b>

949
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:53,035
<b>- Me?
- Yes.</b>

950
00:50:53,059 --> 00:50:55,405
<b>Sir, we don't do second rounds.</b>

951
00:50:55,429 --> 00:50:57,946
<b>Did you not see that
at the entrance?</b>

952
00:50:57,970 --> 00:50:59,846
<b>This isn't a place like that.</b>

953
00:50:59,870 --> 00:51:01,970
<b>No, I didn't see it.</b>

954
00:51:02,539 --> 00:51:05,446
<b>You're belittling me, aren't you?</b>

955
00:51:05,470 --> 00:51:08,686
<b>Where's the hostess?
Get the hostess!</b>

956
00:51:08,710 --> 00:51:11,710
<b>The hostess is right here.
How may I help you?</b>

957
00:51:35,399 --> 00:51:37,309
<b>Are you the hostess?</b>

958
00:51:37,409 --> 00:51:39,015
<b>Are you?</b>

959
00:51:39,039 --> 00:51:42,379
<b>Yes, I'm the hostess here.
What's the matter?</b>

960
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:45,149
<b>The thing is,</b>

961
00:51:46,009 --> 00:51:51,566
<b>this cutie says she doesn't want to
go out with me.</b>

962
00:51:51,590 --> 00:51:54,789
<b>Sure. That's true, sir.
We don't do second rounds.</b>

963
00:51:55,590 --> 00:51:57,765
<b>I've been in the liquor business
for 15 years...</b>

964
00:51:57,789 --> 00:51:59,836
<b>with my own principles.</b>

965
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:01,306
<b>I never water down liquor.</b>

966
00:52:01,330 --> 00:52:03,135
<b>I never overcharge customers.</b>

967
00:52:03,159 --> 00:52:06,169
<b>And I never let my employees
go out for second rounds.</b>

968
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:10,309
<b>You've got to be kidding me.</b>

969
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:13,115
<b>If you run your business like this,</b>

970
00:52:13,139 --> 00:52:15,115
<b>you'll never get regulars.</b>

971
00:52:15,139 --> 00:52:17,110
<b>Do you know who I am?</b>

972
00:52:17,179 --> 00:52:19,885
<b>There are a lot of bars...</b>

973
00:52:19,909 --> 00:52:21,895
<b>that ask me to come.</b>

974
00:52:21,919 --> 00:52:23,155
<b>Is that so?</b>

975
00:52:23,179 --> 00:52:25,326
<b>I'm sorry,
but we still can't do that.</b>

976
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:29,135
<b>Darn it.
You just don't seem to get it.</b>

977
00:52:29,159 --> 00:52:30,706
<b>If you keep being like this...</b>

978
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:33,265
<b>- I said no. Just go.
- What?</b>

979
00:52:33,289 --> 00:52:36,600
<b>Gosh, I said it three times.
You should get it by now.</b>

980
00:52:37,399 --> 00:52:38,905
<b>I don't know who you are,</b>

981
00:52:38,929 --> 00:52:41,515
<b>and I can make my living
without regulars like you.</b>

982
00:52:41,539 --> 00:52:43,340
<b>So go take your business
somewhere else, okay?</b>

983
00:52:43,509 --> 00:52:46,686
<b>You crazy wench.
Do you have a death wish?</b>

984
00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:48,039
<b>Shut your mouth.</b>

985
00:52:48,210 --> 00:52:50,886
<b>It's my principle
that I never skip a meal.</b>

986
00:52:50,910 --> 00:52:53,226
<b>I just finished serving customers
drinking in broad daylight.</b>

987
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:56,555
<b>I had to sing 14 songs
without having a meal.</b>

988
00:52:56,579 --> 00:52:59,396
<b>So I'm starving now.
Do you know what it means?</b>

989
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:01,696
<b>What are you talking about,
you lunatic?</b>

990
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:04,690
<b>It means you guys are dead meat.
Do you understand?</b>

991
00:53:05,329 --> 00:53:06,430
<b>Darn it.</b>

992
00:53:07,029 --> 00:53:08,700
<b>I'm going to kill you.</b>

993
00:53:18,039 --> 00:53:19,309
<b>My goodness.</b>

994
00:53:23,109 --> 00:53:24,755
<b>I'm telling you.</b>

995
00:53:24,779 --> 00:53:28,095
<b>He started throwing a tantrum,
so she had no choice.</b>

996
00:53:28,119 --> 00:53:30,226
<b>She didn't do anything wrong.</b>

997
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:32,265
<b>- It's okay. Stop it.
- Cho Yeon.</b>

998
00:53:32,289 --> 00:53:34,190
<b>You know I don't
like to make excuses.</b>

999
00:53:34,859 --> 00:53:37,660
<b>I'll pay if I did something wrong.
Otherwise, I'll be released.</b>

1000
00:53:38,059 --> 00:53:39,065
<b>Let's go, guys.</b>

1001
00:53:39,089 --> 00:53:41,035
<b>- Cho Yeon.
- Cho Yeon.</b>

1002
00:53:41,059 --> 00:53:42,359
<b>Wait. Gosh.</b>

1003
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:45,869
<b>- Cho Yeon.
- Cho Yeon!</b>

1004
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:10,505
<b>Here's your Americano.</b>

1005
00:54:10,529 --> 00:54:11,966
<b>Do you want a carrier?</b>

1006
00:54:11,990 --> 00:54:12,990
<b>Yes, please.</b>

1007
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:22,839
<b>I'm glad that I swallowed my pride
and begged her.</b>

1008
00:54:24,369 --> 00:54:26,646
<b>Thank you. Please come again.</b>

1009
00:54:26,670 --> 00:54:27,910
<b>Bye.</b>

1010

<b>Da Hee.
Would you turn the volume up?</b>

1011
00:54:31,910 --> 00:54:33,009
<b>Yes, Ms. Choi.</b>

1012
00:54:36,779 --> 00:54:39,025
<b>I'm not feeling well.</b>

1013
00:54:39,049 --> 00:54:41,535
<b>I will go get a massage

1014

<b>Take good care of the store
while I am away.</b>

1015
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:47,906
<b>And wipe the frame over there.</b>

1016
00:54:47,930 --> 00:54:49,000
<b>Yes, ma'am.</b>

1017

<b>She's nothing like her sister.</b>

1018

<b>I wish they were

1019

<b>I've missed this acrid fine dust.</b>

1020

<b>One must have freedom,

<b>Cho Yeon, here. I got you some tofu.</b>

1028

<b>This is ridiculous.
It's not like I was in jail.</b>

<b>Where's the sauce?
It comes with a sauce.</b>

<b>What was I thinking?</b>

1031
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:44,995
<b>Ga Yeon, you always make

<b>Pull yourself together?
How could you forget it?</b>

<b>Stop it. I can eat it without sauce.</b>

<b>There's a new talking bar
next to my store.</b>

1069
00:57:42,170 --> 00:57:44,609
<b>Apparently, the barmaids there are
young and slim.</b>

1070
00:57:45,470 --> 00:57:47,579
<b>I lost all my regulars to them.</b>

1071
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:50,926
<b>I've given them
a lot of free fruit over the years.</b>

1072
00:57:50,950 --> 00:57:52,726
<b>How disloyal they are.</b>

1073
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:55,980
<b>Dad. I should probably
lose some weight.</b>

1074
00:57:56,980 --> 00:58:00,289
<b>Like I always say,
appearance doesn't matter.</b>

1075
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:03,636
<b>Those who visit your bar
are hungry for emotion,</b>

1076
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:05,906
<b>not for bodies.</b>

1077
00:58:05,930 --> 00:58:09,136
<b>So you should try to fill
the void in their hearts.</b>

1078
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:11,005
<b>- It's...
- The teachings of Buddha,</b>

1079
00:58:11,029 --> 00:58:13,369
<b>so I should work hard with pride?</b>

1080
00:58:13,529 --> 00:58:14,970
<b>My gosh.</b>

1081
00:58:15,369 --> 00:58:17,485
<b>What kind of father...</b>

1082
00:58:17,509 --> 00:58:21,109
<b>tells his daughter to work hard
running a karaoke bar?</b>

1083
00:58:21,710 --> 00:58:23,910
<b>All occupations are
equally honorable.</b>

1084
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:28,519
<b>You should just live a life
that you're not ashamed of.</b>

1085
00:58:28,950 --> 00:58:30,380
<b>So what's the matter?</b>

1086
00:58:31,650 --> 00:58:34,295
<b>I guess you're here
because you have a lot on your mind.</b>

1087
00:58:34,319 --> 00:58:36,190
<b>Are you a mind-reader or what?</b>

1088
00:58:36,859 --> 00:58:38,835
<b>How did you know
that I have a lot on my mind?</b>

1089
00:58:38,859 --> 00:58:42,500
<b>I've raised you since you were six.</b>

1090
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:44,946
<b>In the small temple in Mount Daeun.</b>

1091
00:58:44,970 --> 00:58:47,146
<b>Gosh, I know that.</b>

1092
00:58:47,170 --> 00:58:50,339
<b>If it weren't for you,
I would've already been long gone.</b>

1093
00:58:51,140 --> 00:58:53,315
<b>I was abandoned with a fever,</b>

1094
00:58:53,339 --> 00:58:56,609
<b>but you fed me herbal medicine
for 10 days and saved my life.</b>

1095
00:58:57,180 --> 00:59:00,519
<b>And you took me in when I was
a fool who didn't remember anything.</b>

1096
00:59:01,349 --> 00:59:03,480
<b>You even let me call you Dad.</b>

1097
00:59:03,619 --> 00:59:06,349
<b>That's why I can tell everything
from your face.</b>

1098
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:11,660
<b>So Cho Yeon is distracted
with worries again.</b>

1099
00:59:13,289 --> 00:59:14,500
<b>Dad.</b>

1100
00:59:15,329 --> 00:59:16,359
<b>Monk.</b>

1101
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:19,646
<b>Maybe I should quit running the bar.</b>

1102
00:59:19,670 --> 00:59:22,745
<b>Why? You said
the work is cut out for you.</b>

1103
00:59:22,769 --> 00:59:25,716
<b>I just said that because
I had nothing else to do...</b>

1104
00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:28,309
<b>as a woman without parents
nor a decent education.</b>

1105
00:59:29,279 --> 00:59:32,279
<b>I'm just sick of dealing with
drunk customers.</b>

1106
00:59:33,309 --> 00:59:35,180
<b>I want to live an ordinary life...</b>

1107
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:37,789
<b>like normal women do.</b>

1108
00:59:38,690 --> 00:59:40,289
<b>I think it's time.</b>

1109
00:59:40,859 --> 00:59:42,160
<b>What time?</b>

1110
00:59:42,390 --> 00:59:43,720
<b>Time to move on.</b>

1111
00:59:44,430 --> 00:59:46,359
<b>Time to change your life.</b>

1112
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:48,630
<b>Time to get closer to the truth.</b>

1113
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:52,529
<b>Gosh. You're just saying things.</b>

1114
00:59:54,269 --> 00:59:57,769
<b>I'm just sick of living like this.</b>

1115
00:59:58,109 --> 01:00:03,440
<b>So what do you want to do
to make a living now?</b>

1116
01:00:08,450 --> 01:00:09,555
<b>Dr. Song.</b>

1117
01:00:09,579 --> 01:00:12,166
<b>I'm sorry. My work ended late.
Shall we begin now?</b>

1118
01:00:12,190 --> 01:00:13,420
<b>- Yes.
- Yes.</b>

1119
01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:16,235
<b>First, we organized the list...</b>

1120
01:00:16,259 --> 01:00:18,265
<b>of patients under age 18
with pneumococcus as you asked.</b>

1121
01:00:18,289 --> 01:00:21,730
<b>Hang on. Didn't I ask
Han Gi Yeong to do that?</b>

1122
01:00:22,730 --> 01:00:25,170
<b>Where is he, by the way?
Is he late?</b>

1123
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:29,676
<b>What? What's going on?</b>

1124
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:33,386
<b>Well... Did you not hear that?</b>

1125
01:00:33,410 --> 01:00:35,255
<b>Gi Yeong transferred
to Dr. Yoon's team.</b>

1126
01:00:35,279 --> 01:00:37,549
<b>What? Whose team?</b>

1127
01:00:37,910 --> 01:00:40,150
<b>I thought he told you.</b>

1128
01:00:42,750 --> 01:00:47,126
<b>Get data on antibiotic sensitivity
with the samples on page 29.</b>

1129
01:00:47,150 --> 01:00:48,196
<b>- Shin Hye Jeong.
- Yes?</b>

1130
01:00:48,220 --> 01:00:49,859
<b>Up to December of 2019...</b>

1131
01:00:56,430 --> 01:00:57,730
<b>What is it, Dr. Song?</b>

1132
01:00:58,029 --> 01:01:00,400
<b>Don't you see we're in a meeting?</b>

1133
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:01,740
<b>I see that.</b>

1134
01:01:02,039 --> 01:01:05,845
<b>I also see one of my team members
is here without telling me.</b>

1135
01:01:05,869 --> 01:01:07,886
<b>- Hey, Han Gi Yeong.
- Yes?</b>

1136
01:01:07,910 --> 01:01:09,255
<b>What are you doing here?</b>

1137
01:01:09,279 --> 01:01:10,980
<b>Well, the thing is...</b>

1138
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:12,849
<b>Han Gi Yeong.</b>

1139
01:01:13,710 --> 01:01:15,696
<b>Didn't you say
you talked to Dr. Song?</b>

1140
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:16,980
<b>Well...</b>

1141
01:01:17,150 --> 01:01:19,420
<b>I sent her an email...</b>

1142
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:21,196
<b>which she hasn't read yet.</b>

1143
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:22,460
<b>What? An email?</b>

1144
01:01:22,490 --> 01:01:24,190
<b>That's a notification,
not a discussion.</b>

1145
01:01:24,259 --> 01:01:26,065
<b>Come with me. Let's chat.</b>

1146
01:01:26,089 --> 01:01:27,190
<b>Dr. Song.</b>

1147
01:01:27,829 --> 01:01:30,406
<b>We're in a meeting right now.
Can you...</b>

1148
01:01:30,430 --> 01:01:32,029
<b>Stay out of it, Dr. Yoon.</b>

1149
01:01:32,299 --> 01:01:34,176
<b>Hey. Follow me.</b>

1150
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:36,200
<b>Don't be like this, Dr. Song.</b>

1151
01:01:37,470 --> 01:01:39,616
<b>Calm down. I'll talk to him later...</b>

1152
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:41,240
<b>Stay out of it, Yoon Gyu Jin!</b>

1153
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:48,126
<b>Did you have to do that
in front of our juniors?</b>

1154
01:01:48,150 --> 01:01:50,619
<b>You insulted me. Do you know that?</b>

1155
01:01:50,750 --> 01:01:53,420
<b>Should I do nothing when someone
takes one of my team members...</b>

1156
01:01:53,450 --> 01:01:54,660
<b>a week before the conference?</b>

1157
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:59,265
<b>I'll say it again.
I didn't take him. He came to me.</b>

1158
01:01:59,289 --> 01:02:02,735
<b>All he did for you was research
and data input in Excel sheets.</b>

1159
01:02:02,759 --> 01:02:05,805
<b>If that's all he had to do
when there are younger residents,</b>

1160
01:02:05,829 --> 01:02:06,906
<b>how would he feel?</b>

1161
01:02:06,930 --> 01:02:08,376
<b>That's why all the juniors...</b>

1162
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:09,640
<b>Treat me as an outcast?</b>

1163
01:02:09,740 --> 01:02:12,585
<b>I know. But what does that
have to do with you taking Gi Yeong?</b>

1164
01:02:12,609 --> 01:02:14,779
<b>I didn't take him!</b>

1165
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:17,140
<b>I thought he cleared it with you.</b>

1166
01:02:17,309 --> 01:02:19,485
<b>Is it over if he says it is?</b>

1167
01:02:19,509 --> 01:02:21,750
<b>You should've come to me.</b>

1168
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:24,595
<b>You know my team is
a member short without him.</b>

1169
01:02:24,619 --> 01:02:27,025
<b>I assumed
you'd gotten someone else.</b>

1170
01:02:27,049 --> 01:02:29,295
<b>Really? Weren't you just
trying to mess with me?</b>

1171
01:02:29,319 --> 01:02:31,589
<b>What do you think of me?
Am I like you?</b>

1172
01:02:31,630 --> 01:02:32,765
<b>You're not.</b>

1173
01:02:32,789 --> 01:02:34,636
<b>You and I are
fundamentally different.</b>

1174
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:36,799
<b>I'm not as crafty as you.</b>

1175
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:38,476
<b>You're always like this.</b>

1176
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:40,275
<b>You say you didn't know...</b>

1177
01:02:40,299 --> 01:02:42,069
<b>and stay neutral
without taking sides.</b>

1178
01:02:42,339 --> 01:02:44,886
<b>That is why I don't like you.</b>

1179
01:02:44,910 --> 01:02:47,416
<b>At work and between me and your mom.</b>

1180
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:48,716
<b>You're always like that.</b>

1181
01:02:48,740 --> 01:02:51,549
<b>That's why I divorced you.
Because you're crafty!</b>

1182
01:02:52,579 --> 01:02:55,555
<b>Anyone listening would think
you split up with me!</b>

1183
01:02:55,579 --> 01:02:58,966
<b>He wanted to eat dinner
and now he's not picking up?</b>

1184
01:02:58,990 --> 01:03:00,226
<b>Did he go home?</b>

1185
01:03:00,250 --> 01:03:01,565
<b>Why didn't you say so first?</b>

1186
01:03:01,589 --> 01:03:04,730
<b>I wanted to divorce you
for a long time!</b>

1187
01:03:05,059 --> 01:03:06,890
<b>Honestly, these two...</b>

1188
01:03:07,059 --> 01:03:09,660
<b>They swore me to secrecy
and now this?</b>

1189
01:03:10,359 --> 01:03:12,400
<b>Are they broadcasting
they got divorced?</b>

1190
01:03:14,299 --> 01:03:15,700
<b>Yes, it's me.</b>

1191
01:03:15,769 --> 01:03:17,845
<b>It will be rush hour soon.</b>

1192
01:03:17,869 --> 01:03:21,055
<b>I'll have dinner with my son
and come over in the evening.</b>

1193
01:03:21,079 --> 01:03:22,356
<b>Who cares?</b>

1194
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:23,785
<b>What's wrong with you?</b>

1195
01:03:23,809 --> 01:03:25,085
<b>What crazy timing is this?</b>

1196
01:03:25,109 --> 01:03:26,656
<b>It'll be bad if Mom hears.</b>

1197
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:28,325
<b>No, it's someone else.</b>

1198
01:03:28,349 --> 01:03:30,095
<b>- This friend is weak.
- No.</b>

1199
01:03:30,119 --> 01:03:32,549
<b>Who cares? She'll kill me
if she sees me here.</b>

1200
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:34,166
<b>No, wait.</b>

1201
01:03:34,190 --> 01:03:36,265
<b>Don't act like you're
the best in the world.</b>

1202
01:03:36,289 --> 01:03:38,259
<b>No. I must live.</b>

1203
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:40,390
<b>Okay. See you later.</b>

1204
01:03:44,230 --> 01:03:45,569
<b>Mom!</b>

1205
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,039
<b>What...</b>

1206
01:03:50,809 --> 01:03:52,609
<b>Are you Jae Seok?</b>

1207
01:03:52,940 --> 01:03:54,216
<b>What on earth...</b>

1208
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:57,309
<b>Why are you in a white gown?</b>

1209
01:03:58,109 --> 01:03:59,809
<b>Mom. I'm sorry.</b>

1210
01:04:00,109 --> 01:04:01,420
<b>I love you!</b>

1211
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:03,950
<b>You fool.</b>

1212
01:04:04,190 --> 01:04:05,950
<b>What happened?</b>

1213
01:04:06,190 --> 01:04:08,289
<b>Come here!</b>

1214
01:04:11,259 --> 01:04:12,890
<b>Come here!</b>

1215
01:04:14,859 --> 01:04:16,059
<b>Stop right there!</b>

1216
01:04:18,329 --> 01:04:19,400
<b>I got you.</b>

1217
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:20,799
<b>You little rat.</b>

1218
01:04:20,970 --> 01:04:23,916
<b>You're calling a son
you haven't seen in a while a rat?</b>

1219
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:25,640
<b>Isn't this too lavish a welcome?</b>

1220
01:04:25,769 --> 01:04:27,009
<b>What?</b>

1221
01:04:31,109 --> 01:04:33,710
<b>Mother. How have you been?</b>

1222
01:04:34,579 --> 01:04:38,190
<b>How do you think I am
now that I saw you here?</b>

1223
01:04:39,390 --> 01:04:40,426
<b>That hurt.</b>

1224
01:04:40,450 --> 01:04:43,660
<b>You must be really healthy.
Your punches are more painful.</b>

1225
01:04:43,859 --> 01:04:46,335
<b>Are you on something? Ginseng?</b>

1226
01:04:46,359 --> 01:04:48,359
<b>Ginseng? You idiot.</b>

1227
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:50,676
<b>Don't try to talk your way out.</b>

1228
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:52,775
<b>What happened? Why are you here?</b>

1229
01:04:52,799 --> 01:04:54,369
<b>What's this white gown?</b>

1230
01:04:54,470 --> 01:04:57,446
<b>Why ask? Can't you put
2 and 2 together?</b>

1231
01:04:57,470 --> 01:04:59,386
<b>I'm back and I work here,</b>

1232
01:04:59,410 --> 01:05:01,055
<b>and you found out. The end.</b>

1233
01:05:01,079 --> 01:05:02,585
<b>Isn't that simple?</b>

1234
01:05:02,609 --> 01:05:04,255
<b>What?</b>

1235
01:05:04,279 --> 01:05:07,450
<b>You scumbag. You jerk.</b>

1236
01:05:07,509 --> 01:05:08,726
<b>Come here.</b>

1237
01:05:08,750 --> 01:05:10,696
<b>Let's talk at home. Come with me!</b>

1238
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:12,390
<b>- Mom, wait.
- Come with me!</b>

1239
01:05:13,819 --> 01:05:15,295
<b>- Walk!
- Wait.</b>

1240
01:05:15,319 --> 01:05:16,920
<b>Can I at least change first?</b>

1241
01:05:18,559 --> 01:05:22,160
<b>I'll talk to Gi Yeong
about this situation.</b>

1242
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:25,230
<b>He won't talk to you.
He's too scared right now.</b>

1243
01:05:25,329 --> 01:05:27,616
<b>Forget it.
What good is such a timid kid?</b>

1244
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:29,045
<b>You keep him.</b>

1245
01:05:29,069 --> 01:05:31,210
<b>Okay. It would look bad
to send him back.</b>

1246
01:05:31,769 --> 01:05:34,839
<b>That's why you should
treat your juniors better.</b>

1247
01:05:37,079 --> 01:05:38,380
<b>Honestly, you...</b>

1248
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:40,049
<b>(Mother)</b>

1249
01:05:43,150 --> 01:05:44,650
<b>- Mom.
- Yoon Gyu Jin!</b>

1250
01:05:44,950 --> 01:05:46,396
<b>What's wrong with you?</b>

1251
01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:48,095
<b>Why? What is it, Mom?</b>

1252
01:05:48,119 --> 01:05:49,660
<b>"What is it, Mom?"</b>

1253
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:51,690
<b>You knew Jae Seok was back?</b>

1254
01:05:51,829 --> 01:05:53,706
<b>And you didn't tell me?</b>

1255
01:05:53,730 --> 01:05:55,900
<b>When you work at the same hospital?</b>

1256
01:05:56,259 --> 01:05:58,799
<b>You and your wife!
Come over right now.</b>

1257
01:05:58,970 --> 01:06:01,116
<b>- Even if the skies fall, okay?
- Mom, we...</b>

1258
01:06:01,140 --> 01:06:03,569
<b>- I'll come alone. Na Hee...
- Bring her too!</b>

1259
01:06:06,769 --> 01:06:08,210
<b>Mom knows Jae Seok is back.</b>

1260
01:06:08,279 --> 01:06:09,579
<b>She wants to see us.</b>

1261
01:06:11,180 --> 01:06:12,386
<b>Leave me out.</b>

1262
01:06:12,410 --> 01:06:14,186
<b>I have no reason to go there.</b>

1263
01:06:14,210 --> 01:06:15,456
<b>I can't do that.</b>

1264
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:17,696
<b>You're the one who
wants to keep us a secret.</b>

1265
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:20,890
<b>You should cooperate
to keep our cover.</b>

1266
01:06:21,059 --> 01:06:24,190
<b>Don't you remember
Clause seven of our contract?</b>

1267
01:06:35,599 --> 01:06:37,616
<b>That hurts, Mom. Mom.</b>

1268
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:39,916
<b>That really hurts.
Grab the other ear.</b>

1269
01:06:39,940 --> 01:06:41,480
<b>The other ear, please.</b>

1270
01:06:42,509 --> 01:06:44,755
<b>Just let go. I won't run away.</b>

1271
01:06:44,779 --> 01:06:48,250
<b>How can I trust you when
you lied about being in Turkey?</b>

1272
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:49,555
<b>Come in!</b>

1273
01:06:49,579 --> 01:06:51,325
<b>Okay, Mom, okay.</b>

1274
01:06:51,349 --> 01:06:53,349
<b>Mom. Mom.</b>

1275
01:06:53,490 --> 01:06:55,595
<b>Stop glaring. You're scaring me.</b>

1276
01:06:55,619 --> 01:06:56,960
<b>Tell the truth.</b>

1277
01:06:57,059 --> 01:06:59,160
<b>When did you come back, you brat?</b>

1278
01:06:59,289 --> 01:07:01,329
<b>Do you have to curse?</b>

1279
01:07:01,829 --> 01:07:02,806
<b>Not long ago.</b>

1280
01:07:02,830 --> 01:07:05,670
<b>I want a date. When did you return?</b>

1281
01:07:05,799 --> 01:07:07,946
<b>What time on what day?</b>

1282
01:07:07,970 --> 01:07:09,416
<b>Saturday. Last Saturday.</b>

1283
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:10,640
<b>Last Saturday.</b>

1284
01:07:11,569 --> 01:07:13,839
<b>That was a week ago.
It's been a week.</b>

1285
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:18,009
<b>And you started work without
telling me, you ungrateful brat?</b>

1286
01:07:18,980 --> 01:07:20,356
<b>"Ungrateful"?</b>

1287
01:07:20,380 --> 01:07:23,295
<b>You have no idea
what a noble sacrifice I'm making.</b>

1288
01:07:23,319 --> 01:07:25,565
<b>I deserve a Nobel Peace Prize.</b>

1289
01:07:25,589 --> 01:07:27,819
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

1290
01:07:28,190 --> 01:07:30,335
<b>- You scumbag.
- Mom.</b>

1291
01:07:30,359 --> 01:07:32,235
<b>- Mom, talk it out.
- You idiot.</b>

1292
01:07:32,259 --> 01:07:33,505
<b>Don't resort to violence.</b>

1293
01:07:33,529 --> 01:07:35,676
<b>That could become a habit!</b>

1294
01:07:35,700 --> 01:07:37,829
<b>- How dare you?
- Mom.</b>

1295
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:42,799
<b>- What?
- What?</b>

1296
01:07:43,299 --> 01:07:44,410
<b>You...</b>

1297
01:07:44,710 --> 01:07:45,710
<b>What?</b>

1298
01:07:46,009 --> 01:07:47,069
<b>You...</b>

1299
01:07:47,170 --> 01:07:48,186
<b>You...</b>

1300
01:07:48,210 --> 01:07:49,416
<b>Mom, we're here.</b>

1301
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:50,880
<b>Mother, we're...</b>

1302
01:07:52,910 --> 01:07:53,980
<b>What?</b>

1303
01:07:54,579 --> 01:07:55,680
<b>Da Hee.</b>

1304
01:07:56,319 --> 01:07:57,849
<b>Why are you here?</b>

1305
01:07:58,019 --> 01:07:59,119
<b>Na Hee.</b>

1306
01:08:04,930 --> 01:08:05,930
<b>You!</b>

1307
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:09,430
<b>What?</b>

1308
01:08:32,849 --> 01:08:35,619
<b>(Once Again)</b>

1309
01:08:36,019 --> 01:08:39,190
<b>What on earth did I tell
my brother-in-law's brother?</b>

1310
01:08:39,289 --> 01:08:41,376
<b>That really was not me.</b>

1311
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:43,636
<b>I didn't say it was just us.
I said we had drinks.</b>

1312
01:08:43,660 --> 01:08:44,769
<b>What?</b>

1313
01:08:44,970 --> 01:08:48,299
<b>Do you think you'll never
need to ask me for a favor?</b>

1314
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:51,186
<b>I wasn't blessed with
a good husband or great kids,</b>

1315
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:53,509
<b>but I was blessed with
a great son-in-law.</b>

1316
01:08:54,269 --> 01:08:56,856
<b>What, what? What is it?</b>

1317
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:58,109
<b>- For real?
- For real?</b>

1318
01:08:58,210 --> 01:09:00,779
<b>I'm going to quit
and do something else.</b>

1319
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:02,650
<b>Something ordinary.</b>
