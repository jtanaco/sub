(Jung Hae In)

00:00:24.503 --> 00:00:25.814
(Chae Soo Bin)

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.760
(Lee Ha Na)

00:00:34.369 --> 00:00:36.417
(Kim Sung Kyu)

00:00:44.661 --> 00:00:46.809
(A Piece of Your Mind)

00:01:29.832 --> 00:01:31.466
Do you remember this song?

00:01:31.592 --> 00:01:33.401
Erik Satie's "Je te veux".

00:01:33.401 --> 00:01:35.832
It was composed in 1891...

00:01:35.832 --> 00:01:37.006
Stop.

00:01:38.852 --> 00:01:40.266
Stop the music.

00:01:45.121 --> 00:01:46.162
(Ha Won)

00:01:46.162 --> 00:01:47.731
Who are you?

00:01:47.731 --> 00:01:49.377
I am Ha Won.

00:01:50.531 --> 00:01:52.746
No, no.

00:01:53.132 --> 00:01:56.472
If I ask Ha Won who he is,

00:01:56.472 --> 00:01:59.141
he should get annoyed and ask...

00:01:59.141 --> 00:02:02.712
if something's wrong with me. That's how Ha Won would react,

00:02:02.712 --> 00:02:05.826
not "I am Ha Won."

00:02:06.251 --> 00:02:07.787
Listen up.

00:02:08.951 --> 00:02:12.891
You are a conversation device with Ha Won's character and emotions.

00:02:12.891 --> 00:02:16.761
So you need to carry on a conversation like him.

00:02:16.761 --> 00:02:19.407
You're worse than Siri right now.

00:02:20.432 --> 00:02:22.136
I hurt your pride, right?

00:02:22.231 --> 00:02:24.306
Mine is hurt too.

00:02:25.231 --> 00:02:28.170
Why won't he come in? It has been days already.

00:02:28.171 --> 00:02:30.517
Please ask one question at a time.

00:02:30.871 --> 00:02:32.317
Enough.

00:02:32.772 --> 00:02:34.572
You scared me. What's up?

00:02:34.572 --> 00:02:36.641
I'm sure I heard Chief Ha Won's voice.

00:02:36.641 --> 00:02:38.086
He's over there.

00:02:38.951 --> 00:02:40.352
I haven't seen that before.

00:02:40.352 --> 00:02:42.996
Are you two developing something alone again?

00:02:43.151 --> 00:02:44.522
When will you share it with us?

00:02:44.522 --> 00:02:46.897
It's not good enough yet.

00:02:47.792 --> 00:02:49.037
Get to the meeting.

00:02:50.222 --> 00:02:52.261
They connected DNA and the medical field...

00:02:52.261 --> 00:02:54.891
to create "network medicine".

00:02:54.891 --> 00:02:56.436
- Here. - AH...

00:02:56.662 --> 00:02:58.062
- uses AI... - Thanks.

00:02:58.062 --> 00:03:01.972
and leads the medical research platform industry.

00:03:01.972 --> 00:03:03.216
Pause.

00:03:04.141 --> 00:03:05.271
Remove my image.

00:03:05.271 --> 00:03:07.872
The hospital requested that we include it.

00:03:07.872 --> 00:03:09.186
Remove it.

00:03:10.382 --> 00:03:12.526
I'll replace it with Mr. Kim's image.

00:03:14.581 --> 00:03:17.496
And leads the medical research platform industry.

00:03:18.581 --> 00:03:21.351
The previous one looked much better.

00:03:21.352 --> 00:03:23.397
But it looks credible.

00:03:23.961 --> 00:03:26.331
What's the accuracy for the psychological evaluation?

00:03:26.331 --> 00:03:28.036
It's 93 percent.

00:03:28.162 --> 00:03:30.861
If an AI can diagnose patients at a 93-percent accuracy,

00:03:30.861 --> 00:03:32.707
that's practically the best in the world.

00:03:36.801 --> 00:03:39.542
What? Your character and emotions?

00:03:39.542 --> 00:03:42.617
As if. Not even close.

00:03:45.282 --> 00:03:46.626
Look.

00:03:47.152 --> 00:03:50.551
Up until now, computers were adapted...

00:03:50.551 --> 00:03:53.526
to individuals using the average person's emotions.

00:03:53.622 --> 00:03:56.761
But you inputted an individual's emotions into that.

00:03:56.761 --> 00:03:59.637
This is a huge accomplishment. Seriously.

00:03:59.991 --> 00:04:01.506
But it won't work.

00:04:02.632 --> 00:04:04.731
The only way is through dialogue.

00:04:04.731 --> 00:04:06.902
It wouldn't work with me, so I thought it would work with you.

00:04:06.902 --> 00:04:09.442
It won't work. I took that with me everywhere...

00:04:09.442 --> 00:04:12.542
and talked to it for four days straight.

00:04:12.542 --> 00:04:14.141
We haven't found the point of reaction yet.

00:04:14.141 --> 00:04:16.812
Exactly. What exactly is the point of reaction?

00:04:16.812 --> 00:04:21.126
When and how, at what point will it become you?

00:04:21.152 --> 00:04:23.656
What will make this machine you?

00:04:24.951 --> 00:04:26.622
It'll find it on its own.

00:04:26.622 --> 00:04:29.367
If we can't figure out its point of reaction,

00:04:31.722 --> 00:04:32.867
it's a fail.

00:04:34.792 --> 00:04:36.107
Good luck with it.

00:04:46.442 --> 00:04:50.056

(Episode 1)

00:06:47.231 --> 00:06:48.407
What is it?

00:06:48.902 --> 00:06:50.436
I followed the music.

00:06:52.731 --> 00:06:55.917
The money-grubbing landlord is getting rid of the studio itself.

00:07:07.652 --> 00:07:09.857
Let's start again from here.

00:07:17.061 --> 00:07:18.196
Good day.

00:07:19.962 --> 00:07:22.436
Keep the door open so more people can hear it.

00:07:23.032 --> 00:07:25.107
This is the last song we recorded here.

00:07:57.561 --> 00:07:58.737
Goodbye.

00:08:14.481 --> 00:08:15.797
It's raining.

00:08:25.592 --> 00:08:27.607
I want to stay a little longer.

00:09:21.681 --> 00:09:24.057
(For sale or rent)

00:09:25.792 --> 00:09:27.567
The thunder is so loud.

00:10:09.902 --> 00:10:11.107
Four o'clock in the afternoon.

00:10:11.662 --> 00:10:13.207
It's daytime, but it's dark.

00:10:14.372 --> 00:10:15.607
Norway.

00:10:16.402 --> 00:10:17.577
Oslo.

00:10:18.542 --> 00:10:19.847
The forest on the way home from school.

00:10:20.341 --> 00:10:21.886
Dark afternoons.

00:10:22.642 --> 00:10:23.857
Do you remember?

00:10:34.792 --> 00:10:36.367
Ji Soo used to get scared.

00:10:49.772 --> 00:10:52.746
By the time we walked through the forest on our way from school,

00:10:53.412 --> 00:10:54.786
it was 3:20pm.

00:10:56.282 --> 00:10:57.817
It became dark in an instant.

00:11:27.872 --> 00:11:29.786
Ji Soo named it...

00:11:34.512 --> 00:11:37.296
- Nightlike afternoon. - Nightlike afternoon.

(If interested in the items, please call the number below)

00:12:26.593 --> 00:12:27.738
So what was the point of reaction?

00:12:28.193 --> 00:12:29.508
- Lightning. - Light...

00:12:30.762 --> 00:12:32.067
Lightning? That's so random.

00:12:32.663 --> 00:12:33.977
He did it his way.

00:12:36.433 --> 00:12:37.677
But it's...

00:12:39.573 --> 00:12:41.778
- How should I put it? - Hoon.

00:12:42.573 --> 00:12:43.888
It's what?

00:12:48.142 --> 00:12:52.158
Since it's advanced, let me ask something I'm really curious about.

00:12:55.953 --> 00:12:57.628
Do you still love Kim Ji Soo?

00:13:01.122 --> 00:13:04.463
AH Lab combines and derives patterns from...

00:13:04.463 --> 00:13:06.762
math, medicine, science, and humanities.

00:13:06.762 --> 00:13:09.548
It has developed a distinctive linearized network system.

00:13:11.002 --> 00:13:12.378
Time has passed,

00:13:13.002 --> 00:13:15.217
and the way of longing for her has changed a little.

00:13:17.112 --> 00:13:18.947
Except that it feels a bit hollow,

00:13:19.782 --> 00:13:21.057
everything is still the same.

00:13:42.732 --> 00:13:43.933
Mr. Park.

00:13:43.933 --> 00:13:45.473
These trees are so nice.

00:13:45.473 --> 00:13:47.418
They're getting nicer and nicer.

00:13:48.343 --> 00:13:50.272
Oh my goodness!

00:13:50.272 --> 00:13:51.272
Are you okay?

00:13:51.272 --> 00:13:52.742
I'm okay.

00:13:52.742 --> 00:13:56.427
Oh, dear. You guys must not be okay.

00:13:57.282 --> 00:14:00.683
My goodness. I'm sure I'm not in my right mind.

00:14:00.683 --> 00:14:02.522
What in the world did I trip on?

00:14:02.522 --> 00:14:05.022
Get up, guys.

00:14:05.022 --> 00:14:07.798
Goodness, I'm hopeless.

00:14:08.022 --> 00:14:10.738
This is so exhausting.

00:14:38.193 --> 00:14:40.197
Hi, Uncle.

00:14:40.762 --> 00:14:41.898
What?

00:14:43.333 --> 00:14:44.967
When did you come?

00:15:22.933 --> 00:15:24.008
(1998 Ji Soo's Piano Practice Video)

(1998 Ji Soo's Piano Practice Video)

00:15:32.112 --> 00:15:34.457
When did Grandma leave Oslo?

00:15:35.012 --> 00:15:37.658
She was there from 1997 to 2005.

00:15:39.112 --> 00:15:40.498
Gosh.

00:15:41.723 --> 00:15:43.398
Goodness.

00:15:45.152 --> 00:15:47.392
Grandma says she's in Africa all the time.

00:15:47.392 --> 00:15:48.898
I have tons of work to do.

00:15:49.563 --> 00:15:51.833
The UV rays are no joke at the farm.

00:15:51.833 --> 00:15:54.677
They penetrate just about anything. All the melanin...

00:15:54.762 --> 00:15:57.102
Gosh, my skin used to be the source of my beauty.

00:15:57.102 --> 00:15:58.748
Don't sit on the threshold.

00:15:59.502 --> 00:16:01.618
As if I have any luck left to lose.

00:16:05.642 --> 00:16:07.717
How many years has Soon Ho been working at the farm?

00:16:07.742 --> 00:16:09.288
- 8 years. - 9 years.

00:16:10.112 --> 00:16:12.898
That thing reduced it by a year. It's nine years.

00:16:19.492 --> 00:16:22.692
Uncle, is there any chance I could go to Seoul?

00:16:22.693 --> 00:16:23.862
I want to leave this place.

00:16:23.862 --> 00:16:25.467
You said you didn't want to leave the farm.

00:16:25.663 --> 00:16:27.038
That's all in the past.

00:16:31.132 --> 00:16:33.077
There might be a job for you.

00:16:34.402 --> 00:16:36.418
What? Where?

00:16:36.642 --> 00:16:38.447
What do you mean you bought a recording studio?

00:16:38.813 --> 00:16:40.843
It's the best place to collect voices.

00:16:40.843 --> 00:16:42.788
I want to run tests there on one more person.

00:16:42.813 --> 00:16:45.887
Right, you shouldn't share yours. Don't open what's in your head.

00:16:46.383 --> 00:16:48.228
I won't share this one either.

00:16:49.223 --> 00:16:50.468
Who is it?

00:17:10.842 --> 00:17:13.012
You want me to meet Kim Ji Soo?

00:17:13.012 --> 00:17:14.417
Okay.

00:17:14.943 --> 00:17:18.453
I'll slap her in the face as soon as I meet her.

00:17:18.453 --> 00:17:21.022
Then I'll ask her how it feels to have missed out...

00:17:21.022 --> 00:17:24.193
on the Mark Zuckerberg of Korea and capture the look on her face.

00:17:24.193 --> 00:17:27.468
Soon Ho, that isn't a suitable comparison.

00:17:27.693 --> 00:17:28.963
And I feel like you might actually slap her.

00:17:28.963 --> 00:17:31.468
This is something I've got to do.

00:17:32.393 --> 00:17:33.678
What do I get in return?

00:17:34.332 --> 00:17:37.448
There's someone who suits Ji Soo.

00:17:49.653 --> 00:17:50.728
(For sale or rent)

00:18:03.133 --> 00:18:04.538
Can you step aside?

00:18:07.703 --> 00:18:10.178
- Here. - It's okay.

00:18:12.873 --> 00:18:15.102
Which floor are you visiting?

00:18:15.103 --> 00:18:16.512
The second floor.

00:18:16.512 --> 00:18:18.913
I left a cactus here because it was here before we moved in,

00:18:18.913 --> 00:18:21.113
but they'll probably throw it out when they clear out the studio,

00:18:21.113 --> 00:18:22.282
so I came to get it.

00:18:22.282 --> 00:18:24.327
I see. You worked at the studio.

00:18:24.853 --> 00:18:26.423
Where do you want me to put this?

00:18:26.423 --> 00:18:27.857
Oh, right there.

00:18:28.653 --> 00:18:30.198
What did you do at the studio?

00:18:30.423 --> 00:18:32.228
I was a sound engineer.

00:18:36.022 --> 00:18:38.968
There's someone who suits Ji Soo.

00:18:41.232 --> 00:18:43.832
I love this smell of vacancy.

00:18:43.832 --> 00:18:45.933
There aren't many recording studios just for classical music.

00:18:45.933 --> 00:18:47.842
I don't get why they're closing it down.

00:18:47.842 --> 00:18:50.688
Just for classical music? Why?

00:18:50.943 --> 00:18:53.082
But who said it was to be closed down?

00:18:53.082 --> 00:18:54.557
It can't be.

00:18:54.742 --> 00:18:56.288
We're not closing it down.

00:18:56.312 --> 00:18:59.087
I'm the new manager here.

00:19:00.123 --> 00:19:01.728
No way.

00:19:01.752 --> 00:19:02.857
What?

00:19:03.853 --> 00:19:06.667
I thought it was the end, but it's not.

00:19:07.223 --> 00:19:10.591
Right? Can I keep working here?

00:19:10.592 --> 00:19:11.832
What did you major in college?

00:19:11.832 --> 00:19:13.133
- Data processing. - Gosh.

00:19:13.133 --> 00:19:14.807
But how did you end up working in this field?

00:19:15.133 --> 00:19:17.933
I studied music too, and the engineering field...

00:19:17.933 --> 00:19:19.248
- basically... - What about your age?

00:19:20.242 --> 00:19:21.617
I'm 29.

00:19:21.703 --> 00:19:25.012
This is not good. 29-year-olds are the biggest problem.

00:19:25.012 --> 00:19:27.742
They think they have it the worst in this world.

00:19:27.742 --> 00:19:30.312
They're worse than people who are 39 and 49.

00:19:30.312 --> 00:19:33.481
They complain the most, saying they're so old.

00:19:33.482 --> 00:19:36.728
They think their life is almost over once they turn 30.

00:19:37.393 --> 00:19:39.723
Can I keep working at the studio?

00:19:39.723 --> 00:19:41.097
We'll get to that later.

00:19:42.062 --> 00:19:45.407
Gosh, my back.

00:19:49.502 --> 00:19:51.178
Would you buy some dishes for me?

00:19:54.342 --> 00:19:55.342
(Eunjoo Homestay)

00:19:55.342 --> 00:19:57.018
What's with the dishes?

00:19:57.312 --> 00:20:00.012
She could just buy them herself. Why make someone else do it?

00:20:00.012 --> 00:20:01.311
It feels weird.

00:20:01.312 --> 00:20:02.683
Thank you.

00:20:02.683 --> 00:20:04.113
It's not a big deal.

00:20:04.113 --> 00:20:05.228
What about work?

00:20:06.012 --> 00:20:07.428
Are you staying?

00:20:07.653 --> 00:20:09.222
Thank you for the food.

00:20:09.223 --> 00:20:11.468
She didn't tell me to stop coming.

00:20:13.423 --> 00:20:15.298
- Gosh. - Here.

00:20:20.933 --> 00:20:22.238
Hello?

00:20:22.832 --> 00:20:23.907
Yes.

00:20:25.633 --> 00:20:26.718
Pardon?

00:20:28.403 --> 00:20:29.917
I'll be right out.

00:20:30.812 --> 00:20:32.113
I need to step out for a minute.

00:20:32.113 --> 00:20:33.188
What is it?

00:20:33.282 --> 00:20:35.842
This is unusual. The seller is coming here herself.

00:20:35.842 --> 00:20:37.512
- Who is it? - Kim Ji Soo.

00:20:37.512 --> 00:20:39.028
- Do you know her? - No.

00:20:47.092 --> 00:20:48.193
What's the soup today?

00:20:48.193 --> 00:20:49.807
Bean sprout soup.

00:20:50.032 --> 00:20:51.708
With tofu?

00:20:51.732 --> 00:20:53.238
Whatever.

00:20:54.302 --> 00:20:56.448
- What? - Goodness.

00:21:16.082 --> 00:21:18.167
It was nothing.

00:21:18.923 --> 00:21:23.667
It was just the sight of a stranger climbing up the hill.

00:21:26.562 --> 00:21:28.008
But strangely,

00:21:29.032 --> 00:21:31.877
she burrowed into my heart.

00:21:51.853 --> 00:21:53.498
Ms. Kim Ji Soo?

00:21:56.393 --> 00:21:58.238
I was so grateful...

00:21:59.133 --> 00:22:01.337
and I didn't want them to break.

00:22:29.623 --> 00:22:31.107
Here are the dishes.

00:22:41.643 --> 00:22:42.847
You can keep them.

00:22:45.072 --> 00:22:46.542
- Why? - That's life.

00:22:46.542 --> 00:22:49.518
Things happen that you just can't explain.

00:22:52.613 --> 00:22:54.552
But she exists.

00:22:54.552 --> 00:22:56.322
Kim Ji Soo really does exist.

00:22:56.322 --> 00:22:57.798
Do you know her?

00:22:59.223 --> 00:23:00.822
In my imagination.

00:23:00.822 --> 00:23:04.667
I only imagined her for nine years.

00:23:04.693 --> 00:23:05.907
Why?

00:23:06.032 --> 00:23:08.332
Because I heard about her for nine years.

00:23:08.332 --> 00:23:09.332
And?

00:23:09.332 --> 00:23:10.473
That's all.

00:23:10.473 --> 00:23:13.518
Anyway, I don't care about that dinnerware.

00:23:16.742 --> 00:23:20.913
You don't even care about them, but Ms. Kim packed them with care.

00:23:20.913 --> 00:23:23.913
She took a bus and climbed up a hill with that heavy box.

00:23:23.913 --> 00:23:27.282
She thanked me with all her heart at least 100 times before she left.

00:23:27.282 --> 00:23:29.157
Don't treat the dishes like that.

00:23:29.893 --> 00:23:30.998
This.

00:23:32.153 --> 00:23:33.193
What is it?

00:23:33.193 --> 00:23:35.968
He said you'd know. A recording schedule?

00:23:36.893 --> 00:23:38.562
I don't know these performers.

00:23:38.562 --> 00:23:40.907
What? Will you not record them if you don't know them?

00:23:41.302 --> 00:23:42.562
- I should. - You have a lot of work to do.

00:23:42.562 --> 00:23:43.647
I do.

00:23:44.802 --> 00:23:46.048
I'll work hard.

00:24:03.853 --> 00:24:05.968
Hi there.

00:24:12.463 --> 00:24:15.607
Hi there. You too. Hi.

00:24:20.373 --> 00:24:21.448
Hi.

00:24:24.643 --> 00:24:27.458
- Hello. - Who would've known?

00:24:27.542 --> 00:24:29.857
I didn't think we'd get to record here again.

00:24:30.613 --> 00:24:31.988
Right?

00:24:43.732 --> 00:24:45.738
- Lower the cello balance. - Okay.

00:25:34.913 --> 00:25:37.127
What happened here?

00:25:43.492 --> 00:25:44.798
Oh my gosh. What happened here?

00:26:09.842 --> 00:26:12.758
Again?

00:26:22.292 --> 00:26:23.667
Dear Before Dawn.

00:26:24.163 --> 00:26:26.592
Please clean before you leave.

00:26:26.592 --> 00:26:27.938
(Dear Before Dawn. Please clean before you leave.)

00:26:55.723 --> 00:26:58.292
Nightlike afternoon.

00:26:58.292 --> 00:27:00.938
(Nightlike afternoon)

00:27:09.002 --> 00:27:10.317
You're incredible.

00:27:11.512 --> 00:27:12.617
Seriously.

00:27:28.822 --> 00:27:31.708
Excuse me. Who are you? What are you doing in there?

00:27:32.433 --> 00:27:33.678
Did the sun rise already?

00:27:47.713 --> 00:27:49.117
What's his deal?

00:27:54.282 --> 00:27:55.798
Look at the spacing.

00:27:56.453 --> 00:27:58.228
He must be Before Dawn.

00:28:09.232 --> 00:28:11.407
- What is this? - Excuse me.

00:28:13.643 --> 00:28:14.817
That's right.

00:28:16.772 --> 00:28:18.617
I always mean to clean up but forget.

00:28:19.012 --> 00:28:20.218
I'll do it.

00:28:21.042 --> 00:28:22.958
Don't you rent it only until before dawn?

00:28:23.512 --> 00:28:25.057
Until 4am.

00:28:25.453 --> 00:28:26.758
Do you know what time it is?

00:28:28.082 --> 00:28:29.528
I'm so busy.

00:28:30.752 --> 00:28:32.522
I'm here at 8:30 on the dot,

00:28:32.522 --> 00:28:35.123
so please clean up before then. Okay?

00:28:35.123 --> 00:28:36.367
8:30.

00:28:53.312 --> 00:28:55.718
Keep the door open so more people can hear it.

00:29:29.413 --> 00:29:30.528
Seo Woo!

00:29:33.923 --> 00:29:35.097
You found it.

00:29:36.082 --> 00:29:37.698
Because of the recital.

00:29:38.353 --> 00:29:39.827
- Let me. - It's okay.

00:29:42.623 --> 00:29:45.238
My grandmother groomed these trees for over 30 years.

00:29:45.732 --> 00:29:48.863
She did them all herself? That's amazing.

00:29:48.863 --> 00:29:51.948
She's devoted to anything that is alive.

00:29:52.873 --> 00:29:54.478
How many people are coming?

00:29:54.802 --> 00:29:56.042
The living room always fills up.

00:29:56.042 --> 00:29:57.748
Sometimes, some people have to sit in the yard.

00:29:58.413 --> 00:30:00.617
That's bigger than I expected.

00:30:02.213 --> 00:30:04.087
It's like a family function.

00:30:04.752 --> 00:30:06.758
When my grandmother was a diplomat,

00:30:07.082 --> 00:30:09.923
she used to sponsor Korean kids who were musically talented...

00:30:09.923 --> 00:30:12.627
and hold recitals for them. She must have liked it.

00:30:14.363 --> 00:30:16.667
Your grandmother did a lot of good things.

00:30:17.363 --> 00:30:18.438
That's right.

00:30:18.663 --> 00:30:22.107
If she had saved all that money, I'd own a building now.

00:30:24.133 --> 00:30:27.377
She insists they're all siblings and family,

00:30:27.542 --> 00:30:28.847
but it's not the same.

00:30:29.542 --> 00:30:31.742
I consider only one uncle my family,

00:30:31.742 --> 00:30:33.788
and the rest are strangers to me.

00:30:34.113 --> 00:30:36.087
Why only him?

00:30:36.713 --> 00:30:39.028
Because he's good looking and successful.

00:30:42.353 --> 00:30:44.728
I can't believe you fell for that. I'm kidding.

00:30:44.992 --> 00:30:48.268
I have a special history with my uncle.

00:30:51.693 --> 00:30:54.438
I've never met someone who sponsors people in person.

00:30:54.762 --> 00:30:56.238
She's so amazing.

00:30:56.302 --> 00:30:59.847
What do you think? Do you trust me more now?

00:31:01.302 --> 00:31:02.817
So I was thinking...

00:31:06.242 --> 00:31:08.518
Record Kim Ji Soo saying a few things.

00:31:08.913 --> 00:31:11.657
- But why? - How would I know?

00:31:11.913 --> 00:31:13.958
I don't even know what this does.

00:31:15.423 --> 00:31:16.683
If you record someone with this,

00:31:16.683 --> 00:31:18.822
it'll sound like the person is right next to you.

00:31:18.822 --> 00:31:19.991
That's right.

00:31:19.992 --> 00:31:23.137
The person must want to hear her voice like she was there.

00:31:23.262 --> 00:31:24.663
Who? Why?

00:31:24.663 --> 00:31:26.433
I need to know that before I do it.

00:31:26.433 --> 00:31:28.837
Well... Someone...

00:31:29.903 --> 00:31:31.948
- misses Kim Ji Soo. - Who?

00:31:32.673 --> 00:31:34.178
Let's stop there.

00:31:36.072 --> 00:31:38.742
I'm not close enough with her to record her voice.

00:31:38.742 --> 00:31:40.218
Do you have to be?

00:31:40.782 --> 00:31:43.683
You can buy some more dishes. Buy them in person.

00:31:43.683 --> 00:31:46.052
And chat a little bit, and go,

00:31:46.052 --> 00:31:49.458
"Oh my. You have a great voice." And record it.

00:31:49.623 --> 00:31:52.228
Do you record people's voices if they're nice?

00:31:52.592 --> 00:31:54.723
It's not like I'm getting digits.

00:31:54.723 --> 00:31:57.508
"I like you. May I get your voice?" Should I say that?

00:31:59.193 --> 00:32:00.538
Just do it.

00:33:32.592 --> 00:33:34.423
A turntable?

00:33:34.423 --> 00:33:36.438
That's super old.

00:33:37.562 --> 00:33:39.137
I wonder if it works.

00:34:03.083 --> 00:34:06.098
What is your relationship with Kim Ji Soo?

00:34:06.293 --> 00:34:07.897
We're kids who are like islands.

00:34:10.163 --> 00:34:11.361
Who?

00:34:11.362 --> 00:34:14.008
You asked about Kim Ji Soo and me.

00:34:18.003 --> 00:34:20.147
How long have you known each other?

00:34:32.148 --> 00:34:37.148

"Ha Won Meets Seo Woo"
-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-

00:34:50.833 --> 00:34:54.402
The only two Korean kids in Norway...

00:34:54.402 --> 00:34:55.718
meet when they're young.

00:34:55.973 --> 00:34:57.718
They go to middle school,

00:34:58.442 --> 00:35:00.017
then they go to high school.

00:36:02.103 --> 00:36:04.048
They meet as soon as the sun rises,

00:36:04.072 --> 00:36:05.888
and part once the sun sets.

00:36:07.442 --> 00:36:10.587
They spend 24 hours together on polar days.

00:36:13.882 --> 00:36:15.828
They dreaded the sun setting more than anything.

00:36:19.893 --> 00:36:22.138

00:36:22.322 --> 00:36:24.792

- Go. - Gyo.

00:36:26.992 --> 00:36:29.107
- Goo. - Gyoo.

Cosmos laid its hand on me

It was very light

00:36:46.453 --> 00:36:49.928
The language only they shared became their secret...

00:36:50.723 --> 00:36:52.368
and unified the kids who were like islands.

00:37:01.063 --> 00:37:02.461
Who are you?

00:37:02.462 --> 00:37:04.278
Introduce yourself first.

00:37:04.333 --> 00:37:06.278
Then I'll explain the relationship.

00:37:11.413 --> 00:37:12.988
Why are you hiding...

00:37:14.143 --> 00:37:16.782
What's with the voice? Why do you need it?

00:37:16.782 --> 00:37:19.658
Do you not plan to meet Ji Soo?

00:37:25.523 --> 00:37:26.523
How did it go?

00:37:26.523 --> 00:37:27.822
I'm not sure.

00:37:27.822 --> 00:37:30.738
It looks like she'll do it, but at the same time, not.

00:37:30.992 --> 00:37:33.563
Why did you make me do something like this?

00:37:33.563 --> 00:37:35.638
Why do you need her stupid voice?

00:37:37.902 --> 00:37:39.647
A video is enough.

00:37:40.373 --> 00:37:41.742
I only want...

00:37:41.742 --> 00:37:43.278
I only want...

00:37:43.503 --> 00:37:45.317
a small piece of her.

00:37:46.773 --> 00:37:50.118
Where are you right now?

00:37:52.953 --> 00:37:54.227
Look for me.

00:38:35.893 --> 00:38:39.437
I only want a small piece of her.

00:38:57.382 --> 00:38:58.687
Hello.

00:38:59.253 --> 00:39:00.328
Hello.

00:39:01.483 --> 00:39:02.997
Are you done?

00:39:03.382 --> 00:39:06.767
No. I can't see very well. The light won't turn on.

00:39:16.462 --> 00:39:18.302
It usually works if you hit it a few times.

00:39:18.302 --> 00:39:20.678
I'll tell the manager later when she comes.

00:39:37.183 --> 00:39:38.298
Darn it.

00:39:48.203 --> 00:39:49.278
Goodness.

00:39:50.433 --> 00:39:52.247
I can't see at all in the dark.

00:39:52.703 --> 00:39:55.477
I can't find my way in the movie theater either.

00:39:55.703 --> 00:39:57.587
- Can you see? - Yes.

00:39:58.172 --> 00:39:59.647
I'm used to the dark.

00:40:04.782 --> 00:40:07.698
- This way. - I can see that.

00:40:10.322 --> 00:40:11.567
Look for me.

00:40:17.893 --> 00:40:19.337
Excuse me.

00:40:19.793 --> 00:40:22.063
What time did you come today?

00:40:22.063 --> 00:40:24.078
I came early because I heard it was empty.

00:40:24.203 --> 00:40:25.678
Around 7pm?

00:40:25.703 --> 00:40:28.817
So you were here all night.

00:40:28.973 --> 00:40:30.218
That's right.

00:40:32.373 --> 00:40:34.888
I thought I heard a similar voice.

00:40:35.983 --> 00:40:38.488
He was hiding, so I couldn't see his face.

00:40:40.382 --> 00:40:41.623
- He was hiding? - Yes.

00:40:41.623 --> 00:40:43.523
At the manager's farm.

00:40:43.523 --> 00:40:45.552
She asked me to record something.

00:40:45.552 --> 00:40:48.537
It was in some room with an old turntable.

00:40:48.592 --> 00:40:51.992
There was nowhere for a person to hide, but he was hiding.

00:40:51.992 --> 00:40:54.308
When did Grandma leave Oslo?

00:40:54.362 --> 00:40:56.977
She was there from 1997 to 2005.

00:40:57.802 --> 00:40:59.508
What did he say?

00:41:00.003 --> 00:41:02.548
To look for him. He said to look for him.

00:41:03.473 --> 00:41:05.313
What did you say that he said to look for him?

00:41:05.313 --> 00:41:07.712
I asked him where he was, and he said to look for him.

00:41:07.712 --> 00:41:09.183
Why did you ask where he was?

00:41:09.183 --> 00:41:12.158
Because he was hiding while talking to me, that's why.

00:41:14.683 --> 00:41:15.683
That's odd.

00:41:15.683 --> 00:41:17.627
It's very odd.

00:41:17.992 --> 00:41:20.192
My life is filled with odd things these days.

00:41:20.192 --> 00:41:22.723
People I didn't know suddenly appear...

00:41:22.723 --> 00:41:24.667
and make odd requests.

00:41:28.333 --> 00:41:30.008
I'm sorry. You were working.

00:41:30.563 --> 00:41:32.548
Time is money here.

00:41:33.703 --> 00:41:34.977
Work hard.

00:41:41.043 --> 00:41:43.287
Excuse me. Do you...

00:41:45.552 --> 00:41:48.151
understand wanting a recording of someone's voice...

00:41:48.152 --> 00:41:49.298
because you miss them?

00:41:51.192 --> 00:41:53.267
It's not very conventional,

00:41:53.293 --> 00:41:55.298
but I understand.

00:41:57.793 --> 00:42:00.592
Whether you cherish a photograph or a voice recording,

00:42:00.592 --> 00:42:02.408
I think it's the same.

00:42:08.203 --> 00:42:09.618
Goodnight.

00:42:22.953 --> 00:42:25.397
- I think it's okay. - Don't do it.

00:42:25.523 --> 00:42:26.798
She's weird.

00:42:27.592 --> 00:42:30.468
Why would a woman sell dinnerware?

00:42:30.723 --> 00:42:32.592
- Record it. - No.

00:42:32.592 --> 00:42:34.163
It's all a ploy.

00:42:34.163 --> 00:42:36.408
Seo Woo is the idiot for getting caught in the middle.

00:42:37.503 --> 00:42:39.008
Tell her who you really are.

00:42:39.103 --> 00:42:41.902
Who is that? A classmate in our department...

00:42:41.902 --> 00:42:42.973
You brat!

00:42:42.973 --> 00:42:44.543
I said to put the dishes in the sink.

00:42:44.543 --> 00:42:47.548
I finished doing the dishes already. Darn it.

00:42:49.242 --> 00:42:51.988
Do I record the voice or not?

00:42:55.822 --> 00:42:59.667
A piece, a piece

00:42:59.793 --> 00:43:01.738
A piece, a piece

00:43:10.503 --> 00:43:13.808
Open the window when the sunlight hits, okay?

00:43:14.003 --> 00:43:16.178
Don't leave the curtain down.

00:43:16.672 --> 00:43:18.488
It rained all day there too, right?

00:43:18.773 --> 00:43:20.942
The mill down the hill got flooded.

00:43:20.942 --> 00:43:24.058
The boiler room and the field are a real mess.

00:43:24.453 --> 00:43:27.897
We're fine only because we're high up.

00:43:28.882 --> 00:43:32.393
Seo Woo. A bunch of young kids came today,

00:43:32.393 --> 00:43:36.368
taking pictures and traveling. It looked nice.

00:43:37.322 --> 00:43:38.937
You should date too.

00:43:39.233 --> 00:43:41.008
You should date while you're young.

00:43:42.632 --> 00:43:44.848
I said okay.

00:43:51.172 --> 00:43:54.247
Open the window when the sunlight hits, okay?

00:43:54.643 --> 00:43:56.618
Don't leave the curtain down.

00:43:57.382 --> 00:43:58.928
It rained all day there too, right?

00:43:59.583 --> 00:44:01.598
The mill down the hill got flooded.

00:44:01.723 --> 00:44:04.627
The boiler room and the field are a real mess.

00:44:05.152 --> 00:44:07.698
We're fine only because we're high up.

00:44:09.063 --> 00:44:12.433
Seo Woo. A bunch of young kids came today,

00:44:12.433 --> 00:44:16.377
taking pictures and traveling. It looked nice.

00:44:19.473 --> 00:44:22.718
I programmed it so that no one but you and I can talk to it.

00:44:23.473 --> 00:44:25.787
It was either a simple error or you did it wrong.

00:44:26.712 --> 00:44:29.413
Why are you so careless?

00:44:29.413 --> 00:44:30.658
You're just asking for it.

00:44:31.712 --> 00:44:33.052
I told you,

00:44:33.052 --> 00:44:35.758
we can't use it for therapy if you can't properly limit access.

00:44:39.092 --> 00:44:41.437
I reprogrammed it. It should be okay now.

00:44:42.362 --> 00:44:45.368
Use it. Try to get through if you can.

00:44:45.632 --> 00:44:47.877
Are you saying I can get through or not?

00:44:48.563 --> 00:44:49.707
Darn it.

00:45:18.163 --> 00:45:19.592
- Oh, my. - Send me the address...

00:45:19.592 --> 00:45:21.163
where I should receive the package. I'll do it.

00:45:21.163 --> 00:45:23.037
Why are you making it complicated?

00:45:23.402 --> 00:45:24.948
You should just receive it where you normally do.

00:45:37.282 --> 00:45:39.587
Hey. Send me an address in Seoul.

00:45:39.683 --> 00:45:41.582
Seo Woo says she'll do it.

00:45:41.583 --> 00:45:42.758
(77-30 Wokin 4-gil)

00:45:55.632 --> 00:45:57.037
What are you looking at?

00:45:57.833 --> 00:45:59.178
The green.

00:46:00.273 --> 00:46:02.417
Looking at something green soothes me.

00:46:04.172 --> 00:46:06.112
I'll block your view if I sit here.

00:46:06.112 --> 00:46:08.417
- Should I sit to the side? - It's okay.

00:46:11.853 --> 00:46:13.112
Do you work nearby?

00:46:13.112 --> 00:46:15.127
Yes, a few stop away.

00:46:16.123 --> 00:46:18.152
I asked to meet to buy some more pieces.

00:46:18.152 --> 00:46:19.528
Do you like the dishes?

00:46:20.092 --> 00:46:22.098
It looks great with traditional Korean food too.

00:46:26.462 --> 00:46:28.003
Should I send it to the same address?

00:46:28.003 --> 00:46:31.948
No, no. Not there. Don't bring it yourself this time. It's heavy.

00:46:32.733 --> 00:46:34.607
What's the address again?

00:46:34.942 --> 00:46:37.477
What was it? It's for a friend.

00:46:38.273 --> 00:46:39.618
I'll jot it down.

00:46:45.282 --> 00:46:46.357
(Prescription)

00:46:55.393 --> 00:46:58.067
(Prescription, Name: Kim Ji Soo)

00:47:00.333 --> 00:47:01.837
It's my prescription.

00:47:02.032 --> 00:47:04.138
I know. I know the medicine too.

00:47:05.802 --> 00:47:08.802
I went to see a psychiatrist before too. Just once.

00:47:08.802 --> 00:47:11.687
It's as common as the common cold these days.

00:47:17.512 --> 00:47:18.888
Where should I write it?

00:47:20.782 --> 00:47:22.658
I'll text it to you.

00:47:24.523 --> 00:47:27.997
That's right. That's so simple. What's wrong with me?

00:47:30.422 --> 00:47:34.437
When I feel frustrated, I go to the highest point in town.

00:47:37.163 --> 00:47:38.873
It's therapeutic to look down.

00:47:38.873 --> 00:47:41.973
They say when astronauts look down on Earth from space,

00:47:41.973 --> 00:47:43.742
they get a whole new outlook on life.

00:47:43.742 --> 00:47:45.388
All their worries seem trivial.

00:47:52.212 --> 00:47:53.888
That's why I sell my dinnerware.

00:47:54.882 --> 00:47:56.158
After my session,

00:47:56.683 --> 00:47:58.397
I felt like I should do something.

00:47:58.453 --> 00:48:00.897
So I posted pictures of my dinnerware that I cherish.

00:48:01.253 --> 00:48:02.623
When I delivered it to you,

00:48:02.623 --> 00:48:04.698
it was the first time I left home in three months.

00:48:08.132 --> 00:48:09.207
Excuse me.

00:48:17.373 --> 00:48:18.442
What?

00:48:18.442 --> 00:48:21.317
You know, like a-e-i-o-u.

00:48:21.612 --> 00:48:24.753
Consonants, vowels, sentences.

00:48:24.753 --> 00:48:27.457
Which sentences? You're not making any sense.

00:48:27.552 --> 00:48:28.897
I'll email you.

00:48:29.052 --> 00:48:30.828
I wouldn't know even if I saw it.

00:48:31.422 --> 00:48:34.997
Check your email. That will explain everything.

00:48:35.063 --> 00:48:36.868
Refer to that when you record her voice.

00:48:39.793 --> 00:48:40.937
What was that?

00:50:13.552 --> 00:50:14.667
Let's go.

00:51:26.663 --> 00:51:29.178
Won, look at the ceiling.

00:51:31.503 --> 00:51:32.747
It's soothing.

00:51:38.512 --> 00:51:39.647
Come in.

00:51:46.583 --> 00:51:48.127
Stand in front of the mic.

00:51:49.183 --> 00:51:50.258
Me?

00:51:53.123 --> 00:51:54.897
Say anything you want.

00:51:56.762 --> 00:51:59.032
- And? - I'll record it.

00:51:59.032 --> 00:52:02.337
If there's someone who misses you, I'll sell it at a high price.

00:52:03.663 --> 00:52:05.278
There's no one like that.

00:52:07.273 --> 00:52:10.917
Don't you think everyone has at least one person who misses them?

00:52:13.973 --> 00:52:16.888
- I don't know. - Don't think too much about it.

00:52:17.382 --> 00:52:19.388
You don't have to do it if you don't want to.

00:52:24.152 --> 00:52:25.828
What should I do?

00:52:27.753 --> 00:52:31.707
First, let's begin with the basics. Ga, na, da, ra, and so on.

00:52:32.333 --> 00:52:34.267
You can start once I give you the signal.

00:52:42.103 --> 00:52:43.218
Ga.

00:52:47.242 --> 00:52:48.357
Gya.

00:52:48.942 --> 00:52:50.017
- Geo. - Geo.

00:52:50.742 --> 00:52:51.857
- Gyeo. - Gyeo.

00:52:53.012 --> 00:52:54.127
- Go. - Go.

00:52:54.983 --> 00:52:56.058
- Gyo. - Gyo.

00:52:57.253 --> 00:52:58.428
- Goo. - Goo.

00:52:58.922 --> 00:53:00.828
- Gyoo. - Gyoo.

00:53:03.123 --> 00:53:05.337
Isn't it ga, na, da, ra?

00:53:07.733 --> 00:53:09.977
Let's do something longer this time.

00:53:10.203 --> 00:53:12.207
I'll give you a sentence. Hold on.

00:53:15.572 --> 00:53:16.747
A single

00:53:17.603 --> 00:53:18.817
Leaf

00:53:20.813 --> 00:53:23.058
Lands on the shoulder

00:53:23.942 --> 00:53:26.328
Without making

00:53:28.112 --> 00:53:30.598
A sound

00:53:34.523 --> 00:53:36.468
Cosmos laid

00:53:37.123 --> 00:53:39.037
Its hand on me

00:53:41.862 --> 00:53:43.107
It was

00:53:45.032 --> 00:53:46.308
Very light

00:53:46.603 --> 00:53:48.008
It was

00:53:48.503 --> 00:53:50.078
Very light

00:54:04.382 --> 00:54:07.698
You know that sentence earlier? You had it memorized.

00:54:08.223 --> 00:54:12.368
I learned Korean in Norway using Korean poetry and novels.

00:54:15.663 --> 00:54:17.902
I'll ship over the bowl as soon as I get home.

00:54:17.902 --> 00:54:19.808
The address.

00:54:23.342 --> 00:54:25.687
It's near the cafe.

00:54:27.512 --> 00:54:30.658
I haven't been to her place yet.

00:54:31.643 --> 00:54:34.357
(Kim Ji Soo)

00:54:35.882 --> 00:54:37.258
I sent it.

00:54:40.893 --> 00:54:42.767
Okay. Goodbye.

00:54:48.632 --> 00:54:52.747
(Han Seo Woo, 47-341 Wokin-dong, Jongro-gu)

00:55:17.192 --> 00:55:18.667
It's Ha Won, isn't it?

00:55:20.492 --> 00:55:23.908
Did Ha Won put you up to this? All of it?

00:55:27.883 --> 00:55:29.129
It's Ha Won, isn't it?

00:55:31.054 --> 00:55:34.439
Did Ha Won put you up to this? All of it?

00:55:35.594 --> 00:55:37.063
I don't know who that is.

00:55:37.063 --> 00:55:38.609
That address you sent me...

00:55:38.903 --> 00:55:41.138
Only Ha Won and I know that address.

00:55:54.483 --> 00:55:56.014
I don't know.

00:55:56.014 --> 00:55:57.888
What about this address?

00:55:58.853 --> 00:56:00.324
Who lives here?

00:56:00.324 --> 00:56:02.023
My supervisor.

00:56:02.023 --> 00:56:04.394
What is your supervisor's name?

00:56:04.394 --> 00:56:06.199
Moon Soon Ho.

00:56:07.864 --> 00:56:09.368
Then it's not him.

00:56:10.264 --> 00:56:12.664
True. It would make no sense.

00:56:12.664 --> 00:56:14.779
I was just overly sensitive.

00:56:15.133 --> 00:56:16.848
He'd never do that.

00:56:17.374 --> 00:56:19.518
Are you all right?

00:56:48.874 --> 00:56:49.978
Seo Woo.

00:56:50.934 --> 00:56:52.103
Who was that just now?

00:56:52.103 --> 00:56:53.919
Oh, my heart.

00:56:54.474 --> 00:56:56.173
I can't handle this.

00:56:56.173 --> 00:56:58.788
I've used up all my lies for my entire life today.

00:56:59.014 --> 00:57:01.689
Hey. Who was that?

00:57:01.914 --> 00:57:03.388
Kim Ji Soo.

00:57:06.383 --> 00:57:09.053
What? Are you insane?

00:57:09.054 --> 00:57:10.494
Why did you bring her here?

00:57:10.494 --> 00:57:12.569
What about Ha Won?

00:57:13.193 --> 00:57:17.293
Ha Won just flat out told her, "It's me, Ha Won."

00:57:17.293 --> 00:57:21.078
When she saw the address, she asked, "Ha Won put you up to this, right?"

00:57:21.463 --> 00:57:23.173
She said it's an address only the two of them know.

00:57:23.173 --> 00:57:24.379
Oh, no.

00:57:24.574 --> 00:57:28.374
A sentence that she memorizes, and an address that she knows.

00:57:28.374 --> 00:57:31.848
He sent her all these messages saying, "Look for me."

00:57:33.483 --> 00:57:36.388
He should show his face right about now.

00:57:37.383 --> 00:57:38.828
Why isn't he coming?

00:57:40.054 --> 00:57:42.793
Why did you bring her here?

00:57:42.793 --> 00:57:44.792
Who's Ha Won?

00:57:44.793 --> 00:57:45.793
Why?

00:57:45.793 --> 00:57:47.193
He said to look for him.

00:57:47.193 --> 00:57:49.538
He did? To you?

00:57:50.563 --> 00:57:52.963
He has lost his mind.

00:57:52.963 --> 00:57:54.664
That's why you brought Ji Soo here.

00:57:54.664 --> 00:57:57.673
I just can't stand it.

00:57:57.673 --> 00:57:59.618
You idiot.

00:58:02.273 --> 00:58:03.974
I won't do anything for you anymore.

00:58:03.974 --> 00:58:06.259
Don't ask me to do anything anymore.

00:58:07.284 --> 00:58:10.728
A single leaf

00:58:12.983 --> 00:58:15.328
Lands on the shoulder

00:58:16.423 --> 00:58:17.494
Without

00:58:17.494 --> 00:58:19.839
I'm done once I send this.

00:58:20.793 --> 00:58:22.408
making a sound

00:58:23.364 --> 00:58:24.994
Cosmos

00:58:24.994 --> 00:58:26.164
Her tone got lower.

00:58:26.164 --> 00:58:27.864
- Laid its hand on me - Sorry?

00:58:27.864 --> 00:58:30.178
190Hz, no boom.

00:58:30.633 --> 00:58:32.578
About 55 decibels.

00:58:32.744 --> 00:58:34.018
It was

00:58:34.773 --> 00:58:36.388
Very light

00:58:36.574 --> 00:58:37.744
Her tone sounds depressed.

00:58:37.744 --> 00:58:39.089
You're right.

00:58:44.014 --> 00:58:46.828
Just answer me using common sense.

00:58:49.153 --> 00:58:53.199
This recording studio has something to do with a guy named Ha Won.

00:58:53.494 --> 00:58:55.764
From hiring me, down to every little detail.

00:58:55.764 --> 00:58:58.138
I don't know how long he has been planning it,

00:58:58.394 --> 00:59:00.879
but he does everything while hiding.

00:59:01.003 --> 00:59:02.879
He is very thorough.

00:59:03.534 --> 00:59:06.374
Everything points toward the girl, Kim Ji Soo.

00:59:06.374 --> 00:59:07.943
He misses her a lot.

00:59:07.943 --> 00:59:09.943
But she is depressed.

00:59:09.943 --> 00:59:11.319
That's why...

00:59:14.383 --> 00:59:16.859
What if I make the two of them...

00:59:17.554 --> 00:59:19.899
meet? What do you think?

00:59:22.423 --> 00:59:25.793
What am I doing? Am I just being a busybody?

00:59:25.793 --> 00:59:26.939
Right?

00:59:27.423 --> 00:59:29.638
I don't usually get involved in other people's matters.

00:59:29.793 --> 00:59:32.138
Why do you want to do that for them?

00:59:36.374 --> 00:59:39.149
You don't remember everyone's first impression, do you?

00:59:39.474 --> 00:59:40.618
Probably not.

00:59:41.673 --> 00:59:44.419
Me neither. I don't remember them all.

00:59:44.974 --> 00:59:48.319
But there are some people whom you first meet in passing,

00:59:48.483 --> 00:59:51.328
but you remember how that person opened the door and walked in,

00:59:51.583 --> 00:59:54.759
whether they were sitting or standing,

00:59:54.954 --> 00:59:57.328
or how you started talking to each other.

00:59:57.894 --> 01:00:01.368
Time can't erase the moment you first met them.

01:00:03.164 --> 01:00:06.779
How they walked up the hill.

01:00:09.833 --> 01:00:12.773
People like that tend to remain in my life for a long time.

01:00:12.773 --> 01:00:16.018
Ji Soo is like that. I want to help her.

01:00:28.023 --> 01:00:30.569
Do you always stare at people blatantly like that?

01:00:31.923 --> 01:00:33.299
Did I do that?

01:00:33.594 --> 01:00:35.393
Your reason was amusing.

01:00:35.394 --> 01:00:36.594
It's persuasive.

01:00:36.594 --> 01:00:37.868
Is it convincing?

01:00:39.204 --> 01:00:41.708
When you feel for someone...

01:00:43.534 --> 01:00:45.949
When you feel for them for no apparent reason,

01:00:46.574 --> 01:00:50.043
it's because of layers of afterimages gathered over time.

01:00:50.043 --> 01:00:53.058
I never thought about first impressions that you mention.

01:01:00.224 --> 01:01:02.399
I clearly remember when I first saw you.

01:01:10.133 --> 01:01:11.268
Me too.

01:01:11.563 --> 01:01:13.164
I saw you here.

01:01:13.164 --> 01:01:15.908
You were in there, and I was out here.

01:01:29.753 --> 01:01:31.784
See? You don't remember.

01:01:31.784 --> 01:01:33.759
I guess I'm just passing by.

01:01:36.753 --> 01:01:39.768
Should I have the two of them meet?

01:01:42.333 --> 01:01:45.069
What if meeting only makes them hurt more?

01:01:45.633 --> 01:01:47.408
Then that's their fate.

01:02:37.284 --> 01:02:40.399
Open the window when the sunlight hits, okay?

01:02:40.824 --> 01:02:42.768
Don't leave the curtain down.

01:02:43.494 --> 01:02:45.098
It rained all day there too, right?

01:02:45.664 --> 01:02:47.864
The mill down the hill got flooded.

01:02:47.864 --> 01:02:50.708
The boiler room and the field are a real mess.

01:02:57.733 --> 01:03:00.819
I don't talk to people who don't know music.

01:03:01.173 --> 01:03:03.319
Sir. That's not it.

01:03:03.474 --> 01:03:06.018
Yes. She's here. The musician.

01:03:06.184 --> 01:03:08.184
Since when was Seo Woo a musician?

01:03:08.184 --> 01:03:10.614
Hello. Let me explain.

01:03:10.614 --> 01:03:12.399
I don't care for your reasons.

01:03:12.824 --> 01:03:15.498
You could've just texted that the recording was canceled.

01:03:15.954 --> 01:03:17.069
Am I wrong?

01:03:20.463 --> 01:03:23.233
Our studio closed down, so we thought...

01:03:23.233 --> 01:03:25.494
everything previously scheduled had been canceled.

01:03:25.494 --> 01:03:26.603
I've heard enough.

01:03:26.603 --> 01:03:28.434
Something else got scheduled in between.

01:03:28.434 --> 01:03:30.978
I see. So he's doing that, but not this?

01:03:31.034 --> 01:03:33.518
I'll call Mr. Choi right away.

01:03:33.603 --> 01:03:36.219
Sir, please.

01:03:38.614 --> 01:03:39.859
Finish it in one take.

01:03:40.213 --> 01:03:42.114
You want me to do it?

01:03:42.114 --> 01:03:44.089
Talk to Jin Moo about the mixing.

01:03:44.353 --> 01:03:46.928
- Let's just call it a day... - I'll do it.

01:03:48.653 --> 01:03:51.153
I'll discuss the mixing with Mr. Choi,

01:03:51.153 --> 01:03:53.169
- and if he says it's bad... - Delete it.

01:03:53.764 --> 01:03:55.138
And we won't do a new take.

01:04:03.603 --> 01:04:05.149
It's so degrading.

01:04:06.874 --> 01:04:08.748
It's more degrading to come back.

01:05:23.213 --> 01:05:24.328
Hello.

01:05:37.864 --> 01:05:39.538
What are you doing?

01:05:42.003 --> 01:05:43.078
What?

01:05:44.974 --> 01:05:46.848
I'm on my way to see Kim Ji Soo.

01:05:47.603 --> 01:05:48.978
You said you wouldn't do anything.

01:05:49.244 --> 01:05:51.848
Tell Ha Won he has to come.

01:05:53.083 --> 01:05:55.319
Hey! Are you okay?

01:05:57.213 --> 01:05:58.388
What's with her?

01:05:58.983 --> 01:06:01.699
Chief. It's Hoon.

01:06:06.193 --> 01:06:08.394
- Hey. - Soon Ho said to call her.

01:06:08.394 --> 01:06:10.408
She knows you don't answer your phone during this time.

01:06:10.894 --> 01:06:13.038
It must be urgent if she called me.

01:06:39.264 --> 01:06:41.098
(Han Seo Woo)

01:06:50.233 --> 01:06:51.348
Hello.

01:06:52.204 --> 01:06:53.403
(Han Seo Woo)

01:06:53.403 --> 01:06:54.618
Are you with someone?

01:06:54.874 --> 01:06:56.518
I don't think she's here yet.

01:06:57.574 --> 01:06:59.418
Would you like to order first?

01:07:01.313 --> 01:07:02.418
Sure.

01:07:14.324 --> 01:07:15.439
Ji Soo.

01:07:16.193 --> 01:07:18.369
- Ji Soo? - Yes, Seo Woo.

01:07:20.704 --> 01:07:22.808
I'm running a little late.

01:07:23.973 --> 01:07:25.279
Where are you?

01:07:25.903 --> 01:07:27.579
I think I saw someone.

01:07:28.504 --> 01:07:30.218
I can't see him.

01:07:34.313 --> 01:07:36.428
Is it someone you really can't see?

01:07:38.853 --> 01:07:40.058
It's Ha Won, isn't it?

01:07:42.853 --> 01:07:44.869
- You can't see him? - No, never.

01:07:50.063 --> 01:07:51.209
Don't look back.

01:08:06.244 --> 01:08:07.359
Run.

01:08:32.504 --> 01:08:34.218
It was nothing.

01:08:36.813 --> 01:08:38.888
I haven't met him before,

01:08:41.784 --> 01:08:43.159
but he burrowed...

01:08:44.483 --> 01:08:45.659
into my heart.

01:09:26.824 --> 01:09:29.193
(A Piece of Your Mind)

01:09:29.193 --> 01:09:32.369
I shouldn't have done anything.

01:09:32.704 --> 01:09:35.433
Is there something you want to ask that guy Ha Won?

01:09:35.433 --> 01:09:37.209
I want to see him from afar.

01:09:38.303 --> 01:09:39.978
I won't run away next time.

01:09:40.403 --> 01:09:41.619
Next time? When?

01:09:42.204 --> 01:09:43.789
If I can apologize...

01:09:43.874 --> 01:09:45.319
I told you, it's nothing to apologize for.

01:09:45.473 --> 01:09:47.388
I told you over and over that it's too hard for me.

01:09:48.313 --> 01:09:51.359
How do you think they endured 10 years?

01:09:51.714 --> 01:09:53.959
Let's go tomorrow.
