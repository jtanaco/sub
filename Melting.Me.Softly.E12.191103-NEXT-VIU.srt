(in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:23,484 --> 00:00:25,330
I've been looking for him everywhere.

4
00:00:26,115 --> 00:00:27,859
I can't believe this is where he was all along.

5
00:00:30,994 --> 00:00:32,430
Where did you take him?

6
00:00:34,232 --> 00:00:37,547
Bring him here right now if you do not wish to die!

7
00:00:57,514 --> 00:00:58,830
Professor Hwang, where are you?

8
00:00:58,914 --> 00:01:01,355
I think those two will face a variation in them soon.

9
00:01:01,355 --> 00:01:03,470
You have to come quickly. Professor Hwang?

10
00:01:04,924 --> 00:01:06,370
You have my trust.

11
00:01:07,124 --> 00:01:09,199
M, 3, 4.

12
00:01:14,234 --> 00:01:15,710
(Professor Jo Gi Bum)

13
00:01:17,504 --> 00:01:18,609
Tell me.

14
00:01:18,775 --> 00:01:20,650
Where did you hide the cryonic...

15
00:01:21,445 --> 00:01:23,120
that was here?

16
00:01:35,855 --> 00:01:36,999
I guess...

17
00:01:38,594 --> 00:01:40,639
you've succeeded in thawing them.

18
00:01:43,894 --> 00:01:45,010
Then...

19
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:48,380
who took Lee Seok Du?

20
00:02:06,555 --> 00:02:08,060
Don't kill Professor Hwang.

21
00:02:08,624 --> 00:02:10,130
If you do, you'll be done for.

22
00:02:17,395 --> 00:02:18,540
Take him.

23
00:02:28,374 --> 00:02:29,780
His body temperature is 32.8°C.

24
00:02:30,314 --> 00:02:31,919
We can't just treat him however we want.

25
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:33,889
- Did you call his guardian? - No.

26
00:02:34,745 --> 00:02:36,419
Please call...

27
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:38,929
Professor Jo Gi Bum.

28
00:02:40,784 --> 00:02:42,929
The receiver cannot be reached. You will be directed...

29
00:02:46,865 --> 00:02:48,169
Hello?

30
00:02:51,064 --> 00:02:52,570
Which hospital is it?

31
00:03:10,015 --> 00:03:14,560
(Episode 12: To Die or To Be Mad)

32
00:03:14,585 --> 00:03:18,630
(Bureau Chief, Na Ha Young)

33
00:03:18,655 --> 00:03:20,570
(Lee Hyeong Du)

34
00:03:23,365 --> 00:03:24,395
Hello?

35
00:03:24,395 --> 00:03:26,340
Seok Du has disappeared.

36
00:03:28,034 --> 00:03:30,175
They made a move before us.

37
00:03:30,175 --> 00:03:31,380
Find him!

38
00:03:46,624 --> 00:03:49,784
Isn't this Ma Dong Chan's phone?

39
00:03:49,784 --> 00:03:52,354
Yes, it is. I'm a nurse.

40
00:03:52,354 --> 00:03:54,500
He's hospitalized.

41
00:03:55,324 --> 00:03:57,239
He's hospitalized?

42
00:04:16,344 --> 00:04:18,184
The toxins are accumulating in your body.

43
00:04:18,184 --> 00:04:19,660
That's why you were in shock.

44
00:04:19,854 --> 00:04:21,554
This is a temporary antidote.

45
00:04:21,554 --> 00:04:23,900
The symptom will manifest itself once again in 48 hours.

46
00:04:24,455 --> 00:04:27,999
But this antidote won't work the second time around.

47
00:04:28,164 --> 00:04:29,799
48 hours?

48
00:04:32,965 --> 00:04:34,439
Then...

49
00:04:34,835 --> 00:04:37,549
will Mi Ran also suffer from this?

50
00:04:37,835 --> 00:04:38,980
Yes.

51
00:04:39,135 --> 00:04:41,505
There has been a variation in the LAP...

52
00:04:41,505 --> 00:04:43,350
and has turned into toxins.

53
00:04:43,544 --> 00:04:45,919
Professor Hwang had mentioned this in his note.

54
00:04:46,015 --> 00:04:48,160
He already knew this would happen.

55
00:04:48,184 --> 00:04:51,230
However, we do not have a reagent that will get rid of it permanently.

56
00:04:51,655 --> 00:04:54,299
I'm currently researching the protocol.

57
00:04:54,424 --> 00:04:57,530
But I need Professor Hwang's help.

58
00:04:57,794 --> 00:04:59,025
I need to know the code...

59
00:04:59,025 --> 00:05:01,663
for the LAP that he administered into your bodies.

60
00:05:01,664 --> 00:05:03,640
Where is he right now?

61
00:05:07,965 --> 00:05:09,210
Are you okay?

62
00:05:09,234 --> 00:05:11,350
What happened? Did you get a fever again?

63
00:05:11,974 --> 00:05:13,350
Are you okay?

64
00:05:13,945 --> 00:05:15,450
I'm fine.

65
00:05:20,015 --> 00:05:21,319
What is this?

66
00:05:24,784 --> 00:05:26,385
When did I get this bruise?

67
00:05:26,385 --> 00:05:27,799
That isn't a bruise.

68
00:05:30,025 --> 00:05:31,025
Then?

69
00:05:31,025 --> 00:05:33,224
I think the variation is happening in your body as well.

70
00:05:33,224 --> 00:05:34,869
We'll have to keep an eye on it.

71
00:05:34,994 --> 00:05:36,400
Could this be...

72
00:05:36,994 --> 00:05:39,169
lethal?

73
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:42,765
I need to see Professor Hwang right now.

74
00:05:42,765 --> 00:05:45,950
That's the problem. I cannot reach him.

75
00:05:46,534 --> 00:05:49,179
And he said something strange.

76
00:05:49,544 --> 00:05:51,020
He said he trusted me.

77
00:05:55,914 --> 00:05:57,515
- What are you doing? - I need to find him.

78
00:05:57,515 --> 00:05:58,614
There's no time.

79
00:05:58,614 --> 00:06:00,824
You just collapsed. You need to rest.

80
00:06:00,825 --> 00:06:03,400
You must remain at the hospital so we can keep an eye on you.

81
00:06:03,594 --> 00:06:05,400
I'll look for him.

82
00:06:05,854 --> 00:06:07,499
Go home.

83
00:06:07,765 --> 00:06:09,799
How can I?

84
00:06:10,794 --> 00:06:12,864
You must protect your immune system,

85
00:06:12,864 --> 00:06:14,340
so go home.

86
00:06:16,905 --> 00:06:18,509
Since when did you have this?

87
00:06:19,005 --> 00:06:20,104
I wasn't aware of it.

88
00:06:20,104 --> 00:06:21,604
How is it possible that you didn't know?

89
00:06:21,604 --> 00:06:23,520
There's something wrong on your arm.

90
00:06:26,984 --> 00:06:29,390
Go home and rest.

91
00:06:29,645 --> 00:06:31,015
I won't go.

92
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:33,499
- Go. - No.

93
00:06:42,364 --> 00:06:43,869
Professor Jo Gi Bum?

94
00:06:46,565 --> 00:06:49,580
Can you spare me a minute?

95
00:06:52,835 --> 00:06:54,319
Are those two...

96
00:06:54,945 --> 00:06:56,344
in danger?

97
00:06:56,344 --> 00:06:58,645
I need to find Professor Hwang.

98
00:06:58,645 --> 00:07:03,455
Is Professor Hwang the only one who can cure them?

99
00:07:03,455 --> 00:07:05,530
I'm currently looking for a solution.

100
00:07:10,085 --> 00:07:11,970
Where's Lee Seok Du?

101
00:07:18,164 --> 00:07:20,239
Why are you asking me that?

102
00:07:20,465 --> 00:07:22,480
Dong Chan told me.

103
00:07:22,705 --> 00:07:24,335
He told me that the current Lee Seok Du...

104
00:07:24,335 --> 00:07:27,179
isn't really him and that the real Lee Seok Du...

105
00:07:28,104 --> 00:07:30,220
has been in a capsule.

106
00:07:32,974 --> 00:07:35,059
Now, can you believe that...

107
00:07:36,244 --> 00:07:37,689
we're on the same team?

108
00:07:38,984 --> 00:07:41,255
Go home. I'll call a cab.

109
00:07:41,255 --> 00:07:43,284
Why are you trying to send me away?

110
00:07:43,284 --> 00:07:45,594
Your being here won't help me.

111
00:07:45,594 --> 00:07:47,239
My temperature will keep rising.

112
00:07:52,135 --> 00:07:53,939
Then I must go.

113
00:07:54,234 --> 00:07:56,340
All you're doing is worrying.

114
00:07:57,635 --> 00:07:59,875
I like holding hands, looking at each other,

115
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:01,850
and being happy together.

116
00:08:02,674 --> 00:08:04,150
But I don't want to be sick together.

117
00:08:05,445 --> 00:08:07,290
Fine, I'll leave.

118
00:08:08,145 --> 00:08:10,590
But don't get sick again.

119
00:08:11,284 --> 00:08:13,230
I'm all better now. Don't worry.

120
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:15,059
Call me if anything happens.

121
00:08:15,885 --> 00:08:18,770
Let's video call instead.

122
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:22,669
You love me so much, don't you?

123
00:08:24,265 --> 00:08:26,270
Yes, I do.

124
00:08:28,034 --> 00:08:29,210
Me too.

125
00:09:00,135 --> 00:09:01,265
Hello?

126
00:09:01,265 --> 00:09:03,405
Hello, I'm Professor Seo Hyun Jung,

127
00:09:03,405 --> 00:09:05,374
the cultural communications professor.

128
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:06,735
Hello.

129
00:09:06,735 --> 00:09:09,649
Have you given the essay some thought?

130
00:09:12,645 --> 00:09:16,159
Things are a bit hectic for me at the moment.

131
00:09:17,684 --> 00:09:18,889
I'm sorry.

132
00:10:01,265 --> 00:10:04,239
(Professor Hwang Gab Su)

133
00:10:06,595 --> 00:10:09,480
The receiver cannot be reached. You will be directed to voicemail.

134
00:10:16,345 --> 00:10:19,619
I think the variation is happening in your body as well.

135
00:11:12,095 --> 00:11:13,369
Professor Seo.

136
00:11:13,735 --> 00:11:15,509
This is Ko Mi Ran.

137
00:11:17,275 --> 00:11:18,980
I'll write that essay.

138
00:11:19,005 --> 00:11:20,720
I'm glad you agreed to do so.

139
00:11:20,944 --> 00:11:23,475
May I ask what changed your mind?

140
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:24,649
There's someone...

141
00:11:25,214 --> 00:11:27,519
that I love.

142
00:11:29,745 --> 00:11:33,090
But we're in an unusual situation.

143
00:11:34,725 --> 00:11:36,730
We don't know what will happen.

144
00:11:39,924 --> 00:11:43,499
I feel like I should write down our story to be remembered.

145
00:11:51,475 --> 00:11:54,019
At the age of 44, I found my first love.

146
00:11:55,304 --> 00:11:56,680
However...

147
00:12:11,424 --> 00:12:13,700
This could be my last.

148
00:12:54,964 --> 00:12:56,639
Where are you going?

149
00:12:59,434 --> 00:13:01,050
I told you to stay at home.

150
00:13:01,745 --> 00:13:03,350
I told you to stay at the hospital.

151
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:04,749
Why did you come outside?

152
00:13:07,345 --> 00:13:08,659
Because I missed you.

153
00:13:10,914 --> 00:13:14,159
Why did you send me home if you were going to come so soon?

154
00:13:21,694 --> 00:13:22,970
I told you, I'm fine.

155
00:13:34,444 --> 00:13:37,249
Do you want to get a drink with me?

156
00:13:51,794 --> 00:13:54,170
Why are there so many things I can't do?

157
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,840
I'm a bad drinker too.

158
00:14:04,804 --> 00:14:08,320
Why can't I hold the man I love as much as I want?

159
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,889
My life is unfair.

160
00:14:15,444 --> 00:14:17,930
It's not like I had the opportunity to love many people.

161
00:14:18,914 --> 00:14:20,129
This is my first time.

162
00:14:27,054 --> 00:14:28,170
Ma Dong Chan,

163
00:14:29,664 --> 00:14:31,710
why did you come into my life?

164
00:14:37,005 --> 00:14:38,279
Why did you...

165
00:14:39,434 --> 00:14:41,279
make me love you?

166
00:14:46,714 --> 00:14:49,314
I was told my life would get really lucky in 20 years,

167
00:14:49,314 --> 00:14:51,629
and that I'd meet the man I'm destined to be with.

168
00:14:53,214 --> 00:14:54,999
I finally met you,

169
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:58,070
but I'm going to die.

170
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:01,225
Who says you're going to die?

171
00:15:01,225 --> 00:15:03,639
We're going to die soon because of the side effect.

172
00:15:29,755 --> 00:15:30,970
We're not going to die.

173
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:33,499
We won't die like this.

174
00:15:34,525 --> 00:15:36,570
I'm going to drink with you,

175
00:15:37,434 --> 00:15:39,164
and spend a whole day just holding you.

176
00:15:39,164 --> 00:15:41,310
I'm even going to take you to Africa where it's hot.

177
00:15:41,735 --> 00:15:43,379
I'm going to do all of this with you.

178
00:16:06,694 --> 00:16:08,100
Why are you crying?

179
00:16:49,534 --> 00:16:51,779
I think Professor Hwang has been abducted.

180
00:16:53,275 --> 00:16:54,345
Will he be all right?

181
00:16:54,345 --> 00:16:56,050
What Lee Hyeong Du wants is Lee Seok Du.

182
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:57,745
He won't act recklessly until he finds out...

183
00:16:57,745 --> 00:16:59,220
where Lee Seok Du is.

184
00:16:59,314 --> 00:17:02,485
That person is coming on a flight early tomorrow morning, right?

185
00:17:02,485 --> 00:17:05,214
Yes. The only hope who can help us find Professor Hwang...

186
00:17:05,214 --> 00:17:06,789
is Lee Seok Du.

187
00:17:07,254 --> 00:17:10,529
We need that person in order to protect Lee Seok Du.

188
00:17:13,954 --> 00:17:16,365
By the way, Ms. Na asked me...

189
00:17:16,365 --> 00:17:18,339
where Lee Seok Du is.

190
00:17:18,635 --> 00:17:20,210
- Ha Young asked you? - Yes.

191
00:17:23,234 --> 00:17:24,349
So?

192
00:17:25,204 --> 00:17:26,380
Did you tell her?

193
00:17:44,924 --> 00:17:46,670
If they defrosted him,

194
00:17:47,055 --> 00:17:49,999
that means they're prepared to bring him back alive.

195
00:17:53,595 --> 00:17:54,809
No way.

196
00:17:55,664 --> 00:17:56,980
Could they have contacted Jung Woo?

197
00:18:11,714 --> 00:18:12,989
There's no time.

198
00:18:13,055 --> 00:18:15,900
Ma Dong Chan is scheming something.

199
00:18:16,254 --> 00:18:17,254
Dong Chan?

200
00:18:17,254 --> 00:18:19,769
Find out what he's trying to do.

201
00:18:20,194 --> 00:18:23,239
Are you ordering me right now?

202
00:18:24,595 --> 00:18:26,670
If we weigh the things we want,

203
00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:28,865
which way do you think the scale will lean?

204
00:18:28,865 --> 00:18:29,980
Did you...

205
00:18:30,635 --> 00:18:32,110
forget who I am?

206
00:18:32,905 --> 00:18:34,605
I can unveil a truth that's covered,

207
00:18:34,605 --> 00:18:37,345
or cover up a truth that should be exposed.

208
00:18:37,345 --> 00:18:39,214
On top of that, I know a fact...

209
00:18:39,214 --> 00:18:42,289
that the world will turn their attention to if it airs on the news.

210
00:18:43,444 --> 00:18:45,759
Could there be someone scarier to you?

211
00:18:45,855 --> 00:18:48,559
But you have a weakness.

212
00:18:48,954 --> 00:18:50,230
Ma Dong Chan.

213
00:18:51,454 --> 00:18:53,870
I have Professor Hwang with me.

214
00:18:54,764 --> 00:18:57,494
Without him, Dong Chan will die.

215
00:18:57,494 --> 00:18:58,610
Then,

216
00:18:59,795 --> 00:19:04,349
your other offer will be chucked out the window.

217
00:19:17,185 --> 00:19:18,330
Are you Lee Jung Woo?

218
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:25,735
How is Father doing?

219
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:30,005
He's barely hanging on. We have to hurry.

220
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,510
- Yes. - I'm driving right behind you.

221
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:41,686
Okay.

222
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:44,226
You haven't found Professor Hwang yet, right?

223
00:19:44,321 --> 00:19:45,781
We've been tracing Lee Hyeong Du,

224
00:19:45,781 --> 00:19:47,226
but we have yet to find Professor Hwang's whereabouts.

225
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,626
By the way, our boys told me...

226
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:52,936
Lee Hyeong Du met with Ms. Na last night.

227
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:54,366
Hyeong Du met with Ha Young?

228
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,606
Wait.

229
00:20:10,611 --> 00:20:13,216
They're tailing me as we expected. Let's get started.

230
00:20:13,581 --> 00:20:14,656
Okay.

231
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:16,926
Hold tight.

232
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:42,845
Father?

233
00:21:43,031 --> 00:21:44,876
He's ready for the transfusion.

234
00:21:45,141 --> 00:21:48,446
He would've been in grave danger if you hadn't come right on time.

235
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:04,795
(Certified Medical Institution by the Ministry of Health and Welfare)

236
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:29,985
Hello?

237
00:22:30,111 --> 00:22:32,325
Hey, how do you feel?

238
00:22:35,121 --> 00:22:38,335
Okay, don't come to work today. You should rest at home.

239
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,335
Okay, bye.

240
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:57,186
You can't come in here.

241
00:22:58,341 --> 00:22:59,456
But...

242
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:02,686
Lee Hyeong Du.

243
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,226
You must feel frustrated.

244
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,321
You need to settle a deal with me,

245
00:23:07,321 --> 00:23:09,891
but you also can't admit that you took Professor Hwang.

246
00:23:09,891 --> 00:23:11,765
Then how about I make an offer?

247
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:15,206
How about you give me Professor Hwang,

248
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,035
and I give you Lee Seok Du in return?

249
00:23:17,561 --> 00:23:20,676
I need Professor Hwang, and you need Lee Seok Du.

250
00:23:21,031 --> 00:23:23,676
How does that sound? Doesn't it sound intriguing?

251
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,376
Think about it carefully.

252
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,315
Professor Jo.

253
00:23:33,811 --> 00:23:35,686
Is he recovering properly?

254
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,755
Okay, thank you.

255
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:42,666
And as for Professor Hwang,

256
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:47,565
he won't be able to hurt him. You don't need to worry too much.

257
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:50,106
Okay, bye.

258
00:23:56,401 --> 00:23:58,700
- What do you want? - Why aren't you here yet?

259
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,270
"Go Go 99" is going to air soon.

260
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:01,710
You need to be here for the final editing process.

261
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:03,371
- I'm busy. - Are you kidding me?

262
00:24:03,371 --> 00:24:05,680
You're busy with something else other than work.

263
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,311
How can you proudly tell the chief that you're busy?

264
00:24:07,311 --> 00:24:08,750
I'm saying I'm busy because I am.

265
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,281
When are you going to come to work?

266
00:24:10,281 --> 00:24:11,555
I'm on my way.

267
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:17,821
Take a look at what's written here and organize the information.

268
00:24:17,821 --> 00:24:20,091
- Okay. - Ask me if you have any questions.

269
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:21,406
- Okay? - Okay.

270
00:24:21,831 --> 00:24:23,505
Is there anything else you'd like to ask?

271
00:24:23,591 --> 00:24:25,331
I'll give it a try first.

272
00:24:25,331 --> 00:24:27,005
I'll try organizing everything.

273
00:24:27,401 --> 00:24:29,631
Mi Ran, we didn't get to eat dinner last time.

274
00:24:29,631 --> 00:24:30,976
So how about we eat dinner today?

275
00:24:31,371 --> 00:24:33,700
Ji Hoon, I'm sorry. Can we eat together next time?

276
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,071
It's because you seem really down these days.

277
00:24:36,071 --> 00:24:37,686
I'll brighten up your mood.

278
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:40,541
My gosh, you're so kind.

279
00:24:40,541 --> 00:24:43,626
Hey, what are you guys doing?

280
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:45,156
Get back to work.

281
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,950
Hey, Intern.

282
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:49,091
Didn't I tell you not to socialize with another intern?

283
00:24:49,091 --> 00:24:50,351
You'll learn nothing from her.

284
00:24:50,351 --> 00:24:52,121
And I told you not to be so kind...

285
00:24:52,121 --> 00:24:54,235
to the other female employees.

286
00:24:55,331 --> 00:24:57,631
Mi Ran and I were friends before I even started working here.

287
00:24:57,631 --> 00:24:59,735
Please don't get the wrong idea.

288
00:25:00,831 --> 00:25:02,930
You're friends? Who says you can be friends?

289
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:05,571
The thing is, he's my friend's son.

290
00:25:05,571 --> 00:25:07,146
He's your friend's son?

291
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,845
Then why are you treating her like she's your friend?

292
00:25:09,141 --> 00:25:11,456
You should be treating her with more respect.

293
00:25:11,641 --> 00:25:13,641
Plus, I'm not friends with any of my mom's friends.

294
00:25:13,641 --> 00:25:15,386
She's not exactly young enough to be your friend.

295
00:25:16,311 --> 00:25:17,750
And tell me something, Intern.

296
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,956
How exactly are you going to brighten up her mood?

297
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:24,166
I'm sorry, but I don't really get why you're so upset right now.

298
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,285
Do you think I'm joking around?

299
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:43,940
Who ever said you were joking around?

300
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,686
I told you to stay at home.

301
00:25:50,381 --> 00:25:51,581
What's wrong?

302
00:25:51,581 --> 00:25:53,250
I'm okay.

303
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:54,591
Don't lie to me. Let me see.

304
00:25:54,591 --> 00:25:57,396
No, it's okay. I'm fine.

305
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,936
I'm really okay.

306
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:01,706
Dong Chan.

307
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:05,331
Yes, what's up?

308
00:26:05,331 --> 00:26:06,436
Well...

309
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,301
Were you guys talking about work?

310
00:26:08,301 --> 00:26:11,101
Yes, that's exactly what we were doing.

311
00:26:11,101 --> 00:26:13,269
- But your hands... - No, we were talking about work.

312
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:15,345
Oh, okay. Go ahead.

313
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,656
My gosh, he startled me.

314
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,186
You don't think he saw us, right?

315
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:26,656
- We were really fast. - He couldn't have seen us.

316
00:26:28,651 --> 00:26:30,466
Why are you so busy these days?

317
00:26:34,631 --> 00:26:37,331
I finally tracked down the IP address.

318
00:26:37,331 --> 00:26:38,331
What IP address?

319
00:26:38,331 --> 00:26:41,176
The person who wrote that post about Ko Mi Ran.

320
00:26:41,371 --> 00:26:43,045
It took me a lot of effort to track it down.

321
00:26:43,131 --> 00:26:44,841
You're the one who wanted me to track it down.

322
00:26:44,841 --> 00:26:46,845
You told me you'll think it was me if I don't find who it was.

323
00:26:46,871 --> 00:26:48,545
Oh, right. Good work.

324
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:51,985
- That's it? - Is Ha Young in her office?

325
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:54,651
Dong Chan, I'm not her secretary.

326
00:26:54,651 --> 00:26:55,811
Is President Kim in his office?

327
00:26:55,811 --> 00:26:56,985
Dong Chan!

328
00:27:00,621 --> 00:27:03,250
You should go see him. He's been looking for you all morning.

329
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:04,426
Okay.

330
00:27:10,427 --> 00:27:15,427


331
00:27:20,541 --> 00:27:23,285
You came to work really late today.

332
00:27:23,571 --> 00:27:25,180
What were you busy doing all morning?

333
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,815
Why do you want to know?

334
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:28,480
Dong Chan.

335
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,285
But then again, I also want to know...

336
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:32,095
what you did that night.

337
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:35,896
What? "That night"?

338
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:44,876
My goodness. Don't worry, sir.

339
00:27:45,131 --> 00:27:47,361
Dong Chan is a variety show director.

340
00:27:47,361 --> 00:27:50,270
There's nothing much he can do.

341
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:53,045
Chairman Lee is very bothered by him.

342
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,170
Why don't you create a project where he has to work abroad...

343
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:56,371
and send him overseas?

344
00:27:56,371 --> 00:27:59,739
He won't go just because I tell him to go.

345
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:02,525
And he won't come just because I tell him to come.

346
00:28:03,151 --> 00:28:04,456
He's here.

347
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,950
I'll call you back.

348
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:08,226
Okay, bye.

349
00:28:08,321 --> 00:28:09,825
Were you talking about me?

350
00:28:09,891 --> 00:28:11,495
You look really startled.

351
00:28:11,621 --> 00:28:14,366
My gosh, what are you talking about?

352
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,930
What brings you here?

353
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:18,631
I don't have much time.

354
00:28:18,631 --> 00:28:21,000
I need to differentiate my enemies from my allies.

355
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,876
So let me be straightforward and ask you something.

356
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,176
President Kim.

357
00:28:25,071 --> 00:28:26,815
Do you know who Lee Hyeong Du is?

358
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:29,845
"Lee Hyeong Du"?

359
00:28:31,071 --> 00:28:32,186
No, I don't.

360
00:28:32,641 --> 00:28:33,956
Okay, then.

361
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:36,255
Do you know that Lee Seok Du and Lee Hyeong Du are twins...

362
00:28:36,311 --> 00:28:37,950
and that Lee Hyeong Du is just an imposter...

363
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,321
who's pretending to be Lee Seok Du?

364
00:28:39,321 --> 00:28:41,255
What? What did you just say?

365
00:28:41,291 --> 00:28:44,051
Do you also know that the real Lee Seok Du was in a frozen capsule?

366
00:28:44,051 --> 00:28:45,920
Are you telling me...

367
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,291
that there were other people there other than you and Mi Ran?

368
00:28:48,291 --> 00:28:51,631
But Lee Hyeong Du is the person who's helping you...

369
00:28:51,631 --> 00:28:52,831
become a politician, isn't he?

370
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:55,470
Hey, I really have no idea what you're...

371
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:58,446
It'd be best for you to find another sponsor.

372
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:01,845
That sponsor of yours is completely rotten and useless.

373
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,881
President Kim, that guy took...

374
00:29:11,881 --> 00:29:13,825
Professor Hwang.

375
00:29:17,091 --> 00:29:18,361
Do you really not know anything?

376
00:29:18,361 --> 00:29:21,759
I really don't get what you're talking about.

377
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,230
What do you mean they're twins?

378
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:27,606
And who in the world is Lee Hyeong Du?

379
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:29,745
Where did he go?

380
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:37,015
Why do you want to know?

381
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:38,815
But then again, I also want to know...

382
00:29:39,881 --> 00:29:41,426
what you did that night.

383
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:56,636
("Go Go 99" Credits)

384
00:30:06,071 --> 00:30:07,646
Are you making the closing credits?

385
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:10,216
I have the cast list.

386
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:12,116
Oh, I see. I'll take that.

387
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:15,825
You don't look so well.

388
00:30:17,281 --> 00:30:18,696
No, I'm okay.

389
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,495
I'm sorry, Mi Ran.

390
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,426
You must've been through a lot.

391
00:30:23,351 --> 00:30:24,525
What do you mean?

392
00:30:25,321 --> 00:30:26,565
I'm talking about my dad.

393
00:30:28,361 --> 00:30:29,791
You don't need to apologize on behalf of him.

394
00:30:29,791 --> 00:30:32,775
Please think of me separately from my dad.

395
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:37,676
Don't worry.

396
00:30:45,141 --> 00:30:46,356
Hello?

397
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,456
Hey, Young Sun.

398
00:30:53,881 --> 00:30:56,926
Are you sick? You don't look so well.

399
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,666
No, I'm okay.

400
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:01,235
I'm relieved to hear that.

401
00:31:04,801 --> 00:31:06,005
Mi Ran.

402
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,476
You can't date Ji Hoon.

403
00:31:10,071 --> 00:31:12,470
- Young Sun. - Guys in their 20s...

404
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:14,376
are all full of passion.

405
00:31:15,071 --> 00:31:16,470
If they like someone,

406
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:19,255
they don't care about the woman's age.

407
00:31:19,381 --> 00:31:21,525
They're very naive and passionate at that age.

408
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:26,196
And if a kid like him starts showing that he likes you,

409
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:29,765
we should try to talk him out of it since we're adults.

410
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:33,035
That's what we should do as people who are older than him.

411
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,436
Young Sun.

412
00:31:37,631 --> 00:31:39,835
Your son's 20 years old, and you think of him like a kid.

413
00:31:40,601 --> 00:31:43,045
Meanwhile, I've lived for 24 years, and you think of me like an adult.

414
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,275
You're right.

415
00:31:47,871 --> 00:31:51,146
You didn't live as much as I did.

416
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,656
You have changed...

417
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:56,426
so much.

418
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:00,825
You used to have trouble differentiating words.

419
00:32:02,321 --> 00:32:04,325
But now, you're so thoughtful.

420
00:32:05,361 --> 00:32:06,795
You're a grown-up now.

421
00:32:11,031 --> 00:32:12,136
You know what?

422
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,575
I'm in love.

423
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,545
Are you dating?

424
00:32:21,611 --> 00:32:22,686
Yes.

425
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,956
(Here is the IP address of the ID you've requested.)

426
00:32:29,851 --> 00:32:33,651
All right. So the person who wrote that online...

427
00:32:33,651 --> 00:32:34,896
was at this cafe?

428
00:32:35,851 --> 00:32:37,595
Okay. I got it.

429
00:32:48,831 --> 00:32:49,976
This is it.

430
00:32:50,531 --> 00:32:52,045
But how do I catch them?

431
00:32:54,811 --> 00:32:56,245
So that's what happened.

432
00:33:00,611 --> 00:33:01,926
Is it important or not?

433
00:33:02,551 --> 00:33:03,551
It is.

434
00:33:03,551 --> 00:33:05,926
Mi Ran, what brings you here?

435
00:33:06,321 --> 00:33:08,396
I came to meet my friend during my lunchtime.

436
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:11,325
- This is her cafe. - Hello.

437
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:32,215
(Ko Mi Ran)

438
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:39,595
(Editing Room A)

439
00:34:00,741 --> 00:34:03,546
How about we do this? Follow me.

440
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,916
- Where are we going? - Just follow me.

441
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,316
Where are we going?

442
00:34:11,511 --> 00:34:12,595
Let's go.

443
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:15,296
You need to tell me where.

444
00:34:20,321 --> 00:34:21,635
Are they...

445
00:34:54,161 --> 00:34:56,436
"M, 3, 4".

446
00:35:04,071 --> 00:35:06,715
I thought Mi Ran was going to come after work, but you're here early.

447
00:35:07,801 --> 00:35:11,186
What? Were you going to come here?

448
00:35:11,571 --> 00:35:12,686
Yes.

449
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:17,155
By the way, he has the same thing.

450
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:22,526
It's progressing around the same time.

451
00:35:26,721 --> 00:35:29,336
Sir, no matter what happens,

452
00:35:30,131 --> 00:35:31,436
do save him.

453
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:34,405
Cure him first. We have no time.

454
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,146
This is a temporary antidote.

455
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:45,555
The symptom will manifest itself once again in 48 hours.

456
00:36:15,741 --> 00:36:16,845
Dong Chan.

457
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:19,316
Are you feeling unwell?

458
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:23,356
Why did you meet Lee Hyeong Du?

459
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:29,296
Why do you want to know where Lee Seok Du is?

460
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:35,035
Why haven't you covered this case yet?

461
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:41,976
Don't do anything shameful.

462
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:44,575
Stop here.

463
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:51,586
You need to know how it feels.

464
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,411
To have aged...

465
00:36:56,411 --> 00:36:59,095
but for the person you love to still be shining brightly.

466
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:03,026
To be rejected by that person for being old and worn out.

467
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:04,890
To have aged...

468
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:07,765
but still be passionately in love with that person.

469
00:37:10,661 --> 00:37:12,336
You need to feel the pain.

470
00:37:15,201 --> 00:37:16,405
You must.

471
00:37:24,971 --> 00:37:27,615
- Please leave. - I need to find Professor Hwang.

472
00:37:28,951 --> 00:37:30,126
I'm running out of time.

473
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,095
Please help me.

474
00:37:51,971 --> 00:37:53,646
- By the way... - I think...

475
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:56,916
I was told something that I shouldn't have known.

476
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,015
And it's something so intense.

477
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:01,356
Me too.

478
00:38:03,551 --> 00:38:04,925
What do you know?

479
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,356
You go first.

480
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,226
It's nothing you should know.

481
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:16,491
(Bureau Chief, Na Ha Young)

482
00:38:16,491 --> 00:38:18,135
I need to find Professor Hwang.

483
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:21,206
I'm running out of time. Please help me.

484
00:38:35,451 --> 00:38:38,186
It's me. If you want to find Lee Seok Du,

485
00:38:39,051 --> 00:38:41,555
send Professor Hwang back to them right now.

486
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:44,296
Did Dong Chan tell you to do this?

487
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:47,495
I'm going to report the disappearance of Professor Hwang.

488
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:51,305
I'm going to do an exclusive and report all the facts...

489
00:38:52,131 --> 00:38:53,476
regarding that case.

490
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:57,905
But if you let him go,

491
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,615
I won't do it.

492
00:39:02,471 --> 00:39:04,111
(Lee Seok Du)

493
00:39:04,111 --> 00:39:06,785
Put Ko Mi Ran back into the cryonic capsule.

494
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:09,785
That's our deal.

495
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:11,956
You...

496
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,226
What are you planning to do?

497
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:17,526
You were blinded by love and acted too rashly.

498
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:24,465
I'm considering releasing this to the press right now.

499
00:39:32,971 --> 00:39:34,675
You need to know how it feels.

500
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:36,670
To have aged...

501
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:39,385
but for the person you love to still be shining brightly.

502
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:43,155
To be rejected by that person for being old and worn out.

503
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,080
To have aged...

504
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:48,055
but still be passionately in love with that person.

505
00:39:49,491 --> 00:39:51,166
You need to feel the pain.

506
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:53,635
You must.

507
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:05,200
I've attached a photo of him and checked the time.

508
00:40:05,201 --> 00:40:07,316
All right, good work. I'll wrap it up.

509
00:40:26,318 --> 00:40:28,803
- Are you in here? - Yes, I am.

510
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:35,033
What were you watching in here?

511
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:37,004
Well... I was just...

512
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:38,774
What is it?

513
00:40:39,898 --> 00:40:41,614
The person who wrote the post about Mi Ran...

514
00:40:43,618 --> 00:40:45,903
turned out to be her friend who runs a cafe.

515
00:40:48,859 --> 00:40:50,673
- Really? - Yes.

516
00:40:50,759 --> 00:40:53,173
Okay, I got it. You can go.

517
00:40:53,899 --> 00:40:55,199
Is that all?

518
00:40:55,199 --> 00:40:56,274
Yes.

519
00:40:56,868 --> 00:40:58,668
Is it because you're afraid your girlfriend...

520
00:40:58,669 --> 00:41:00,184
will get hurt?

521
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:03,153
I got a strange vibe,

522
00:41:03,739 --> 00:41:05,354
but I didn't know you two would date.

523
00:41:12,089 --> 00:41:13,294
Right.

524
00:41:14,518 --> 00:41:16,693
Don't tell Mi Ran about her friend...

525
00:41:16,759 --> 00:41:18,164
who wrote that post.

526
00:41:18,259 --> 00:41:19,564
Not to your girlfriend either.

527
00:41:20,089 --> 00:41:21,658
What are you talking about?

528
00:41:21,658 --> 00:41:22,899
The three of them are friends.

529
00:41:22,899 --> 00:41:24,629
You know, Mi Ran's friend...

530
00:41:24,629 --> 00:41:25,827
you were seeing in secret on the set of "Go Go 99".

531
00:41:25,828 --> 00:41:27,044
Your girlfriend.

532
00:41:27,469 --> 00:41:28,673
I know everything.

533
00:41:32,308 --> 00:41:33,783
What do I do? What?

534
00:41:46,089 --> 00:41:48,494
Gosh, you must have been stressed out lately.

535
00:41:48,618 --> 00:41:49,618
Darling.

536
00:41:49,618 --> 00:41:50,819
Yes, honey?

537
00:41:50,819 --> 00:41:53,803
Dong Chan found out about us.

538
00:41:54,288 --> 00:41:55,928
How did he find out?

539
00:41:55,928 --> 00:41:58,299
Do you know what's more shocking?

540
00:41:58,299 --> 00:42:00,129
- What? - Dong Chan and Mi Ran...

541
00:42:00,129 --> 00:42:01,403
are dating.

542
00:42:02,669 --> 00:42:04,943
If they have a baby,

543
00:42:05,138 --> 00:42:06,783
it'd be an ice baby.

544
00:42:08,739 --> 00:42:11,439
Should we relocate?

545
00:42:11,439 --> 00:42:13,584
- There are too many eyes on us. - Right.

546
00:42:13,848 --> 00:42:16,553
What is it? Are you embarrassed by me?

547
00:42:16,978 --> 00:42:18,553
It's not that, darling.

548
00:42:19,719 --> 00:42:22,558
Right. I have one more thing to tell you.

549
00:42:22,558 --> 00:42:26,164
The one that wrote the post about Mi Ran's identity...

550
00:42:26,558 --> 00:42:28,463
is your friend who runs a cafe.

551
00:42:29,029 --> 00:42:32,529
You should know what kind of person your friend is.

552
00:42:32,529 --> 00:42:34,529
What? Young Sun?

553
00:42:34,529 --> 00:42:36,874
- Yes. - That's impossible.

554
00:42:38,169 --> 00:42:39,383
One second.

555
00:42:41,439 --> 00:42:42,814
(Young Sun)

556
00:42:43,609 --> 00:42:44,808
Hello?

557
00:42:44,808 --> 00:42:46,077
Yes. It's me.

558
00:42:46,078 --> 00:42:48,153
I know. You're a witch.

559
00:42:48,178 --> 00:42:50,549
You shouldn't live like that.

560
00:42:50,549 --> 00:42:52,049
I understand why you don't like Mi Ran,

561
00:42:52,049 --> 00:42:53,664
but how could you do that to a friend?

562
00:42:53,848 --> 00:42:55,888
You better not call me for a while, witch.

563
00:42:55,888 --> 00:42:56,963
What?

564
00:42:57,759 --> 00:42:58,903
Gosh.

565
00:43:00,228 --> 00:43:01,859
- Honey. - Yes?

566
00:43:01,859 --> 00:43:05,133
How about a nice bowl of warm fish cake soup?

567
00:43:05,469 --> 00:43:07,744
We could have shots of soju to go along with it.

568
00:43:08,768 --> 00:43:10,044
Shall we?

569
00:43:12,069 --> 00:43:13,414
Do you know a good place?

570
00:43:13,808 --> 00:43:15,483
- I know many. - Let's go.

571
00:43:15,808 --> 00:43:18,354
What was that about? Gosh.

572
00:43:19,049 --> 00:43:20,678
I'll get going, ma'am.

573
00:43:20,678 --> 00:43:22,193
Okay.

574
00:43:22,919 --> 00:43:25,788
I thought you wanted to work here so you could work at the station.

575
00:43:25,788 --> 00:43:27,518
Did you give up on finding a job there?

576
00:43:27,518 --> 00:43:30,994
Yes. I don't want to work at the station anymore.

577
00:43:31,388 --> 00:43:34,264
The people there are mean and unfair.

578
00:43:35,498 --> 00:43:37,498
Thank you for everything, ma'am.

579
00:43:37,498 --> 00:43:39,774
Sure. It was nice having you.

580
00:43:41,098 --> 00:43:42,299
- Chae Yeon. - Yes?

581
00:43:42,299 --> 00:43:43,899
You should log out from your account.

582
00:43:43,899 --> 00:43:45,914
It's okay. That's not my ID anyway.

583
00:43:50,439 --> 00:43:53,184
Put Ko Mi Ran back into the cryonic capsule.

584
00:43:53,678 --> 00:43:55,949
That's our deal.

585
00:43:55,949 --> 00:43:58,819
You were blinded by love and acted too rashly.

586
00:43:58,819 --> 00:44:02,533
I'm considering releasing this to the press right now.

587
00:44:04,859 --> 00:44:06,359
Look for Professor Jo.

588
00:44:06,359 --> 00:44:07,604
He knows...

589
00:44:10,699 --> 00:44:12,974
where Lee Seok Du is.

590
00:44:14,428 --> 00:44:16,374
I need to find Professor Hwang.

591
00:44:16,669 --> 00:44:18,073
I'm running out of time.

592
00:44:20,939 --> 00:44:22,314
Please help me.

593
00:44:48,029 --> 00:44:49,343
(Na Ha Young)

594
00:44:51,498 --> 00:44:52,644
Hello?

595
00:44:52,969 --> 00:44:54,144
It's me.

596
00:44:54,569 --> 00:44:56,454
Why did you call me? What are you trying to find out?

597
00:44:57,038 --> 00:44:58,779
Professor Jo is in danger.

598
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:00,624
I called to tell you that.

599
00:45:02,678 --> 00:45:04,923
Ever since his car explosion incident,

600
00:45:05,178 --> 00:45:07,549
the police have been with him at the lab.

601
00:45:07,549 --> 00:45:09,363
That's why Lee Hyeong Du couldn't do anything to him.

602
00:45:10,489 --> 00:45:12,428
Lee Hyeong Du knows the police aren't at the lab anymore.

603
00:45:12,428 --> 00:45:13,704
You should warn Professor Jo.

604
00:45:14,589 --> 00:45:16,073
How did he know that?

605
00:45:18,868 --> 00:45:20,073
Because I...

606
00:45:24,098 --> 00:45:26,283
Because I told him.

607
00:45:49,158 --> 00:45:50,228
It's me.

608
00:45:50,228 --> 00:45:51,299
Yes?

609
00:45:51,299 --> 00:45:53,428
Can you go to Professor Jo's lab now?

610
00:45:53,428 --> 00:45:54,604
You need to hurry.

611
00:46:39,109 --> 00:46:40,408
You, guard at the front of the lab.

612
00:46:40,408 --> 00:46:41,708
The rest of you can standby outside.

613
00:46:41,708 --> 00:46:42,854
Yes, sir.

614
00:46:49,859 --> 00:46:50,958
(Cold-hearted Punk)

615
00:46:50,958 --> 00:46:52,428
Don't go anywhere...

616
00:46:52,428 --> 00:46:54,434
and stick right beside Professor Jo.

617
00:46:54,489 --> 00:46:56,604
We don't know what kind of symptoms might show.

618
00:47:06,208 --> 00:47:08,014
"Maito Magick"?

619
00:47:08,509 --> 00:47:09,814
What is this?

620
00:47:10,638 --> 00:47:12,184
"Maito Magick"?

621
00:47:13,248 --> 00:47:15,184
You have my trust.

622
00:47:15,549 --> 00:47:17,854
M, 3, 4.

623
00:47:21,149 --> 00:47:22,294
M,

624
00:47:23,819 --> 00:47:25,093
3, 4.

625
00:47:32,299 --> 00:47:34,673
Maito Magick number 34.

626
00:47:46,478 --> 00:47:48,053
I've moved out of Mi Ran's house.

627
00:47:50,919 --> 00:47:54,018
I'll stay here until I find a new place.

628
00:47:54,018 --> 00:47:56,533
No. Get out.

629
00:48:01,689 --> 00:48:02,874
Dad.

630
00:48:08,598 --> 00:48:11,173
Hwang Byung Sim, Hwang Ji Hoon.

631
00:48:12,669 --> 00:48:14,644
You two must really be father and son.

632
00:48:15,038 --> 00:48:17,483
You have the same taste in women.

633
00:48:20,978 --> 00:48:23,124
I'm so embarrassed...

634
00:48:23,219 --> 00:48:24,494
to see people.

635
00:48:27,689 --> 00:48:30,564
I gave up on Mi Ran.

636
00:48:31,288 --> 00:48:32,633
The reason is,

637
00:48:32,928 --> 00:48:35,288
more than being Mi Ran's first love,

638
00:48:35,288 --> 00:48:37,799
I believe it's more valuable to be your father.

639
00:48:37,799 --> 00:48:40,029
I compared it on a balance sheet, and that's what I got.

640
00:48:40,029 --> 00:48:41,303
Thank you, Dad.

641
00:48:41,469 --> 00:48:43,774
Can I start dating Mi Ran now?

642
00:48:44,138 --> 00:48:46,669
- What? - She's my type.

643
00:48:46,669 --> 00:48:47,983
You punk.

644
00:48:48,138 --> 00:48:49,978
If your father steps back in such a cool way,

645
00:48:49,978 --> 00:48:52,279
you should say something really cool too.

646
00:48:52,279 --> 00:48:54,109
What do you mean, you'll date her? What are you saying?

647
00:48:54,109 --> 00:48:56,753
You didn't step back. You were pushed back.

648
00:48:57,949 --> 00:49:00,748
No. Mi Ran is my friend.

649
00:49:00,748 --> 00:49:02,463
What's wrong with that?

650
00:49:02,489 --> 00:49:04,089
It's better than dating the mom of a friend.

651
00:49:04,089 --> 00:49:05,233
Gosh.

652
00:49:06,029 --> 00:49:07,888
Is it because you're interning at the Variety Department?

653
00:49:07,888 --> 00:49:10,503
Are you making a joke? How is that any better?

654
00:49:10,529 --> 00:49:13,374
How is it any different? A friend's mom versus Mom's friend?

655
00:49:13,699 --> 00:49:14,969
That's not what I mean.

656
00:49:14,969 --> 00:49:16,443
Both of you, shut your mouths!

657
00:49:16,669 --> 00:49:17,839
I won't allow it.

658
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:20,244
Gosh. It's Dong Chan's fault.

659
00:49:20,308 --> 00:49:22,538
I'm sure he ruined you.

660
00:49:22,538 --> 00:49:25,653
Mi Ran has a boyfriend.

661
00:49:53,308 --> 00:49:54,883
You two should go home.

662
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:57,084
I'll finish this even if I have to stay up all night.

663
00:49:57,308 --> 00:49:58,914
I'll be in touch, Mr. Ma.

664
00:49:59,078 --> 00:50:00,224
Okay.

665
00:50:14,189 --> 00:50:15,463
Sweet dreams.

666
00:50:16,629 --> 00:50:17,834
You too, honey.

667
00:50:20,129 --> 00:50:21,204
"Honey"...

668
00:50:21,569 --> 00:50:22,914
I'll pick you up tomorrow morning.

669
00:50:24,399 --> 00:50:26,868
I'll go with Dad tomorrow.

670
00:50:26,868 --> 00:50:27,908
Why?

671
00:50:27,908 --> 00:50:29,753
He wants to do it.

672
00:50:30,779 --> 00:50:32,014
All right.

673
00:50:32,509 --> 00:50:33,649
You should hurry home.

674
00:50:33,649 --> 00:50:35,779
After we resolve things one by one,

675
00:50:35,779 --> 00:50:38,423
we'll be able to live just like ordinary people.

676
00:50:38,748 --> 00:50:41,224
After we take the reagent and find Professor Hwang again,

677
00:50:41,489 --> 00:50:43,834
we just need to get the treatment to get our body temperatures normal.

678
00:50:44,859 --> 00:50:45,934
You're right.

679
00:50:47,558 --> 00:50:48,633
See you, then.

680
00:51:22,458 --> 00:51:25,803
But this antidote hasn't gone through a clinical trial.

681
00:51:26,998 --> 00:51:29,914
So one person needs to get the injection first.

682
00:51:32,469 --> 00:51:35,184
I'll get the injection first.

683
00:51:36,239 --> 00:51:38,354
If I turn out to be fine,

684
00:51:38,908 --> 00:51:40,354
you can give it to him.

685
00:51:46,788 --> 00:51:49,334
Hey, Professor Jo. I'll be on my way soon.

686
00:51:49,458 --> 00:51:50,994
Is Mi Ran there already?

687
00:51:51,388 --> 00:51:53,264
Yes, she's here. But the thing is,

688
00:51:54,158 --> 00:51:57,173
Mi Ran already got the injection.

689
00:51:59,368 --> 00:52:00,474
What?

690
00:52:22,958 --> 00:52:24,633
It's been two hours since she got the injection.

691
00:52:24,888 --> 00:52:26,403
I think the antidote works.

692
00:52:30,458 --> 00:52:31,934
Why did you get the injection first?

693
00:52:34,098 --> 00:52:36,144
Because I wanted to get the antidote before you.

694
00:52:36,638 --> 00:52:39,713
Why do you always do everything first?

695
00:53:14,808 --> 00:53:18,783
This reminds me of the day I first met you guys 20 years ago.

696
00:53:19,078 --> 00:53:21,053
For 20 years,

697
00:53:21,578 --> 00:53:23,923
you guys were frozen and asleep.

698
00:53:24,678 --> 00:53:27,363
But on the other hand, I've seen you guys for 20 years.

699
00:53:27,848 --> 00:53:30,193
I guess that's why I'm not surprised to see that you're dating.

700
00:53:32,219 --> 00:53:34,564
I guess we were meant to be.

701
00:53:36,629 --> 00:53:38,604
We were destined to be with each other.

702
00:54:01,719 --> 00:54:03,394
You both need to keep this in mind.

703
00:54:03,788 --> 00:54:05,558
This is just an antidote.

704
00:54:05,558 --> 00:54:07,604
It's not a cure that will bring your body temperature back to normal.

705
00:54:07,958 --> 00:54:12,434
You both need to keep maintaining a body temperature of 31.5?.

706
00:54:48,728 --> 00:54:49,814
Let me see.

707
00:55:00,879 --> 00:55:05,153
Today, the pilot episode of "Go Go 99" is finally going to air.

708
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:06,994
It's truly a historical moment.

709
00:55:07,089 --> 00:55:08,719
It was planned by Ko Mi Ran...

710
00:55:08,719 --> 00:55:10,394
and directed by Director Ma Dong Chan.

711
00:55:10,859 --> 00:55:14,204
But where is Director Ma?

712
00:55:16,799 --> 00:55:18,998
I saw him working in the editing room earlier.

713
00:55:18,998 --> 00:55:21,368
He's been in there for days.

714
00:55:21,368 --> 00:55:22,629
I can't believe he isn't done yet.

715
00:55:22,629 --> 00:55:26,113
My gosh, he really lost it. It's because he's old.

716
00:55:27,439 --> 00:55:28,613
And one more thing.

717
00:55:29,009 --> 00:55:32,514
If you're dating a colleague, please be extra careful.

718
00:55:32,609 --> 00:55:34,323
People are bound to make fun of you.

719
00:55:34,509 --> 00:55:36,553
And every couple ended up getting caught.

720
00:55:54,129 --> 00:55:55,443
It's all done.

721
00:56:01,969 --> 00:56:03,053
Mi Ran.

722
00:56:04,908 --> 00:56:06,524
Are you dating Director Ma?

723
00:56:08,509 --> 00:56:10,494
- Yes. - I'll wait for you.

724
00:56:11,319 --> 00:56:12,823
I'm still very young.

725
00:56:13,248 --> 00:56:15,394
- Don't be such a kid. - Stop drawing a line.

726
00:56:15,589 --> 00:56:17,294
We're only four years apart.

727
00:56:24,359 --> 00:56:26,598
The pilot episode of "Go Go 99" is going to begin soon, right?

728
00:56:26,598 --> 00:56:29,573
- Yes, should we watch it here? - No.

729
00:56:29,939 --> 00:56:32,469
Let's watch it with the employees in the lobby.

730
00:56:32,469 --> 00:56:33,544
Okay.

731
00:56:34,339 --> 00:56:35,783
Did you watch the roughly edited version?

732
00:56:35,908 --> 00:56:38,178
Yes, it's fun.

733
00:56:38,178 --> 00:56:41,708
Dong Chan really is the best. The show's bound to do well.

734
00:56:41,708 --> 00:56:43,078
He's so focused on the details.

735
00:56:43,078 --> 00:56:45,854
He's been editing in the editing room for days now.

736
00:56:45,919 --> 00:56:49,593
Hyun Gi, do you hear that? I hear the ratings going up.

737
00:56:49,819 --> 00:56:51,664
Listen to that.

738
00:56:53,328 --> 00:56:54,629
What's taking him so long?

739
00:56:54,629 --> 00:56:56,204
We're going to air the advertisements soon.

740
00:56:58,558 --> 00:56:59,598
Hello?

741
00:56:59,598 --> 00:57:02,299
I'm sorry for being late. I just sent you the file.

742
00:57:02,299 --> 00:57:03,914
I thought there was a problem.

743
00:57:05,299 --> 00:57:06,883
He sent the file. Standby.

744
00:57:18,049 --> 00:57:20,794
("Go Go 99")

745
00:57:22,348 --> 00:57:23,618
Okay, everyone.

746
00:57:23,618 --> 00:57:25,564
- I'm so nervous. - We're finally watching the show.

747
00:57:26,228 --> 00:57:27,334
("Go Go 99")

748
00:57:35,029 --> 00:57:36,138
Let's go!

749
00:57:36,138 --> 00:57:37,498
I love the introduction.

750
00:57:37,498 --> 00:57:38,613
I'm Dong Sik.

751
00:57:40,109 --> 00:57:42,908
- I am ground, introduce yourself. - I am ground, introduce yourself.

752
00:57:42,908 --> 00:57:45,879
During my childhood

753
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:47,549
I once had a beautiful dream

754
00:57:47,549 --> 00:57:49,919
- For youth! - For youth!

755
00:57:49,919 --> 00:57:52,894
(Let's Go Back to 1999! "Go Go 99")

756
00:57:53,089 --> 00:57:55,719
- What's going on? - What's this?

757
00:57:55,719 --> 00:57:57,434
- Something's wrong. - What's the matter?

758
00:57:57,558 --> 00:57:58,733
What's going on?

759
00:58:00,958 --> 00:58:03,533
Please save my husband. The cryonic capsule...

760
00:58:12,299 --> 00:58:14,283
What happened to her...

761
00:58:14,839 --> 00:58:17,578
on that night of 2019?

762
00:58:17,578 --> 00:58:19,823
(What happened to her on that night of 2019?)

763
00:58:21,178 --> 00:58:24,053
- Shouldn't we stop this? - No, let's leave it.

764
00:58:24,719 --> 00:58:26,153
(What happened to her on that night of 2019?)

765
00:58:28,419 --> 00:58:30,033
On that night of 1999,

766
00:58:34,629 --> 00:58:36,498
we were waiting to be thawed after having participated...

767
00:58:36,498 --> 00:58:37,958
in the experiment for 24 hours.

768
00:58:37,958 --> 00:58:40,774
But what in the world happened to us that night?

769
00:58:50,708 --> 00:58:53,379
The two incidents may seem totally irrelevant from each other.

770
00:58:53,379 --> 00:58:54,524
He's...

771
00:58:58,618 --> 00:58:59,794
But this guy was behind both incidents.

772
00:59:00,819 --> 00:59:01,888
He's Lee Hyeong Du,

773
00:59:01,888 --> 00:59:04,593
the younger brother of Unsung Group's chairman, Lee Seok Du.

774
00:59:07,689 --> 00:59:09,104
What the...

775
00:59:10,058 --> 00:59:11,133
My goodness.

776
00:59:24,009 --> 00:59:25,184
Is that really true?

777
00:59:28,149 --> 00:59:29,283
I am...

778
00:59:31,118 --> 00:59:33,093
the real Lee Seok Du.
