00:15:39.188 --> 00:15:41.245
<b>I'm here for your daughter.</b>

00:15:48.297 --> 00:15:50.115
<b>Guk-bong!</b>

00:15:50.299 --> 00:15:52.755
<b>Let's not be so unethical!</b>

00:15:53.369 --> 00:15:54.785
<b>Ms. Mi-dong.</b>

00:15:59.241 --> 00:16:00.640
<b>Who is that?</b>

00:16:00.643 --> 00:16:02.995
<b>Is he talking about Seo-woo?</b>

00:16:06.082 --> 00:16:08.950
<b>Take a break, Ms. Mi-dong.</b>

00:16:08.951 --> 00:16:10.880
<b>I said I'd take care of them.</b>

00:16:10.886 --> 00:16:12.405
<b>Until when?</b>

00:16:12.655 --> 00:16:16.390
<b>When every exorcist in the country swarms to this place?</b>

00:16:16.392 --> 00:16:18.145
<b>What is he talking about?</b>

00:16:18.227 --> 00:16:19.645
<b>Ms. Mi-dong.</b>

00:16:20.129 --> 00:16:21.745
<b>Snap out of it.</b>

00:16:22.164 --> 00:16:24.855
<b>She's not your friend. She's your job.</b>

00:16:29.071 --> 00:16:31.255
<b>Next time, I'll see you with your daughter,</b>

00:16:32.074 --> 00:16:33.655
<b>Cha Yu-ri.</b>

00:16:45.921 --> 00:16:47.845
<b>What does that mean?</b>

00:16:48.157 --> 00:16:49.990
<b>He's here to take Seo-woo?</b>

00:16:49.992 --> 00:16:52.045
<b>Why would shamans and exorcists swarm here?</b>

00:16:55.398 --> 00:16:56.685
<b>Ms. Mi-dong.</b>

00:16:58.701 --> 00:17:00.985
<b>Your daughter still sees ghosts.</b>

00:17:02.104 --> 00:17:03.355
<b>Yes.</b>

00:17:04.306 --> 00:17:06.695
<b>I got rid of all the local ghosts,</b>

00:17:06.842 --> 00:17:08.395
<b>but she still sees ghosts.</b>

00:17:08.878 --> 00:17:11.210
<b>Why would she see them when they are not around anymore?</b>

00:17:11.213 --> 00:17:13.295
<b>Well... That's...</b>

00:17:14.717 --> 00:17:16.310
<b>I don't know.</b>

00:17:16.318 --> 00:17:19.120
<b>Anyway, if your daughter keeps seeing ghosts like that,</b>

00:17:19.121 --> 00:17:21.805
<b>she will have to live like me or the exorcists you just met.</b>

00:17:22.024 --> 00:17:23.905
<b>No. Not a chance.</b>

00:17:25.661 --> 00:17:27.560
<b>Well...</b>

00:17:27.563 --> 00:17:30.845
<b>Maybe that's because she still has the energy of the local ghost.</b>

00:17:31.567 --> 00:17:33.400
<b>She won't see them in a few days.</b>

00:17:33.402 --> 00:17:37.325
<b>I'll make sure to keep ghosts away from her during my time here.</b>

00:17:39.575 --> 00:17:42.495
<b>Do you still not want to get your place back?</b>

00:17:48.684 --> 00:17:50.035
<b>No.</b>

00:17:51.487 --> 00:17:52.880
<b>I don't.</b>

00:17:52.888 --> 00:17:54.375
<b>Why not?</b>

00:17:55.057 --> 00:17:57.845
<b>Anyone else would do anything to get their place back.</b>

00:17:57.993 --> 00:18:01.045
<b>You have a chance to stay alive.</b>

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:08.685
<b>Do you know what Seo-woo likes the most?</b>

00:18:10.039 --> 00:18:11.455
<b>What is it?</b>

00:18:13.843 --> 00:18:15.295
<b>Her mom.</b>

00:18:19.782 --> 00:18:21.405
<b>Do you know</b>

00:18:21.784 --> 00:18:24.635
<b>when Seo-woo wears the broadest smile?</b>

00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:29.745
<b>When she runs to her mom.</b>

00:18:34.997 --> 00:18:37.090
<b>It's so pretty.</b>

00:18:37.099 --> 00:18:40.285
<b>This is your favorite princess doll.</b>

00:18:42.738 --> 00:18:44.255
<b>Mom.</b>

00:18:45.508 --> 00:18:46.925
<b>Mom?</b>

00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:49.210
<b>Do you like your mom?</b>

00:18:49.211 --> 00:18:51.395
<b>Mom is my favorite.</b>

00:18:52.114 --> 00:18:53.895
<b>Seo-woo.</b>

00:18:54.116 --> 00:18:55.810
<b>Mom!</b>

00:18:55.818 --> 00:18:57.735
<b>Seo-woo, are you all right?</b>

00:19:00.422 --> 00:19:02.845
<b>-Don't run. -Mom.</b>

00:19:03.492 --> 00:19:06.245
<b>I told you not to run. Are you all right?</b>

00:19:10.065 --> 00:19:12.915
<b>Seo-woo loves her mom so much.</b>

00:19:13.469 --> 00:19:16.425
<b>She can't live without her mom.</b>

00:19:17.773 --> 00:19:19.925
<b>I can't take that away from her.</b>

00:19:22.945 --> 00:19:24.595
<b>My gosh.</b>

00:19:25.614 --> 00:19:27.910
<b>I'll go. I'll disappear.</b>

00:19:27.917 --> 00:19:30.165
<b>Then Seo-woo will be fine, won't she?</b>

00:19:30.186 --> 00:19:31.380
<b>She won't have to see ghosts.</b>

00:19:31.387 --> 00:19:32.950
<b>I don't know that for sure.</b>

00:19:32.955 --> 00:19:35.375
<b>I'll go up there and beg.</b>

00:19:36.425 --> 00:19:38.445
<b>I don't have to be reincarnated.</b>

00:19:38.527 --> 00:19:40.115
<b>I'm willing to fall under.</b>

00:19:45.768 --> 00:19:47.925
<b>I was dead anyway.</b>

00:19:48.704 --> 00:19:50.355
<b>I have no regrets.</b>

00:19:52.107 --> 00:19:55.895
<b>Only those who can't give up anything have regrets.</b>

00:19:55.978 --> 00:19:57.825
<b>I've given up everything already.</b>

00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:00.295
<b>I have no regrets or lingering attachments.</b>

00:20:04.186 --> 00:20:05.675
<b>Fine.</b>

00:20:07.056 --> 00:20:08.475
<b>I get it.</b>

00:20:10.125 --> 00:20:13.475
<b>A mom can even kill herself if it's for her child.</b>

00:20:13.862 --> 00:20:16.045
<b>There's nothing that can stop you.</b>

00:20:19.034 --> 00:20:21.670
<b>Stay by your daughter and protect her</b>

00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:24.085
<b>until the 49th day.</b>

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:26.300
<b>That exorcist will be back.</b>

00:20:26.308 --> 00:20:29.525
<b>He will make your daughter live like us.</b>

00:20:30.379 --> 00:20:32.935
<b>There's no way it will happen.</b>

00:20:33.182 --> 00:20:35.205
<b>I will protect my daughter myself.</b>

00:20:40.256 --> 00:20:43.745
<b>Oh, right. Well...</b>

00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:47.545
<b>How did you make me stick to this earlier?</b>

00:20:48.998 --> 00:20:50.715
<b>I'm a human now.</b>

00:20:50.899 --> 00:20:52.255
<b>What?</b>

00:20:53.168 --> 00:20:54.230
<b>Well...</b>

00:20:54.236 --> 00:20:55.855
<b>It's not like</b>

00:20:56.071 --> 00:20:58.095
<b>you're a complete human.</b>

00:20:59.041 --> 00:21:01.025
<b>You're neither one nor the other.</b>

00:21:09.251 --> 00:21:11.435
<b>If you would do this,</b>

00:21:12.054 --> 00:21:14.475
<b>why did you send her in the first place?</b>

00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:30.400
<b>-Where's Yu-ri? -I guess she's in her room.</b>

00:21:30.406 --> 00:21:32.070
<b>-I'll go get her. -No.</b>

00:21:32.074 --> 00:21:33.795
<b>I'll go see her. I will.</b>

00:21:37.246 --> 00:21:38.765
<b>That exorcist?</b>

00:21:39.281 --> 00:21:41.665
<b>Don't you dare mess with my daughter.</b>

00:21:44.553 --> 00:21:45.975
<b>My baby.</b>

00:21:46.922 --> 00:21:48.090
<b>Mom.</b>

00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:49.290
<b>Come and have breakfast.</b>

00:21:49.291 --> 00:21:50.805
<b>Okay.</b>

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:13.595
<b>Yu-ri. Try some of this too.</b>

00:22:13.949 --> 00:22:15.450
<b>You like potatoes.</b>

00:22:15.451 --> 00:22:17.410
<b>She likes rolled omelets more.</b>

00:22:17.419 --> 00:22:19.650
<b>She likes potatoes too.</b>

00:22:19.655 --> 00:22:22.150
<b>I bought a lot of potatoes when you guys were young.</b>

00:22:22.157 --> 00:22:24.445
<b>You did? Did he do that?</b>

00:22:24.693 --> 00:22:25.720
<b>I like everything.</b>

00:22:25.728 --> 00:22:29.015
<b>I like potatoes and rolled omelets.</b>

00:22:29.698 --> 00:22:32.200
<b>She will eat what she wants to eat.</b>

00:22:32.201 --> 00:22:34.885
<b>Stop making a fuss and eat your food.</b>

00:22:35.137 --> 00:22:37.825
<b>She might feel too pressured to eat.</b>

00:22:38.173 --> 00:22:40.840
<b>Mom, don't you think you're being</b>

00:22:40.843 --> 00:22:43.865
<b>unfair to us with the soup to say that?</b>

00:22:51.053 --> 00:22:54.475
<b>Your dad and you have had a lot of it.</b>

00:22:55.891 --> 00:22:57.645
<b>Make sure to eat it all up.</b>

00:22:58.360 --> 00:22:59.575
<b>Okay.</b>

00:23:00.963 --> 00:23:03.485
<b>-Go ahead and eat. -Let's eat.</b>

00:23:17.913 --> 00:23:19.310
<b>Hang on.</b>

00:23:19.314 --> 00:23:22.210
<b>-No. -Let me say that again.</b>

00:23:22.217 --> 00:23:23.810
<b>-You can't. -Again.</b>

00:23:23.819 --> 00:23:25.735
<b>-Let's do this again. -Okay. Fine.</b>

00:23:27.523 --> 00:23:29.720
<b>-So you're... -Me?</b>

00:23:29.725 --> 00:23:32.760
<b>-...38 years old. -Right.</b>

00:23:32.761 --> 00:23:36.885
<b>-I'm 38. -And you're 44.</b>

00:23:37.099 --> 00:23:39.100
<b>Gosh, that's a lot.</b>

00:23:39.101 --> 00:23:41.230
<b>-Hey! -What are you talking about?</b>

00:23:41.236 --> 00:23:43.055
<b>Gosh, I can't believe this.</b>

00:23:43.405 --> 00:23:45.900
<b>This is why we shouldn't hang out with young girls.</b>

00:23:45.908 --> 00:23:47.570
<b>She's young and pretty.</b>

00:23:47.576 --> 00:23:49.410
<b>She's pretty, and she's even young.</b>

00:23:49.411 --> 00:23:51.240
<b>I really hate you.</b>

00:23:51.246 --> 00:23:54.410
<b>I just hate pretty girls.</b>

00:23:54.416 --> 00:23:57.565
<b>I will just call you by your names.</b>

00:23:58.987 --> 00:24:01.075
<b>-Whatever you want. -Hyeon-jeong.</b>

00:24:04.393 --> 00:24:06.145
<b>Do-yeon.</b>

00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:12.655
<b>This is nice. I got some friends.</b>

00:24:13.802 --> 00:24:15.100
<b>She said she left others out.</b>

00:24:15.103 --> 00:24:18.225
<b>Is this her first time to make real friends?</b>

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:20.600
<b>-Yes, you're right. -What did you say?</b>

00:24:20.609 --> 00:24:22.970
<b>She was like a voluntary outcast.</b>

00:24:22.978 --> 00:24:24.370
<b>Excuse me.</b>

00:24:24.379 --> 00:24:26.440
<b>You guys are having fun. Can I take a photo of you?</b>

00:24:26.448 --> 00:24:28.650
<b>-No. -Yes!</b>

00:24:28.650 --> 00:24:32.275
<b>-Let's do that. -One, two, and three.</b>

00:24:33.956 --> 00:24:35.650
<b>I bet it will look cool.</b>

00:24:35.657 --> 00:24:37.120
<b>Let me see.</b>

00:24:37.125 --> 00:24:38.820
<b>Let's see who looks prettiest here.</b>

00:24:38.827 --> 00:24:40.975
<b>Let me see.</b>

00:24:42.498 --> 00:24:44.685
<b>Gosh, there's nothing.</b>

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:46.615
<b>It's so strange.</b>

00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:50.170
<b>Nothing's on here.</b>

00:24:50.172 --> 00:24:51.485
<b>What's wrong with this?</b>

00:25:14.429 --> 00:25:18.015
<b>Seo-woo has been watching me.</b>

00:25:19.835 --> 00:25:21.055
<b>That's why...</b>

00:25:25.874 --> 00:25:28.395
<b>What was she looking at?</b>

00:25:56.138 --> 00:25:57.355
<b>Are you leaving?</b>

00:25:57.506 --> 00:25:58.695
<b>Yes.</b>

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:06.265
<b>We've become very close, right?</b>

00:26:07.215 --> 00:26:08.735
<b>I think so.</b>

00:26:10.652 --> 00:26:12.075
<b>Do you like it?</b>

00:26:12.888 --> 00:26:14.105
<b>Yes.</b>

00:26:14.523 --> 00:26:16.505
<b>I laugh a lot when I'm with them.</b>

00:26:18.627 --> 00:26:21.015
<b>-I'll see you later. -Gang-hwa.</b>

00:26:23.398 --> 00:26:25.285
<b>It might rain today.</b>

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:27.615
<b>I have one here.</b>

00:26:37.045 --> 00:26:39.635
<b>You need a bigger one not to get wet.</b>

00:26:41.049 --> 00:26:42.365
<b>I see.</b>

00:26:42.918 --> 00:26:44.235
<b>You're right.</b>

00:26:46.455 --> 00:26:48.250
<b>Don't look at me like that.</b>

00:26:48.256 --> 00:26:52.045
<b>I said I'd stop being considerate.</b>

00:26:53.095 --> 00:26:54.715
<b>This isn't being considerate?</b>

00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:58.315
<b>No. I'm just doing what I want to do.</b>

00:26:58.867 --> 00:27:00.430
<b>And you shouldn't be considerate of me.</b>

00:27:00.435 --> 00:27:03.125
<b>I wasn't so considerate in the first place.</b>

00:27:03.772 --> 00:27:05.295
<b>See you.</b>

00:27:11.947 --> 00:27:12.910
<b>Min-jeong.</b>

00:27:12.914 --> 00:27:14.235
<b>Yes?</b>

00:27:15.951 --> 00:27:17.135
<b>Let's</b>

00:27:21.156 --> 00:27:22.675
<b>get a new pick-up helper.</b>

00:27:32.701 --> 00:27:36.025
<b>You darn exorcist. You'd better stay away from us.</b>

00:27:40.542 --> 00:27:41.895
<b>Good.</b>

00:27:47.149 --> 00:27:48.735
<b>Seo-woo.</b>

00:27:49.451 --> 00:27:52.420
<b>What are you doing here at this hour?</b>

00:27:52.421 --> 00:27:55.920
<b>I was out taking a walk.</b>

00:27:55.924 --> 00:27:58.620
<b>I happened to be passing by, so I thought I'd walk with you.</b>

00:27:58.627 --> 00:28:00.675
<b>Okay. Come with us.</b>

00:28:01.196 --> 00:28:03.915
<b>Let's go Seo-woo.</b>

00:28:10.706 --> 00:28:12.870
<b>Seo-woo, you look even prettier today.</b>

00:28:12.874 --> 00:28:15.270
<b>I don't think you like all kids.</b>

00:28:15.277 --> 00:28:16.610
<b>What?</b>

00:28:16.611 --> 00:28:18.110
<b>You care only for Seo-woo.</b>

00:28:18.113 --> 00:28:20.140
<b>Oh, well...</b>

00:28:20.148 --> 00:28:22.605
<b>I do like many kids.</b>

00:28:22.751 --> 00:28:25.675
<b>Seo-woo is just adorable.</b>

00:28:28.890 --> 00:28:31.205
<b>Isn't it that you want to be a mom?</b>

00:28:32.661 --> 00:28:35.060
<b>What? Mom?</b>

00:28:35.063 --> 00:28:37.115
<b>Why are you so surprised?</b>

00:28:37.265 --> 00:28:39.900
<b>If you like a kid of her age,</b>

00:28:39.901 --> 00:28:41.515
<b>it means you want to get married.</b>

00:28:42.437 --> 00:28:44.600
<b>Oh, I see.</b>

00:28:44.606 --> 00:28:46.925
<b>You're not married yet.</b>

00:28:48.577 --> 00:28:50.095
<b>Yu-ri.</b>

00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:00.975
<b>Seo-woo, it's okay.</b>

00:29:01.189 --> 00:29:02.805
<b>It's been fine these days.</b>

00:29:06.728 --> 00:29:08.245
<b>Are you all right?</b>

00:29:09.431 --> 00:29:11.330
<b>It's strange,</b>

00:29:11.333 --> 00:29:14.285
<b>but dogs used to bark at Seo-woo until not long ago.</b>

00:29:17.739 --> 00:29:19.640
<b>Stop it. Seo-woo is terrified.</b>

00:29:19.641 --> 00:29:21.355
<b>Go away!</b>

00:29:21.610 --> 00:29:23.825
<b>Stay quiet! My gosh.</b>

00:29:24.513 --> 00:29:25.965
<b>Stop!</b>

00:29:29.851 --> 00:29:31.975
<b>But that doesn't happen anymore.</b>

00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:34.335
<b>Is it because she got bigger?</b>

00:29:45.033 --> 00:29:49.030
<b>I just realized something amazing, Dad.</b>

00:29:49.037 --> 00:29:51.525
<b>Something amazing? What?</b>

00:29:52.174 --> 00:29:55.525
<b>Popo is a genius dog.</b>

00:29:56.511 --> 00:29:58.140
<b>-All of a sudden? -Think about it.</b>

00:29:58.146 --> 00:30:00.210
<b>It barks at everyone but our family.</b>

00:30:00.215 --> 00:30:03.605
<b>It even barks at the delivery guy who comes every day.</b>

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:08.645
<b>But it didn't bark at Yu-ri even once.</b>

00:30:09.691 --> 00:30:11.245
<b>You're right.</b>

00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:13.975
<b>Come to think of it,</b>

00:30:14.062 --> 00:30:16.990
<b>we brought Popo after Yu-ri left. Popo didn't see her before.</b>

00:30:16.998 --> 00:30:18.830
<b>My point.</b>

00:30:18.834 --> 00:30:21.485
<b>It knows that she's our family.</b>

00:30:21.770 --> 00:30:24.870
<b>Isn't it genius? Do you think it should be on TV?</b>

00:30:24.873 --> 00:30:26.755
<b>-Make a call. -Okay.</b>

00:30:27.976 --> 00:30:30.065
<b>It's unbelievable.</b>

00:31:22.497 --> 00:31:23.945
<b>Honey.</b>

00:31:26.601 --> 00:31:28.385
<b>About Yu-ri.</b>

00:31:29.337 --> 00:31:33.455
<b>Don't you think she needs to see Seo-woo once?</b>

00:31:36.945 --> 00:31:39.610
<b>Don't worry. She's been seeing Seo-woo already.</b>

00:31:39.614 --> 00:31:41.780
<b>Did she see her? When?</b>

00:31:41.783 --> 00:31:43.805
<b>Did Gang-hwa let her meet Seo-woo?</b>

00:31:46.021 --> 00:31:47.805
<b>I'm glad to hear that.</b>

00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:50.505
<b>No.</b>

00:31:51.293 --> 00:31:53.345
<b>Is it a good thing?</b>

00:31:57.265 --> 00:32:01.355
<b>She must've been devastated to see Seo-woo.</b>

00:32:04.005 --> 00:32:05.770
<b>Now that Yu-ri's back,</b>

00:32:05.774 --> 00:32:07.600
<b>don't you think we should bring Seo-woo back?</b>

00:32:07.609 --> 00:32:10.195
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

00:32:10.278 --> 00:32:12.880
<b>It's not like she's a thing. Why would we bring her back?</b>

00:32:12.881 --> 00:32:16.910
<b>I mean, Dad and you want to see her too.</b>

00:32:16.918 --> 00:32:18.065
<b>Forget it.</b>

00:32:18.186 --> 00:32:20.280
<b>I can't tell a six-year-old kid</b>

00:32:20.288 --> 00:32:23.345
<b>that Yu-ri is her real mom just because of my greed.</b>

00:32:25.026 --> 00:32:28.275
<b>There is no end to the greed of people.</b>

00:32:33.168 --> 00:32:35.825
<b>I know she misses Seo-woo too.</b>

00:32:40.041 --> 00:32:42.010
<b>I'll walk fast and get there before you.</b>

00:32:42.010 --> 00:32:43.940
<b>I'll win. I'll be the winner.</b>

00:32:43.945 --> 00:32:45.640
<b>I'm winning.</b>

<b>-Hyeon-jeong. -Hyeon-jeong.</b>

00:32:52.354 --> 00:32:54.520
<b>-Hello, Seo-woo. -You were like this earlier.</b>

00:32:54.522 --> 00:32:57.150
<b>It sounds like you've never called your friend before.</b>

00:32:57.158 --> 00:32:58.820
<b>It sounds really awkward.</b>

00:32:58.827 --> 00:33:00.190
<b>What did I do?</b>

00:33:00.195 --> 00:33:03.390
<b>Hyeon-jeong. It's not awkward at all.</b>

00:33:03.398 --> 00:33:06.500
<b>Hyeon-jeong, let's just go.</b>

00:33:06.501 --> 00:33:08.330
<b>-Okay. Let's go. -Okay.</b>

00:33:08.336 --> 00:33:10.025
<b>-Let's go, Min-jeong. -Okay.</b>

00:33:10.905 --> 00:33:13.455
<b>It did sound awkward though.</b>

00:33:14.743 --> 00:33:16.465
<b>Okay.</b>

00:33:16.745 --> 00:33:19.080
<b>-This is all your fault. -What did I do?</b>

00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:21.240
<b>Now I understand</b>

00:33:21.249 --> 00:33:23.365
<b>a stray cat that lost a fight.</b>

00:33:23.585 --> 00:33:25.780
<b>-Hey. -Why would you take it out on me?</b>

00:33:25.787 --> 00:33:29.005
<b>I don't know. Let's just go.</b>

00:33:37.899 --> 00:33:40.055
<b>It's really strange.</b>

00:33:40.068 --> 00:33:42.070
<b>How did Yu-ri know that?</b>

00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:43.825
<b>I don't know.</b>

00:33:43.938 --> 00:33:45.640
<b>She said she just got the feeling.</b>

00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:48.370
<b>Feeling? What feeling? Is she a detective or what?</b>

00:33:48.376 --> 00:33:51.880
<b>What could she feel? Even a doctor wouldn't know that without a closer look.</b>

00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:53.635
<b>My point.</b>

00:33:54.716 --> 00:33:56.810
<b>I'm sure she's hiding something.</b>

00:33:56.818 --> 00:33:59.180
<b>Everything is so strange.</b>

00:33:59.187 --> 00:34:01.450
<b>You knew all along that she was strange.</b>

00:34:01.456 --> 00:34:04.120
<b>It was strange that Yu-ri asked you to stay quiet for 49 days.</b>

00:34:04.125 --> 00:34:06.915
<b>And it was strange that she knew about Min-jeong.</b>

00:34:09.297 --> 00:34:10.915
<b>Don't sigh.</b>

00:34:10.965 --> 00:34:12.730
<b>Please stop sighing.</b>

00:34:12.734 --> 00:34:15.530
<b>I didn't sleep a wink because of that sigh.</b>

00:34:15.537 --> 00:34:17.085
<b>Why?</b>

00:34:17.405 --> 00:34:20.555
<b>Is it about Hyeon-jeong? Hey, did she say anything?</b>

00:34:20.775 --> 00:34:22.265
<b>Hey.</b>

00:34:22.744 --> 00:34:24.995
<b>Hyeon-jeong didn't say anything.</b>

00:34:25.613 --> 00:34:27.135
<b>But...</b>

00:34:28.049 --> 00:34:30.635
<b>-I just think... -Think what?</b>

00:34:33.288 --> 00:34:34.280
<b>I think she's crazy.</b>

00:34:34.289 --> 00:34:35.475
<b><i>She has to live.</i></b>

00:34:41.529 --> 00:34:42.845
<b>That's right.</b>

00:34:43.431 --> 00:34:44.660
<b>She can live, so she should.</b>

00:34:44.666 --> 00:34:47.285
<b>She has to live. I'm going to save her.</b>

00:34:48.103 --> 00:34:52.195
<b>Gosh, but they love each other.</b>

00:34:52.507 --> 00:34:55.025
<b>She's not getting divorced.</b>

00:34:57.645 --> 00:34:59.480
<b>I was out of my mind.</b>

00:34:59.481 --> 00:35:00.840
<b>Why did I do that?</b>

00:35:00.849 --> 00:35:02.865
<b>But I didn't know</b>

00:35:03.184 --> 00:35:04.835
<b>this would happen.</b>

00:35:05.687 --> 00:35:07.150
<b>No. But she still has to live.</b>

00:35:07.155 --> 00:35:08.875
<b>I'll make them divorce.</b>

00:35:10.625 --> 00:35:12.105
<b>Then</b>

00:35:12.627 --> 00:35:14.575
<b>what about the kid?</b>

00:35:23.171 --> 00:35:24.470
<b><i>Right. That's the word.</i></b>

00:35:24.472 --> 00:35:25.540
<b>I'm sure she's crazy.</b>

00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:27.355
<b>Didn't she say anything?</b>

00:35:27.775 --> 00:35:30.725
<b>She seems to know something.</b>

00:35:30.812 --> 00:35:33.080
<b>But she stopped talking about Yu-ri at some point.</b>

00:35:33.081 --> 00:35:34.565
<b>She just keeps sighing.</b>

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:06.935
<b>My goodness.</b>

00:36:07.182 --> 00:36:09.050
<b>Are you being chased or what?</b>

00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:11.435
<b>-Why are you walking so fast? -What?</b>

00:36:11.553 --> 00:36:14.075
<b>-Was it you guys? -What's wrong?</b>

00:36:14.989 --> 00:36:17.245
<b>Gosh, you startled me.</b>

00:36:17.425 --> 00:36:19.120
<b>Her name? Are you insane?</b>

00:36:19.127 --> 00:36:21.860
<b>Why would I callout her name around Seo-woo?</b>

00:36:21.863 --> 00:36:23.045
<b>You're right.</b>

00:36:23.231 --> 00:36:24.915
<b>I knew you didn't.</b>

00:36:25.934 --> 00:36:28.285
<b>-Why? -The thing is,</b>

00:36:28.369 --> 00:36:31.400
<b>Seo-woo knows Yu-ri's name. She said Cha Yu-ri.</b>

00:36:31.406 --> 00:36:32.995
<b>Isn't it strange?</b>

00:36:33.107 --> 00:36:35.765
<b>I'm sure she's hiding something.</b>

00:36:38.613 --> 00:36:40.235
<b>Everything is so strange.</b>

00:36:42.517 --> 00:36:44.435
<b>What's strange?</b>

00:36:47.222 --> 00:36:49.390
<b>At first, I just thought</b>

00:36:49.390 --> 00:36:52.760
<b>she found out about my marriage or Min-jeong somehow.</b>

00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:54.775
<b>But come to think of it,</b>

00:36:55.096 --> 00:36:57.785
<b>she wasn't even surprised when she saw me for the first time.</b>

00:36:57.865 --> 00:36:59.485
<b>She just</b>

00:37:00.668 --> 00:37:03.125
<b>looked as if she got caught.</b>

00:37:11.045 --> 00:37:14.095
<b>I don't know. It's all strange.</b>

00:37:22.156 --> 00:37:23.675

<b>I can tell she knows something.</b>

00:37:28.162 --> 00:37:30.545

00:39:10.898 --> 00:39:12.660
<b>There are a lot of abductors these days.</b>

00:39:12.667 --> 00:39:14.230
<b>They are dressed in black.</b>

00:39:14.235 --> 00:39:18.955
<b>And they kidnap kids of Seo-woo's age. Make sure to carry them around with you.</b>

00:39:19.807 --> 00:39:21.095
<b>Okay.</b>

00:39:42.330 --> 00:39:43.815
<b>All right.</b>

00:39:44.465 --> 00:39:46.855
<b>All your classes are over now.</b>

<b>You are the best.</b>

00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:54.200
<b>Seo-woo, do you have fun in the classes?</b>

00:39:54.208 --> 00:39:55.555
<b>Yes.</b>

00:39:57.412 --> 00:39:58.995
<b>I'm glad to hear that.</b>

00:40:12.593 --> 00:40:15.815
<b>You know who I am, right?</b>

00:40:16.998 --> 00:40:20.915
<b>You've seen me the whole time, right?</b>

00:40:21.135 --> 00:40:22.485
<b>Yes.</b>

00:40:31.746 --> 00:40:33.635
<b>I had no idea.</b>

00:40:36.417 --> 00:40:38.705
<b>I've been with you all along.</b>

00:40:40.955 --> 00:40:43.005
<b>You must've been terrified.</b>

00:40:46.127 --> 00:40:47.545
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

00:41:51.359 --> 00:41:52.715
<b>Gang-hwa?</b>

<b>What are you doing here?</b>

00:41:58.766 --> 00:42:00.885
<b>I was passing by.</b>

<b>Raise your head and keep your shoulders back.</b>

00:42:09.877 --> 00:42:11.570
<b>You didn't do anything wrong.</b>

<b>Just be a man.</b>

00:42:15.249 --> 00:42:17.735
<b>I'm totally lost.</b>

<b>We'll live our lives.</b>

<b>You being like this</b>

<b>makes us feel bad about Yu-ri coming back.</b>

00:42:42.443 --> 00:42:44.125
<b>So</b>

00:42:45.046 --> 00:42:47.095
<b>brazen it out,</b>

00:42:48.482 --> 00:42:49.835

<b>I'm grateful to your wife as well.</b>

<b>Yes?</b>

<b>Why don't you quit</b>

<b>Still,</b>

<b>Just tell Gang-hwa's wife the truth</b>

<b>and ask her to let you see Seo-woo from time to time.</b>

<b>I can't do that, Mom.</b>

<b>I missed you a lot more.</b>

<b>Where is Hye-jin, by the way?</b>

<b>Since she killed herself,</b>

<b>Why did you kill yourself?</b>

<b>I was bullied.</b>

<b><i>It was my dream since childhood</i></b>

<b>Do you have a second?</b>

<b>Are we idiots?</b>

<b>Should I eat it then?</b>

00:52:59.359 --> 00:53:01.775
<b>You don't like tangerines?</b>

<b>-Eat more apples. -Yes.</b>

00:53:05.966 --> 00:53:07.785
<b>Do you want to finish this?</b>

00:53:10.070 --> 00:53:12.985
<b>It seems like you don't like tangerines.</b>

00:53:13.473 --> 00:53:15.900
<b>You don't want any tangerines? Should Auntie eat all of them?</b>

<b>You can't give her such a big piece.</b>

00:53:17.911 --> 00:53:19.465
<b>I'll eat it.</b>

00:53:30.090 --> 00:53:32.390

<b>Why would "T, Y" be a swear word?</b>

00:53:58.852 --> 00:54:00.605
<b>What does it mean?</b>

00:54:01.321 --> 00:54:03.605

<b>I'm not cheating on my wife, but I'm still lying to her. Gosh.</b>

<b>You're not cheating on anyone.</b>

<b>Oh.</b>

00:54:53.740 --> 00:54:55.695
<b>How did you get into medical school?</b>

<b>-See you. -Bye.</b>

00:55:13.193 --> 00:55:15.345
<b>You're so excited. Are you happy?</b>

00:55:16.763 --> 00:55:18.830
<b>You went grocery shopping?</b>

00:55:18.832 --> 00:55:22.100
<b>Yes. What is Ha-jun doing here?</b>

00:55:22.102 --> 00:55:24.585
<b>What? Well...</b>

00:55:24.738 --> 00:55:27.370
<b>He's been clinging to me all day.</b>

00:55:27.374 --> 00:55:28.740
<b>Is Seo-woo at home?</b>

00:55:28.742 --> 00:55:30.265
<b>Pardon?</b>

00:55:30.777 --> 00:55:33.225
<b>Well, yes.</b>

00:55:35.082 --> 00:55:36.180
<b>Seo-woo, sit here.</b>

00:55:36.183 --> 00:55:37.710
<b>Why don't you pack a lunch?</b>

00:55:37.718 --> 00:55:39.865
<b>Are you going to eat out?</b>

00:55:39.886 --> 00:55:41.080
<b>Well, don't worry.</b>

00:55:41.088 --> 00:55:44.705
<b>Geun-sang is packing lunch for us too.</b>

00:55:45.859 --> 00:55:49.275
<b>Seo-woo, you must be excited to spend the day with Ha-jun.</b>

<b>Next time, let's all go together.</b>

00:55:52.632 --> 00:55:54.155
<b>What?</b>

00:55:54.568 --> 00:55:57.085
<b>With Ha-jun's family, the six of us.</b>

00:55:57.571 --> 00:56:00.325
<b>Sure, let's do that.</b>

00:56:37.611 --> 00:56:38.925
<b>YU-RI</b>

00:56:41.114 --> 00:56:42.435
<b>Hi, Yu-ri.</b>

00:56:48.088 --> 00:56:50.345
<b>Daddy is here, Seo-woo.</b>

00:56:52.826 --> 00:56:55.045
<b>Hi, Seo-woo. Did you have fun?</b>

00:56:56.897 --> 00:56:59.045
<b>She could have stayed longer.</b>

00:56:59.332 --> 00:57:01.055
<b>No, we're fine.</b>

00:57:01.067 --> 00:57:03.155
<b>Min-jeong must be waiting.</b>

00:57:06.273 --> 00:57:07.755
<b>How are your parents?</b>

00:57:08.008 --> 00:57:10.625
<b>They're happy. Very happy.</b>

00:57:13.180 --> 00:57:14.865
<b>That's good.</b>

00:57:15.215 --> 00:57:16.695
<b>That's really good.</b>

00:57:19.553 --> 00:57:22.335
<b>Seo-woo, let's go home now.</b>

00:57:24.891 --> 00:57:27.120
<b>Well. Don't stop by anywhere.</b>

00:57:27.127 --> 00:57:28.160
<b>Go straight home.</b>

00:57:28.161 --> 00:57:31.215
<b>Hold Seo-woo's hand at all times. Be careful.</b>

00:57:31.298 --> 00:57:32.485
<b>Okay?</b>

00:57:33.467 --> 00:57:36.055
<b>Sure, of course.</b>

00:57:38.071 --> 00:57:39.425
<b>It's cold. Go inside.</b>

00:57:39.673 --> 00:57:42.055
<b>-Okay. -Let's go, Seo-woo.</b>

00:57:47.214 --> 00:57:48.795
<b>Gang-hwa.</b>

00:57:54.054 --> 00:57:55.605
<b>Thank you.</b>

00:59:17.170 --> 00:59:19.025
<b><i>Where are you?</i></b>

00:59:19.906 --> 00:59:22.755
<b>MIN-JEONG</b>

<b>Seo-woo.</b>

00:59:51.237 --> 00:59:52.855
<b>Who are you?</b>

01:00:01.715 --> 01:00:03.365
<b>I said, who are you?</b>

01:00:08.021 --> 01:00:10.035
<b>I'm Yu-ri's friend.</b>

01:00:13.293 --> 01:00:14.645
<b>What?</b>

01:00:22.736 --> 01:00:25.400
<b>You woke up, and you were at a charnel house?</b>

01:00:25.405 --> 01:00:27.840
<b>I remember that I died.</b>

01:00:27.841 --> 01:00:30.040
<b>But I woke up, and it's the present.</b>

01:00:30.043 --> 01:00:33.010
<b>She says I'm nice. Isn't that weird?</b>

01:00:33.013 --> 01:00:35.080
<b>Yu-ri said that? How would she know?</b>

01:00:35.081 --> 01:00:37.110
<b>It's not easy to know that if you aren't close.</b>

01:00:37.117 --> 01:00:41.235
<b>But I feel like Yu-ri have known Min-jeong for a long time.</b>

01:00:41.788 --> 01:00:43.435
<b>Is it just me?</b>

01:00:46.493 --> 01:00:48.345
<b>You don't know who Cha Yu-ri is?</b>

01:00:50.797 --> 01:00:53.755
<b>She's been following you and your kid around.</b>

01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:55.455
<b>She's a ghost.</b>

01:00:57.437 --> 01:00:59.430
<b>-What? -For</b>

01:00:59.439 --> 01:01:01.295
<b>five whole years.</b>

01:01:01.808 --> 01:01:03.355
<b>Creepy, right?</b>

01:01:13.119 --> 01:01:15.405
<b><i>A ghost?</i></b>

01:01:15.955 --> 01:01:17.645
<b>Yu-ri has been a ghost</b>

<b>And she's been following Gang-hwa around?</b>

01:01:21.261 --> 01:01:22.615
<b>Yes.</b>

01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:28.315
<b>Are you crazy?</b>

01:01:28.468 --> 01:01:31.285
<b>Why didn't you tell me earlier?</b>

01:01:32.072 --> 01:01:34.155
<b>I found out only recently.</b>

01:01:38.878 --> 01:01:40.765
<b>My gosh.</b>

01:01:41.748 --> 01:01:43.765
<b>If Gang-hwa finds out,</b>

01:01:46.319 --> 01:01:49.275
<b>how is he going to handle it?</b>

01:02:02.235 --> 01:02:03.785
<b>What's wrong?</b>

01:02:04.804 --> 01:02:06.685
<b>What's the matter, Gang-hwa?</b>

01:02:11.444 --> 01:02:13.165
<b>Did something happen?</b>

01:02:14.848 --> 01:02:16.195
