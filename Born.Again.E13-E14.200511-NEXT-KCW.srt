1
00:00:06,771 --> 00:00:10,909
(Year 2000)

2
00:00:19,284 --> 00:00:20,919
(Episode 13)

3
00:00:29,455 --> 00:00:30,491
Dad

4
00:00:30,493 --> 00:00:33,737
isn't Park Do Seong the killer
of the milk-delivery girl?

5
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:36,261
You'll give him a life sentence,
won't you?

6
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:42,794
Didn't you say you wanted to be
a judge like me, son?

7
00:00:43,322 --> 00:00:44,309
Yes.

8
00:00:47,832 --> 00:00:49,948
This is dripped for 12 hours...

9
00:00:49,948 --> 00:00:52,017
to become coffee.

10
00:00:52,683 --> 00:00:54,653
A judge has to be slow to make
a decision.

11
00:00:54,794 --> 00:00:56,520
"Is the defendant really
a criminal?"

12
00:00:57,512 --> 00:00:59,691
"Does the punishment suit
the defendant?"

13
00:01:00,379 --> 00:01:03,441
"Would it be unfair to his
or her life in any way?"

14
00:01:06,379 --> 00:01:10,135
This is not the business of beasts,
but humans.

15
00:01:10,228 --> 00:01:13,371
What if Park Do Seong kills someone
else after he's released?

16
00:01:13,416 --> 00:01:17,409
I saw the way he looked at me
at the trial.

17
00:01:24,373 --> 00:01:28,291
(The damage and pain caused by
the defendant are irrevocable.)

18
00:01:28,293 --> 00:01:29,518
(The defendant is sentenced
to four years in prison.)

19
00:01:32,652 --> 00:01:33,603
Dad.

20
00:01:34,693 --> 00:01:36,127
At 2 a.m. this morning,

21
00:01:36,152 --> 00:01:37,957
the culprit of
the milk-delivery murder case...

22
00:01:37,982 --> 00:01:40,398
Mr. Park visited the house
of Mr. Choi, age 78...

23
00:01:40,543 --> 00:01:43,668
who lives at Sillim-dong
right after his release.

24
00:01:44,379 --> 00:01:47,405
Mr. Park killed Mr. Choi,
a 78-year-old who gave...

25
00:01:47,405 --> 00:01:48,940
eyewitness testimony four years ago,

26
00:01:49,168 --> 00:01:52,110
and Lee, his granddaughter,
by bludgeoning,

27
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,012
then set fire at Mr. Choi's house.

28
00:01:54,679 --> 00:01:56,948
His granddaughter Lee was
a three-month-old baby,

29
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:00,352
and Mr. Park testified he killed
her because she was crying too loud,

30
00:02:00,352 --> 00:02:01,686
which provoked outrage
from the public.

31
00:02:01,748 --> 00:02:04,422
Moreover, Mr. Park was decided
as unfit...

32
00:02:04,422 --> 00:02:08,193
due to his personality disorder
and alcohol dependence...

33
00:02:08,317 --> 00:02:11,162
and sentenced to four years
in prison.

34
00:02:11,162 --> 00:02:13,865
There is public uproar against...

35
00:02:13,865 --> 00:02:16,234
Judge Kim Hyeong Suk, the judge
in charge.

36
00:02:16,262 --> 00:02:19,604
Being unfit is when someone is
unable to distinguish objects...

37
00:02:19,771 --> 00:02:22,774
or is unable to make
his or her own decision.

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,377
Park had been receiving hospital
treatment for alcoholism...

39
00:02:25,449 --> 00:02:28,146
for three months
before he'd committed the crime...

40
00:02:28,171 --> 00:02:31,082
and was decided as unfit.

41
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:35,289
This was not the business of humans,
but beasts.

42
00:02:36,019 --> 00:02:39,310
Dad should not have given him
a chance...

43
00:02:40,496 --> 00:02:42,160
to that beast.

44
00:02:42,185 --> 00:02:44,829
(The path of humans.
The path of beasts.)

45
00:02:58,973 --> 00:03:01,446
How could you still smile like that?

46
00:03:03,012 --> 00:03:04,616
I'm alive now...

47
00:03:06,988 --> 00:03:08,686
and I can't forgive him.

48
00:03:13,564 --> 00:03:14,759
("Resurrection" by Tolstoy)

49
00:03:47,707 --> 00:03:49,074
A polaroid photo?

50
00:03:58,004 --> 00:04:01,639
You take immunosuppressant,
but don't care about weak immunity.

51
00:04:03,293 --> 00:04:04,856
The cut is festering.

52
00:04:05,832 --> 00:04:07,324
It's swollen and has heat.

53
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:09,707
You didn't take antibiotics,
did you?

54
00:04:11,043 --> 00:04:12,383
Well, I don't think this is
something...

55
00:04:12,383 --> 00:04:15,820
a professor should hear
from her student in medical school.

56
00:04:18,183 --> 00:04:20,183
You're good at noticing the damage
of someone else.

57
00:04:20,496 --> 00:04:22,496
But you don't seem to be good
at noticing your own.

58
00:04:25,309 --> 00:04:27,309
The cut might become a scar.

59
00:04:28,152 --> 00:04:30,201
You have to disinfect it at least
once a week.

60
00:04:32,457 --> 00:04:34,239
Apply this three times a day.

61
00:04:36,816 --> 00:04:39,277
Eat this twice a day.

62
00:04:39,441 --> 00:04:40,784
Don't forget to take it.

63
00:04:49,644 --> 00:04:50,995
It's a snowy field.

64
00:04:51,641 --> 00:04:54,621
Why are there only two men in it?

65
00:04:54,646 --> 00:04:57,854
I found paintings of the old
testament by James Tissot memorable.

66
00:04:58,746 --> 00:05:00,798
- It's Cain and Abel.
- I see.

67
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:03,468
I guess you get inspiration
from the bible as well.

68
00:05:03,514 --> 00:05:05,537
I was just curious growing up.

69
00:05:05,901 --> 00:05:08,006
My grandfather used to be a pastor,

70
00:05:08,644 --> 00:05:10,475
and I would annoy him by asking
so many questions.

71
00:05:11,059 --> 00:05:13,902
Why did the lord abandon Cain...

72
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:15,995
and pick Abel?

73
00:05:19,081 --> 00:05:21,473
Cain became the first murderer
of the humankind.

74
00:05:45,191 --> 00:05:47,011
How scared would he have been?

75
00:05:48,612 --> 00:05:50,648
He would've regretted it
after committing murder.

76
00:05:51,145 --> 00:05:53,751
His father did not abandon him,

77
00:05:54,013 --> 00:05:58,681
and he would've realized
that he loved his brother too,

78
00:05:59,589 --> 00:06:02,519
- at the moment he killed him.
- You are concerned...

79
00:06:04,301 --> 00:06:06,043
about the murderer, not the victim?

80
00:06:08,106 --> 00:06:09,934
Regret is a painful emotion.

81
00:06:12,762 --> 00:06:15,191
Sometimes the feeling of longing,
sorry, and sadness...

82
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:18,576
surge up at the same time.

83
00:06:20,456 --> 00:06:21,870
Regret is an emotion...

84
00:06:22,521 --> 00:06:24,754
that a person can feel...

85
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:26,951
only for the one he or she loves.

86
00:06:28,738 --> 00:06:32,332
I wanted to know everything...

87
00:06:33,573 --> 00:06:34,878
about this woman.

88
00:06:40,356 --> 00:06:43,935
Could I have the sushi roll I tried
last time?

89
00:06:43,935 --> 00:06:46,037
Of course, you can...

90
00:06:46,037 --> 00:06:47,863
since you're Sa Bin's student.

91
00:06:47,863 --> 00:06:50,408
You can sit right there.

92
00:06:50,501 --> 00:06:53,745
I'll make one for you quickly.

93
00:07:03,667 --> 00:07:05,902
I read an article that Professor
Jung implanted the heart...

94
00:07:06,691 --> 00:07:08,540
- of a death-row convict.
- Well,

95
00:07:08,542 --> 00:07:10,637
there was this death-row convict
called Kim Sa Yeon...

96
00:07:10,637 --> 00:07:13,898
who killed his wife and kid.

97
00:07:14,207 --> 00:07:18,356
But Kim Sa Yeon hanged himself
in jail.

98
00:07:18,381 --> 00:07:22,240
Sa Bin's father saved this man
several times.

99
00:07:22,566 --> 00:07:25,777
That's how he came to decide
to donate his heart to Sa Bin.

100
00:07:26,111 --> 00:07:28,246
Before Kim Sa Yeon donated
his heart,

101
00:07:28,246 --> 00:07:30,246
he met Sa Bin once.

102
00:07:30,621 --> 00:07:32,073
And he's said to have cried
so much...

103
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,194
as he regretted it. Amen.

104
00:07:35,219 --> 00:07:38,923
The blood in your hands
after you kill your family...

105
00:07:39,551 --> 00:07:42,879
can never be washed away.

106
00:07:42,904 --> 00:07:45,865
Well, I think you'd know that
better than anyone, don't you?

107
00:07:46,127 --> 00:07:47,457
You went around looking
everywhere...

108
00:07:47,482 --> 00:07:50,768
for your wife who had an affair,
holding your raw fish knife.

109
00:07:50,856 --> 00:07:52,172
You jerk!

110
00:07:52,257 --> 00:07:55,239
Is that how you cut an apple?
Give it to me.

111
00:07:57,058 --> 00:08:00,912
That's why I boiled
Sa Bin's milk bottle,

112
00:08:01,012 --> 00:08:04,882
changed her diapers,
and worked hard.

113
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:08,395
That's not a big deal.
When Sa Bin went to school...

114
00:08:08,395 --> 00:08:11,989
I helped sort out traffic at school
wearing green clothes...

115
00:08:11,989 --> 00:08:15,393
and attended career counseling.

116
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:17,598
You jerk,

117
00:08:17,623 --> 00:08:20,031
you act as a religious leader
among a group of women.

118
00:08:20,056 --> 00:08:22,793
Did you throw the bull
with your sly mouth?

119
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:23,879
A sly mouth?

120
00:08:24,391 --> 00:08:27,472
Right, I'd sell a nation as well as
my soul.

121
00:08:27,497 --> 00:08:30,975
What is there I can't sell?
I need money so Sa Bin's dad...

122
00:08:31,582 --> 00:08:33,444
could stay at a comfortable
long-term care hospital.

123
00:08:34,566 --> 00:08:35,845
And what about Sa Bin?

124
00:08:35,847 --> 00:08:41,352
I can't sleep when I think about
when her heart might fail her.

125
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:43,902
But what could I do?

126
00:08:45,232 --> 00:08:48,359
Do you have money?
You don't have a dime.

127
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:52,910
I have money. How much do you want?
20 dollars?

128
00:08:53,523 --> 00:08:56,033
I couldn't even pay your monthly
wage. You have no money.

129
00:09:07,044 --> 00:09:10,915
(Body heat)

130
00:09:20,404 --> 00:09:21,980
(Human remains in museums)

131
00:09:31,493 --> 00:09:33,037
(Donggang mummy)

132
00:09:41,078 --> 00:09:44,949
My friend is a talented graphic
designer who restores the remains.

133
00:09:46,918 --> 00:09:48,786

134
00:10:08,737 --> 00:10:10,204
(New post is uploaded.)

135
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:17,037
It's weekend and the bone maniac is
going to the NFS after lunch.

136
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:18,643
When are you planning to hang
out with me?

137
00:10:33,537 --> 00:10:34,637
What are you looking for?

138
00:10:34,704 --> 00:10:37,904
I was hoping it wasn't true.
But my diary...

139
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:40,835
is really not here.

140
00:10:40,837 --> 00:10:43,770
Your diary? The 14th item on your
list of outdated items?

141
00:10:43,837 --> 00:10:47,870
I've looked everywhere from
university to my dad's shop.

142
00:10:47,872 --> 00:10:51,008
Is your credit card in there?

143
00:10:51,237 --> 00:10:54,002
No one would have taken that
cheap thing.

144
00:10:54,004 --> 00:10:56,354
Just relax. Someone will
find it for you.

145
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:58,809
I feel like
I'm being dissected alive...

146
00:10:58,811 --> 00:11:00,759
when I picture someone reading it.

147
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:05,370
Oh, my.

148
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,904
- Hello?
- Can I look at corpses today?

149
00:11:12,504 --> 00:11:13,316
Corpses?

150
00:11:13,318 --> 00:11:16,207
You said I could have
three visits to NFS.

151
00:11:16,504 --> 00:11:19,810
- I think today's good.
- Today?

152
00:11:21,204 --> 00:11:25,570
I do have one night autopsy
of remains from Busan...

153
00:11:25,637 --> 00:11:27,301
but it's at 11 p.m. Are you
okay with this?

154
00:11:27,303 --> 00:11:29,502
Of course. See you later Sa Bin.

155
00:11:29,504 --> 00:11:32,570
Why are you calling me so casually?

156
00:11:32,637 --> 00:11:36,004
I'll be working in NFS in five
years. Can't I call you that now?

157
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,896
I'll bring the late night snacks
you like.

compass.

160
00:11:58,104 --> 00:11:59,984
Used a 2G phone until last year.

161
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:03,606
Favorite fruit, unfortunately,
grapefruits.

162
00:12:04,437 --> 00:12:07,825
Relieves stress by eating
classic snacks.

163
00:12:08,304 --> 00:12:10,928
Favorite spot, Dongmyo.

164
00:12:11,737 --> 00:12:15,566
Impossible bucket list, riding
a roller coaster.

165
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:20,037
Favorite sound, the scribbling of
a fountain pen.

166
00:12:21,037 --> 00:12:23,708
Favorite song, "In a Dream."

167
00:12:24,937 --> 00:12:26,410
Favorite type of men...

168
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,027
Prosecutor Kim Su Hyuk?

169
00:13:19,937 --> 00:13:22,700
Su Hyuk, why are you looking at
me like that?

170
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:26,671
Su Hyuk, why are you looking at
me like that?

171
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:31,108
Why? Do you not like it?

172
00:13:33,637 --> 00:13:34,345
No.

173
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:38,994
What about an anadem
instead of a tiara?

174
00:13:38,996 --> 00:13:39,768
An anadem?

175
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:42,761
I think it will fit you very well.

176
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:45,235
How do you about corn cockle
or white tulips?

177
00:13:45,237 --> 00:13:46,937
Bring me something that
reminds me of winter.

178
00:13:47,004 --> 00:13:49,804
Something like boat orchids,
like Christmas.

179
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,396
No, a simple anadem.

180
00:13:53,004 --> 00:13:55,433
- With purple wildflowers.
- Wildflower?

181
00:13:55,899 --> 00:13:58,302
Are you saying wildflowers
fit me?

182
00:14:05,104 --> 00:14:08,235
You know about the gala for legal
personnel next week, right?

183
00:14:08,237 --> 00:14:10,180
Yes, I heard it from the chief.

184
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:13,664
Go home with your mom today.
I have to drop by the office.

185
00:14:13,704 --> 00:14:15,119
But it's a Saturday.

186
00:14:16,441 --> 00:14:17,988
I leave her in your hands.

187
00:14:25,304 --> 00:14:28,602
Does that look like someone
who is about to be married?

188
00:14:28,604 --> 00:14:31,102
I don't care. He's mine now.

189
00:14:31,235 --> 00:14:34,802
I'll make sure to get his love
for the rest of my life.

190
00:14:34,804 --> 00:14:35,940
Love?

191
00:14:37,604 --> 00:14:42,213
If you're the only one giving it out
that's called an obsession.

192
00:14:42,637 --> 00:14:46,568
It's your life. Do whatever
you want.

193
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:49,587
Mom, are you jealous of me?

194
00:14:49,904 --> 00:14:54,358
You've never met a man who
would make you like this.

195
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:59,133
I won't stop you going crazy.

196
00:14:59,737 --> 00:15:01,599
Make sure you return
to your place.

197
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:08,470
Sir, we've caught the perpetrator
of the Lim Hwa Young case.

198
00:15:08,553 --> 00:15:10,408
Do you know Heo Do Jin?

199
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:14,384
The one who got arrested
for assaulting a grandma?

200
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:19,270
He had a woman's fingernail mark...

201
00:15:19,337 --> 00:15:22,104
on his left wrist.

202
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:26,102
We found his skin DNA under
Hwa Young's fingernails.

203
00:15:26,104 --> 00:15:28,926
Fingernail. Do Jin's DNA.

204
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:37,304
Someone who threatened strangers
set up the yellow umbrella in a tub?

205
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:42,337
Who is it? The idiot that
arrested Do Jin?

206
00:15:42,404 --> 00:15:46,568
Do you know the vampire of
the Gwanik station?

207
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:51,282
He won the MMA tournament held by
the chief commissioner.

208
00:15:51,682 --> 00:15:52,904
(Gu Hyul Ki)

209
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:55,234
Good grief!

210
00:15:56,737 --> 00:16:01,602
Did you arrest Do Jin? I didn't
order that. Why did you act out?

211
00:16:01,604 --> 00:16:06,337
I arrested him after Chief Chun
told me it was your orders.

212
00:16:06,404 --> 00:16:10,068
He told me you'll be cautious
because you're under inspection.

213
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:12,837
Don't act unless you hear the orders
directly from me from now on.

214
00:16:12,857 --> 00:16:17,123
I'll be in NFS after 11 p.m. So
bring me the fabricated proof there.

215
00:16:19,653 --> 00:16:21,420
Sir.

216
00:16:22,304 --> 00:16:24,281
Seo Tae Ha is out.

217
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:27,404
I think you need to lay low.

218
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:31,222
He's the one who needs to lay low.
He's in my field now.

219
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:49,204
I'll make sure to let Su Hyuk know
your thoughts deep in his guts.

220
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:53,644
Don't hate your enemy. That clouds
your judgment.

221
00:16:53,904 --> 00:16:56,080
Just go greet him for today.

222
00:16:56,370 --> 00:17:01,737
Tell him he can die at any moment
in any place.

223
00:17:02,037 --> 00:17:05,389
- Let him know just that.
- Yes, sir.

224
00:17:05,544 --> 00:17:06,757
Hello?

225
00:17:07,629 --> 00:17:13,297
Su Hyuk, how have you been
all these years?

226
00:17:19,904 --> 00:17:21,670
I'm tired.

227
00:17:29,604 --> 00:17:32,249
- Where are you?
- I'm almost there.

228
00:17:33,204 --> 00:17:35,419
You know I can't get in without
the ID card, right?

229
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:38,789
- How about you?
- I'm...

230
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:47,640
Is that Prosecutor Su Hyuk?

231
00:17:49,953 --> 00:17:51,001
I'll be right back.

232
00:18:11,337 --> 00:18:13,537
I'll go over there. Where are you?

233
00:18:13,604 --> 00:18:16,894
I'm in the basement parking lot.

234
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:28,570
Oh, no! Prosecutor!

235
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:31,608
Hello? Sa Bin?

236
00:19:11,157 --> 00:19:12,690
You did a good job sharpening
the knife.

237
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:18,337
Close your mouth and open
your eyes.

238
00:19:18,604 --> 00:19:20,457
Do you not see what will happen
to you?

239
00:20:21,336 --> 00:20:22,553
Kim Su Hyuk!

240
00:20:26,961 --> 00:20:27,877
Who are you?

241
00:20:28,857 --> 00:20:30,601
Mind your own business
and move aside.

242
00:20:35,316 --> 00:20:38,797
Until when will you block my way?

243
00:21:22,837 --> 00:21:23,967
Hey you!

244
00:21:24,267 --> 00:21:26,847
Your looks could kill people.

245
00:21:27,507 --> 00:21:29,117
You should think you're lucky.

246
00:21:29,857 --> 00:21:31,747
If it wasn't for me,

247
00:21:31,927 --> 00:21:34,117
he would've torn you into pieces.

248
00:22:17,766 --> 00:22:19,679
Why do you live in
such a dangerous life?

249
00:22:19,681 --> 00:22:21,047
Did you see his eyes?

250
00:22:21,066 --> 00:22:23,056
He came here today to kill you.

251
00:22:24,397 --> 00:22:26,237
Why do you make them
hate you so much?

252
00:22:26,239 --> 00:22:28,504
He's not the only one who hates you.

253
00:22:28,506 --> 00:22:30,736
You have enemies all around you.

254
00:22:31,956 --> 00:22:33,610
Do you think you're the only one
in danger?

255
00:22:33,612 --> 00:22:35,218
Your family is put in danger too.

256
00:22:35,242 --> 00:22:37,421
Don't you have anyone
you wish to protect?

257
00:22:38,755 --> 00:22:41,047
You should fight people with the law
if you're a prosecutor.

258
00:22:41,107 --> 00:22:43,101
You think you're a gangster
or a blackbelt holder.

259
00:22:43,103 --> 00:22:44,726
How will you fight them by yourself?

260
00:22:44,728 --> 00:22:47,731
I'm not a gangster,
but I am a blackbelt holder.

261
00:23:01,554 --> 00:23:03,680
Why do you care
whether I get hurt or not?

262
00:23:04,105 --> 00:23:07,955
I don't want the person I like
to get hurt.

263
00:23:10,213 --> 00:23:12,539
I like you.
And because I like you,

264
00:23:13,189 --> 00:23:15,023
you shouldn't get hurt.

265
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:17,047
Are you making a confession
right now?

266
00:23:17,746 --> 00:23:19,663
You're right. I am.

267
00:23:20,246 --> 00:23:22,032
I realized it
when you got hurt earlier.

268
00:23:22,887 --> 00:23:24,334
I didn't need...

269
00:23:24,813 --> 00:23:26,473
any experiments at all.

270
00:23:38,895 --> 00:23:40,965
Let's pretend that confession
didn't happen.

271
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,125
It's my freedom to like you.

272
00:23:45,474 --> 00:23:47,014
I have a fiancee.

273
00:23:50,202 --> 00:23:53,055
A fiancee?

274
00:23:53,057 --> 00:23:54,531
My wedding invitation will
be out soon.

275
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:55,863
I'll send you one if you'd like one.

276
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:04,290
I mean...

277
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:08,179
he could've just said he didn't
like me than say those words.

278
00:24:09,088 --> 00:24:10,523
Then...

279
00:24:10,525 --> 00:24:12,414
why did he light my path
on my way home?

280
00:24:12,416 --> 00:24:15,914
Why did he risk his life to save me
during that car accident?

281
00:24:16,658 --> 00:24:17,798
Does this make sense?

282
00:24:20,295 --> 00:24:21,665
He's getting married.

283
00:25:00,622 --> 00:25:02,332
It's false evidence.

284
00:25:06,273 --> 00:25:08,833
You don't let other people
drive your car.

285
00:25:10,804 --> 00:25:14,297
What's wrong with his face?
Did he gets dumped or what?

get out of my head?

00:29:18,657 --> 00:29:22,957
because of the fear that I might
be killed by my brother someday.

318
00:29:23,132 --> 00:29:27,031
My brother knows I saw
what happened that day.

319
00:29:29,096 --> 00:29:30,136
Hey.

320
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,170
If it's a sophomore
from medical school,

321
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:33,960
he would've been 15 years old
8 years ago.

322
00:29:34,463 --> 00:29:36,673
He killed a person at 15 years old.

323
00:29:37,812 --> 00:29:39,812
Doesn't that overlap
with Chun Jong Bum's rumors?

324
00:29:39,812 --> 00:29:41,552
That can't be.

325
00:29:42,044 --> 00:29:43,914
But does he paint?

326
00:29:44,438 --> 00:29:45,393
What are you doing here?

327
00:29:48,916 --> 00:29:51,476
Jong Bum, you must've
waited long yesterday.

328
00:29:51,478 --> 00:29:53,328
I'm sorry I didn't call.

329
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:55,625
I'm sure you couldn't
because your phone is here.

330
00:29:56,934 --> 00:29:58,524
That's right.

331
00:29:58,526 --> 00:30:00,397
Where did you find this?

332
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,099
I guess you don't look for things
you lose.

333
00:30:02,101 --> 00:30:02,938
Pardon?

334
00:30:05,028 --> 00:30:07,203
What happened to your face?

335
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:09,047
This...

336
00:30:11,508 --> 00:30:12,976
I'll let you know
if you buy me a meal.

337
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:16,476
Sure. You must've not yet eaten.

338
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:19,445
All right, let's go.
I'm suddenly hungry.

339
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:21,419
Do you want to go together?

340
00:30:21,421 --> 00:30:23,233
- No.
- We need to go.

341
00:30:23,326 --> 00:30:24,869
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

342
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:30,377
Let's go.

343
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:48,050
You can ask me anything
you're curious about now.

344
00:30:49,231 --> 00:30:52,402
It's nothing. Let's go have lunch.

345
00:31:02,549 --> 00:31:04,002
(Episode 14)

346
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:15,235
You used to read books
about psychopaths.

347
00:31:15,236 --> 00:31:16,503
What are those books now?

348
00:31:17,487 --> 00:31:19,487
It's about the genes of Cain.

349
00:31:19,597 --> 00:31:22,642
The genes of psychopaths, MAOK.

350
00:31:22,643 --> 00:31:26,046
According to statistics, 1 in 1,000
people is born with these genes.

351
00:31:26,113 --> 00:31:28,382
Cain, did he have the genes
of a psychopath too?

352
00:31:30,199 --> 00:31:31,691
Who are you talking with?

353
00:31:31,692 --> 00:31:33,879
Right, let's say he had the genes
of a psychopath.

354
00:31:33,887 --> 00:31:36,423
Let's say those genes were
manifested when he was 15.

355
00:31:37,035 --> 00:31:39,823
Let's say he lived with the stigma
as a youth offender.

356
00:31:40,886 --> 00:31:42,663
But his little brother made him
drink detergent.

357
00:31:42,941 --> 00:31:44,498
And what's next?

358
00:31:44,684 --> 00:31:46,552
What would happen next?

359
00:31:52,776 --> 00:31:54,811
You're not in your right mind.

360
00:32:01,081 --> 00:32:02,916
You're not in your right mind.

361
00:32:03,684 --> 00:32:04,785
What is this?

362
00:32:04,786 --> 00:32:07,954
Why are you hooked by Cain and Abel
when you don't even go to church?

363
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:09,816
(Mom)

364
00:32:16,331 --> 00:32:17,901
I returned to Korea yesterday, son.

365
00:32:18,808 --> 00:32:20,901
You know we have a charity gala
in the legal circle tomorrow?

366
00:32:22,253 --> 00:32:23,249
I guess...

367
00:32:23,737 --> 00:32:25,543
you don't want to attend the gala.

368
00:32:25,706 --> 00:32:27,574
- If...
- I'll be there, Mom.

369
00:32:28,105 --> 00:32:29,142
I'm coming.

370
00:32:34,681 --> 00:32:35,849
All right.

371
00:32:36,814 --> 00:32:37,982
I'll wear that.

372
00:32:38,986 --> 00:32:40,266
See you tomorrow, Mom.

373
00:32:42,155 --> 00:32:43,511
(Charity Concert by
the Law Organization, KRC)

374
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,207
Jong Bum?

375
00:33:37,714 --> 00:33:39,124
Why is the door open?

376
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:52,192
The number you have dialed is
currently unavailable...

377
00:33:52,193 --> 00:33:53,627
He's not picking up.

378
00:34:26,011 --> 00:34:27,093
(Charity Concert by
the Law Organization, KRC)

379
00:34:28,617 --> 00:34:31,198
Mom said you should attend
the charity party...

380
00:34:31,598 --> 00:34:32,666
at the weekend.

381
00:34:41,942 --> 00:34:44,945
Why do you think the lord abandoned
Cain and picked Abel?

382
00:34:55,322 --> 00:34:57,823
Cain became the first murderer
of the humankind.

383
00:35:34,277 --> 00:35:36,863
- Please take me to Sangpyung City.
- Yes, ma'am.

384
00:35:45,705 --> 00:35:49,075
The number you have dialed is
currently unavailable...

385
00:37:27,468 --> 00:37:30,276
To make her wealthy husband
a lawmaker, she verbally abused...

386
00:37:30,543 --> 00:37:33,747
employees, beat them, and took clips
of sexual favors.

387
00:37:33,947 --> 00:37:35,715
There's so much I can dig into
this issue.

388
00:37:36,616 --> 00:37:38,218
Would you be okay with that?

389
00:37:39,675 --> 00:37:41,221
Is Jong Bum doing okay?

390
00:37:42,902 --> 00:37:44,425
That's why I plan to...

391
00:37:44,425 --> 00:37:46,972
keep my son-in-law
by my husband's side from now on.

392
00:37:48,113 --> 00:37:49,162
Your son-in-law?

393
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:53,066
Didn't Prosecutor Kim tell you yet?

394
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,370
I like how he is a man
of few words.

395
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,537
- Oh, you're the writer.
- Oh, yes.

396
00:38:30,538 --> 00:38:32,906
- You really are. Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

397
00:38:33,871 --> 00:38:35,942
- Could you give me an autograph?
- Yes, I will.

398
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:41,414
Were you...

399
00:38:41,748 --> 00:38:43,983
going to send me
an wedding invitation at least?

400
00:38:43,984 --> 00:38:46,286
I was figuring out
when I could tell you.

401
00:38:46,686 --> 00:38:48,354
I'm sorry, Chief Prosecutor.

402
00:38:48,363 --> 00:38:50,363
Don't you think that you could be...

403
00:38:50,557 --> 00:38:51,591
digging your own grave?

404
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:56,262
Why would a man like you clean up
after that dubious family?

405
00:38:57,285 --> 00:39:00,366
I know how to draw a line
between public and private matters.

406
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:04,704
(Detective Joo In Do)

407
00:39:39,446 --> 00:39:40,608
I got it.

408
00:39:42,905 --> 00:39:44,502
I don't think you're here
to give support.

409
00:39:44,938 --> 00:39:46,635
Are there dead bodies here too?

410
00:39:48,906 --> 00:39:50,639
Hello, Prosecutor Kim Su Hyuk?

411
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:53,486
Could I go inside?

412
00:39:53,487 --> 00:39:55,889
- Did something happen?
- Well, it's...

413
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:58,198
that there's something I need
to check.

414
00:39:58,757 --> 00:40:00,423
You have so much to check,
don't' you?

415
00:40:59,754 --> 00:41:00,853
Chun Jong Bum.

416
00:41:05,916 --> 00:41:07,816
Did you really come here?

417
00:41:09,162 --> 00:41:10,463
You're alone even here.

418
00:41:11,365 --> 00:41:13,057
You can't fit in anywhere.

419
00:41:17,637 --> 00:41:21,405
You'll be alone for the rest of your
life, why not jump in and die?

420
00:41:25,545 --> 00:41:26,543
Why?

421
00:41:26,713 --> 00:41:27,780
Do you not want to die?

422
00:41:28,915 --> 00:41:30,516
Then kill me.

423
00:41:32,886 --> 00:41:33,886
Should I?

424
00:41:51,262 --> 00:41:55,425
Save me. Someone! Save me!

425
00:41:55,771 --> 00:41:58,871
Help me!

426
00:42:00,447 --> 00:42:02,013
- Save me!
- No!

427
00:42:02,038 --> 00:42:03,305
Help!

428
00:42:09,997 --> 00:42:11,464
Save me!

429
00:43:47,854 --> 00:43:50,755
Sa Bin, wake up. Sa Bin!

430
00:44:07,474 --> 00:44:10,674
Sa Bin, wake up!

431
00:44:17,806 --> 00:44:20,670
Death, it feels weird.

432
00:44:21,423 --> 00:44:22,990
It doesn't feel strange.

433
00:44:26,827 --> 00:44:29,060
- Hyung Bin.
- Ha Eun.

434
00:44:36,808 --> 00:44:40,242
Why can't I die?

435
00:44:47,114 --> 00:44:48,381
I miss him.

436
00:44:49,033 --> 00:44:52,166
I miss him so much.

437
00:45:08,339 --> 00:45:09,472
My heart beats...

438
00:45:10,335 --> 00:45:12,104
whenever I see this man.

439
00:45:12,323 --> 00:45:15,360
It always does.

440
00:45:48,798 --> 00:45:50,199
Are you sure you're okay?

441
00:45:50,777 --> 00:45:52,011
Are you okay?

442
00:45:52,203 --> 00:45:53,937
I'm so relieved.

443
00:46:05,064 --> 00:46:06,231
Move.

444
00:46:06,808 --> 00:46:08,476
Why is he like this?

445
00:46:08,501 --> 00:46:10,069
- Hang in there.
- What happened?

446
00:46:10,564 --> 00:46:12,431
Jong Woo!

447
00:46:16,567 --> 00:46:17,700
Are you okay?

448
00:46:18,408 --> 00:46:19,708
Are you sure you're okay?

449
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:23,320
Is the boy alive?

450
00:46:25,466 --> 00:46:26,733
He is.

451
00:46:27,114 --> 00:46:28,948
You almost died though.

452
00:46:29,592 --> 00:46:31,592
Why are you so reckless?

453
00:46:48,568 --> 00:46:50,503
She saved him.

454
00:46:51,905 --> 00:46:54,774
- I can't believe this happened.
- How did this happen?

455
00:47:34,662 --> 00:47:37,262
Sa Bin, wake up.

456
00:47:37,412 --> 00:47:38,612
Sa Bin!

457
00:47:44,252 --> 00:47:45,652
Are you awake?

458
00:47:46,026 --> 00:47:48,527
Wait here. I'll call the doctor.

459
00:48:00,974 --> 00:48:05,208
We tested him, but other than
the flesh wound, nothing's wrong.

460
00:48:05,345 --> 00:48:09,279
But the water in his lungs could
cause problems later...

461
00:48:09,304 --> 00:48:12,547
so he should stay here for a day.

462
00:48:12,953 --> 00:48:13,950
Okay.

463
00:48:14,888 --> 00:48:17,722
I called professor Cha on my
way here. Did you hear?

464
00:48:17,747 --> 00:48:20,976
Yes, we'll help you
with the admission process.

465
00:48:25,958 --> 00:48:27,492
Jong Bum saved you.

466
00:48:28,201 --> 00:48:29,568
Say thank you.

467
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:32,207
Jong Bum.

468
00:48:33,186 --> 00:48:35,286
You know I can't swim.

469
00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:38,182
Why did you call me there?

470
00:48:39,312 --> 00:48:43,413
You knew the bridge was broken,
didn't you?

471
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:44,843
Jong Bum.

472
00:48:55,299 --> 00:48:56,566
You murderer!

473
00:49:09,353 --> 00:49:10,921
Lower your voice, you're in
a hospital.

474
00:49:10,944 --> 00:49:12,725
Is that what's important to you?

475
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:14,384
Jong Bum tried to kill me!

476
00:49:14,409 --> 00:49:15,554
I told you to be quiet.

477
00:49:15,579 --> 00:49:16,712
Is this true?

478
00:49:20,641 --> 00:49:22,908
Now you try to kill my son?

479
00:49:23,824 --> 00:49:26,691
I covered you for Lim Hwa Young.

480
00:49:30,230 --> 00:49:32,630
Did you ever think
that it wasn't me?

481
00:49:34,768 --> 00:49:35,801
What?

482
00:49:37,037 --> 00:49:38,971
Did you ever think that I wasn't...

483
00:49:40,407 --> 00:49:42,008
the one who killed Hwa Young?

484
00:49:42,033 --> 00:49:46,867
Then bring me the killer yourself.

485
00:49:49,182 --> 00:49:50,516
I'll talk to him.

486
00:49:50,979 --> 00:49:52,413
He's my son.

487
00:49:54,635 --> 00:49:55,902
I have nothing to say.

488
00:50:13,997 --> 00:50:15,764
Did you try to kill Jong Woo?

489
00:50:15,789 --> 00:50:16,791
Yes.

490
00:50:17,032 --> 00:50:18,366
Let me ask you again.

491
00:50:18,721 --> 00:50:21,555
Did you try to kill my son?

492
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:23,694
You said you didn't care
if I killed.

493
00:50:34,861 --> 00:50:36,970
I said I was okay with murder.

494
00:50:38,665 --> 00:50:40,832
I didn't say you can touch
what's mine.

495
00:50:43,637 --> 00:50:44,639
Mom.

496
00:50:46,807 --> 00:50:47,837
Speak.

497
00:50:47,862 --> 00:50:49,629
Jong Woo gets sick a lot.

498
00:50:50,188 --> 00:50:52,555
If I was sick that often...

499
00:50:53,605 --> 00:50:55,540
what would you have done with me?

500
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:57,880
What?

501
00:50:58,439 --> 00:51:00,472
If I was normal like Jong Woo...

502
00:51:04,635 --> 00:51:06,064
you would've abandoned me.

503
00:51:21,507 --> 00:51:22,908
(Vacant)

504
00:51:41,785 --> 00:51:44,864
(I think I'll find you first.
I was there too.)

505
00:51:45,009 --> 00:51:47,859
I saw you too. I knew all along...

506
00:51:48,518 --> 00:51:49,969
about your signature.

507
00:51:58,979 --> 00:52:01,046
Someone told me to give this to you.

508
00:52:09,388 --> 00:52:12,358
(I can kill that lady for you
if you wish.)

509
00:52:27,042 --> 00:52:29,742
- I need to clarify something.
- Let's talk another time.

510
00:52:33,746 --> 00:52:35,908
No, let's talk now.

511
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:40,242
No matter how much
you wanted to kill your brother,

512
00:52:40,814 --> 00:52:42,788
not everyone kills
their own brother.

513
00:52:42,813 --> 00:52:45,680
Are you trying to prove
that you're different from me?

514
00:52:46,225 --> 00:52:49,148
- Pardon?
- I'd like to ask you something too.

515
00:52:49,845 --> 00:52:52,859
Why did you...

516
00:52:53,838 --> 00:52:56,476
- save Jong Woo?
- Because it shouldn't happen.

517
00:52:56,568 --> 00:52:58,203
- It shouldn't?
- You...

518
00:52:59,236 --> 00:53:01,106
shouldn't become a murderer.

519
00:53:13,557 --> 00:53:15,072
I’m already a murderer.

520
00:53:15,213 --> 00:53:17,463
I told you
I wasn't interested in your past.

521
00:53:17,463 --> 00:53:20,993
My past? I'm a murderer...

522
00:53:21,549 --> 00:53:25,150
today and in the future.
I may have failed today,

523
00:53:29,236 --> 00:53:31,036
but I'm going to kill Jong Woo
in the end.

524
00:53:44,229 --> 00:53:45,822
You didn't kill him.

525
00:53:46,893 --> 00:53:48,620
It's a relief you didn't kill him.

526
00:53:49,791 --> 00:53:51,890
If I had been a little late,

527
00:53:52,814 --> 00:53:54,626
you would've become...

528
00:53:55,221 --> 00:53:57,529
completely different...

529
00:53:57,554 --> 00:54:00,265
from who you are right now.

530
00:54:02,729 --> 00:54:05,637
I'm happy I wasn't late...

531
00:54:06,555 --> 00:54:08,428
and that I was able to stop you...

532
00:54:09,111 --> 00:54:10,275
from making a regret.

533
00:54:17,767 --> 00:54:21,361
You can win this.
Fight the monster in you.

534
00:54:22,403 --> 00:54:25,023
I'll make you win.

535
00:54:59,143 --> 00:55:02,250
Did you hear it?
My performance was the worst.

536
00:55:03,643 --> 00:55:05,451
I told you to correct your habit
of pulling the strings.

537
00:55:05,453 --> 00:55:08,867
Do you want to marry a woman
who has a bad habit like this?

538
00:55:08,867 --> 00:55:11,917
You can fix that. I can bear it.

539
00:55:12,378 --> 00:55:13,425
Let's go.

540
00:55:17,526 --> 00:55:20,712
- Why are you being like this?
- Why did you rescue her?

541
00:55:21,526 --> 00:55:23,749
There were two people
drowning in water.

542
00:55:24,090 --> 00:55:26,652
Why was it her?
That was the second time.

543
00:55:27,603 --> 00:55:29,855
I only rescued the person
that needed to be rescued first.

544
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:32,624
- She has heart disease.
- Do you know how your eyes look...

545
00:55:32,972 --> 00:55:34,479
when looking at her?

546
00:55:34,952 --> 00:55:37,797
You've never looked at me that way.

547
00:55:38,128 --> 00:55:41,664
You've never looked
at any other woman like that.

548
00:55:42,909 --> 00:55:45,270
You're still illogical like a child.

549
00:55:46,752 --> 00:55:48,469
The promise I made
to marry you is...

550
00:55:49,003 --> 00:55:50,809
also a promise I made myself.

551
00:55:51,086 --> 00:55:53,946
I've never broken a promise
I made myself.

552
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:57,115
Whether it's cold or hot,

553
00:55:58,253 --> 00:55:59,820
this is the logic of my emotions.

554
00:56:01,453 --> 00:56:03,722
Do you remember, Su Hyuk?

555
00:56:04,807 --> 00:56:07,459
We first met
at the Philip Jang Theater.

556
00:56:07,793 --> 00:56:10,262
What was the reason
you accepted my date request?

557
00:56:11,292 --> 00:56:14,733
- Was it because I was pretty?
- It was a long time ago. Let's go.

558
00:56:15,270 --> 00:56:18,073
Tell me. What was the reason?

559
00:56:18,572 --> 00:56:20,994
- I liked what you said.
- What were they?

560
00:56:22,706 --> 00:56:25,402
Don't you think Philip Jang is
really sexy?

561
00:56:25,511 --> 00:56:28,780
His heart and my heart were
connected.

562
00:56:29,114 --> 00:56:31,016
Philip Jang's real name is
Jang Ki Pyo.

563
00:56:31,016 --> 00:56:33,852
He's been addicted to drugs
since 17 and committed rape.

564
00:56:33,852 --> 00:56:36,054
He changed his identity abroad.

565
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:39,591
Artists usually have a monster
within them.

566
00:56:40,237 --> 00:56:43,495
I want to sleep not with his body
but his soul...

567
00:56:44,190 --> 00:56:46,098
this very night.

568
00:56:48,972 --> 00:56:50,936
I don't want to embrace your body...

569
00:56:51,370 --> 00:56:53,047
but your soul instead.

570
00:56:53,385 --> 00:56:54,506
It was then.

571
00:56:54,862 --> 00:56:57,604
When you said you wanted to sleep
with his soul and not his body,

572
00:56:58,198 --> 00:56:59,839
I wanted to meet you again.

573
00:57:00,975 --> 00:57:04,178
I was curious about what kind
of lady would talk like that.

574
00:57:30,025 --> 00:57:31,695
You're right. I am.

575
00:57:33,378 --> 00:57:35,380
I realized it
when you got hurt earlier.

576
00:57:35,838 --> 00:57:39,017
I didn't need any experiments
at all.

577
00:58:13,541 --> 00:58:14,870
I see it.

578
00:58:29,948 --> 00:58:31,261
I like you.

579
00:58:32,409 --> 00:58:33,878
Because I like you,

580
00:58:34,126 --> 00:58:36,475
you shouldn't get hurt.

581
00:58:38,526 --> 00:58:40,746
I realized it
when you got hurt earlier.

582
00:58:41,610 --> 00:58:42,940
I didn't need...

583
00:58:43,730 --> 00:58:45,276
any experiments at all.

584
00:59:29,221 --> 00:59:31,511
(You'll end up killing
the one you love.)

585
01:00:01,310 --> 01:00:02,694
(Born Again)

586
01:00:02,822 --> 01:00:06,231
Why do you exclude Gong Ji Chul
from the list of suspects?

587
01:00:06,363 --> 01:00:08,033
It has been recorded on the camera.

588
01:00:08,033 --> 01:00:11,604
Do you think the last page is
a fiction or a fact?

589
01:00:11,604 --> 01:00:14,406
I was told there was someone
who's trying to kill my daughter.

590
01:00:14,431 --> 01:00:17,862
Are you here to see my father?
Why is that?

591
01:00:17,862 --> 01:00:21,680
Remember two kinds of eyes
between those that are trying...

592
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:23,515
to kill you and those
who are trying to save you.

593
01:00:23,625 --> 01:00:27,152
If you die, I can live
by longing for this moment.

594
01:00:27,261 --> 01:00:29,354
I only love the ones I choose.
