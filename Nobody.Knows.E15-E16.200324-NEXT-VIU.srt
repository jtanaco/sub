00:00:31,013 --> 00:00:32,219

<b>- What? - You're finally resting.</b>

10

<b>This is your body telling you to slow down.</b>

11

<b>Have you eaten?</b>

12
00:00:48,198 --> 00:00:50,603
<b>I bought some porridge, so don't worry.</b>

<b>Don't force yourself since it'll only ruin your eyesight.</b>

18

47

<b>So what about your age?</b>

48
00:05:27,509 --> 00:05:29,339
<b>Back in the day, I'd work for a week straight...</b>

<b>- And the location? - Nae-dong, Incheon.</b>

62
00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:54,313
<b>That's where Jang Ki Ho lives.</b>

63
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,098
<b>Do you think his cell phone might be at his house...</b>

64
00:05:57,098 --> 00:05:59,214
<b>just like Lee Young Sik, the guy who disappeared?</b>

<b>Yes, Ms. Cha.</b>

<b>"Forensics"? What is it this time?</b>

69
00:06:14,048 --> 00:06:16,993
<b>Sir, Ms. Cha went to Kevin Jung's house...</b>

70
00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:21,259
<b>and found him dead.</b>

71
00:06:21,259 --> 00:06:22,334
<b>What?</b>

72
00:06:38,579 --> 00:06:40,454
<b>There are no fatal injuries.</b>

<b>("The Life Before Us")</b>

74

<b>If you guys had kept staying here,</b>

75

<b>you would've been able to stop this from happening.</b>

76
00:07:31,469 --> 00:07:33,503
<b>- I'm sorry, sir. - I'm sorry, sir.</b>

77
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:35,144
<b>It's not their fault.</b>

78
00:07:35,969 --> 00:07:38,414
<b>The only person at fault is the person who did this.</b>

79
00:07:39,769 --> 00:07:40,769
<b>What's the cause of death?</b>

80
00:07:40,769 --> 00:07:42,383
<b>I need to check something first.</b>

81
00:07:58,129 --> 00:07:59,803
<b>How many times did he inject himself?</b>

82
00:07:59,889 --> 00:08:02,003
<b>He took enough to kill himself.</b>

83
00:08:02,129 --> 00:08:03,604
<b>You can take him now.</b>

84
00:08:07,969 --> 00:08:09,938
<b>There weren't any fatal injuries on Kevin Jung's body.</b>

85
00:08:09,938 --> 00:08:11,709
<b>Then did he die because he overdosed on meth?</b>

86
00:08:11,709 --> 00:08:13,613
<b>And heroin.</b>

87
00:08:15,139 --> 00:08:17,108
<b>There was white powder near his nose.</b>

88
00:08:17,108 --> 00:08:18,253
<b>He did both?</b>

89
00:08:19,048 --> 00:08:20,678
<b>I guess he wanted to die.</b>

90
00:08:20,678 --> 00:08:22,279
<b>Do you die if you do them both together?</b>

91
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:25,649
<b>Meth stimulates your body and heroin calms you down.</b>

92
00:08:25,649 --> 00:08:27,219
<b>If you mix and take them together,</b>

93
00:08:27,219 --> 00:08:29,193
<b>it overstrains your heart.</b>

94
00:08:29,659 --> 00:08:31,588
<b>Meth makes you feel invincible.</b>

95
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:34,304
<b>Heroin makes you feel high and hallucinate.</b>

96
00:08:34,529 --> 00:08:37,099
<b>No one seems to have broken into his house.</b>

97
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:39,567
<b>And I couldn't find any signs of physical struggle on his body.</b>

98
00:08:39,568 --> 00:08:42,599
<b>But it looked like Kevin Jung's hands were tied.</b>

99
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:43,743
<b>That means...</b>

100
00:08:44,509 --> 00:08:46,013
<b>someone was involved in his death.</b>

101
00:08:46,038 --> 00:08:48,009
<b>Isn't it obvious? I bet it was Lee Young Sik.</b>

102
00:08:48,009 --> 00:08:50,239
<b>If Lee Young Sik was the one who killed him,</b>

103
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:51,883
<b>he probably gave him heroin first...</b>

104
00:08:52,308 --> 00:08:54,954
<b>and then injected meth after he brought Kevin Jung home.</b>

<b>Did you meet Ha Min Sung?</b>

116
00:09:29,979 --> 00:09:31,324
<b>I didn't even get to talk to him.</b>

117
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:34,594
<b>- Why? - He got hurt.</b>

118
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,804
<b>Yes, ma'am. The doctor told me he's okay.</b>

119
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:43,334
<b>Oh, I see. Drive safely.</b>

120
00:09:44,058 --> 00:09:45,174
<b>Okay, bye.</b>

<b>Min Sung.</b>

<b>Do you still not remember what happened?</b>

125
00:10:02,249 --> 00:10:03,354
<b>Let's go.</b>

126
00:10:04,349 --> 00:10:05,724
<b>We'll leave you to get some rest.</b>

127
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:21,243
<b>He's probably shocked.</b>

128
00:10:24,968 --> 00:10:26,139
<b>- Sun Woo. - Do you really think...</b>

129
00:10:26,139 --> 00:10:27,383
<b>Dong Myung hurt him?</b>

130
00:10:27,409 --> 00:10:30,409
<b>What are you talking about? You saw what happened.</b>

131
00:10:30,409 --> 00:10:31,484
<b>I mean...</b>

132
00:10:31,909 --> 00:10:34,023
<b>Min Sung can't remember anything.</b>

133

<b>And we didn't even ask Dong Myung.</b>

134
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:38,393
<b>If he didn't do anything, he would've said so already.</b>

135
00:10:38,849 --> 00:10:41,194
<b>But he only told me one thing.</b>

136
00:10:41,259 --> 00:10:42,818
<b>He didn't tell me that it wasn't him.</b>

137
00:10:42,818 --> 00:10:44,804
<b>He just told me that he wants to follow the detective.</b>

138
00:10:50,129 --> 00:10:51,204
<b>Sun Woo.</b>

139
00:10:52,229 --> 00:10:55,844
<b>Let's not punish Min Sung for what he did.</b>

140
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:58,814
<b>For what he did?</b>

141
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:01,109
<b>You're going to stay quiet about the test leak?</b>

142

<b>The head of Administration will get disciplined.</b>

143
00:11:02,509 --> 00:11:04,548
<b>For something else other than the test leak?</b>

144
00:11:04,548 --> 00:11:07,084
<b>I'll make sure this doesn't happen again.</b>

145
00:11:07,749 --> 00:11:08,824
<b>Okay?</b>

146
00:11:14,659 --> 00:11:15,793

<b>I'm sorry.</b>

<b>He's getting investigated by the police.</b>

151

<b>I heard your brother's surgery went well.</b>

152
00:11:39,249 --> 00:11:41,454
<b>- Yes. - I'll drop by pretty soon.</b>

153
00:11:41,479 --> 00:11:43,393
<b>- It's okay. - What do you mean?</b>

154
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:45,964
<b>Don't let it bother you.</b>

155

<b>That means I'm also free to care.</b>

156

<b>Shall we begin?</b>

157

158

<b>Min Sung, don't worry about anything and just get some good rest.</b>

<b>Okay. Bye, sir.</b>

<b>Mr. Lee, I'll leave you to take care of everything.</b>

<b>- Okay, sir. - Goodbye, ma'am.</b>

168

<b>I can't believe...</b>

169
00:12:36,999 --> 00:12:39,509
<b>this happened to my son.</b>

170
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:42,153
<b>What do his parents do?</b>

171
00:12:42,409 --> 00:12:44,623
<b>How could they not even come here to apologize?</b>

172
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:47,253
<b>Can we talk outside?</b>

173
00:12:47,448 --> 00:12:50,653
<b>I bet he's not from a stable family.</b>

<b>- Mr. Lee. - Yes?</b>

<b>Will you please excuse us? I'd like to talk to my son.</b>

176
00:12:57,859 --> 00:12:59,633
<b>Okay, I'll be outside.</b>

177
00:13:10,698 --> 00:13:12,143
<b>Did he do this to you?</b>

178
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:14,814
<b>No?</b>

179
00:13:19,678 --> 00:13:20,924
<b>What happened?</b>

180
00:13:26,588 --> 00:13:30,263
<b>I took him to the science lab so we could talk about Eun Ho.</b>

181
00:13:30,718 --> 00:13:32,859
<b>Did he follow you willingly?</b>

182
00:13:32,859 --> 00:13:33,934
<b>No.</b>

183
00:13:34,558 --> 00:13:35,899
<b>I dragged him there.</b>

184
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:36,974
<b>How?</b>

185
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:39,243
<b>I grabbed him by the arm.</b>

186
00:13:39,629 --> 00:13:42,013
<b>What did you talk about once you got to the science lab?</b>

187
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:44,783
<b>I talked about his driver.</b>

188
00:13:45,838 --> 00:13:48,013
<b>I told him that he was the one who hurt Eun Ho.</b>

189
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:51,214
<b>And I asked him if he was behind everything.</b>

190
00:13:51,479 --> 00:13:53,047
<b>What did he say?</b>

191
00:13:53,048 --> 00:13:55,424
<b>He acted like he was startled to hear...</b>

192
00:13:55,619 --> 00:13:57,054
<b>that Eun Ho fell from the hotel.</b>

193
00:13:57,418 --> 00:13:59,393
<b>Are you sure he wasn't actually startled?</b>

194
00:13:59,788 --> 00:14:01,763
<b>I'm not sure.</b>

195
00:14:03,688 --> 00:14:07,663
<b>He told me that Eun Ho probably fell from the hotel because of me.</b>

196
00:14:07,859 --> 00:14:10,633
<b>Didn't Eun Ho jump because of you?</b>

197
00:14:11,499 --> 00:14:13,804
<b>- What? - You were stealing money from him.</b>

198
00:14:14,029 --> 00:14:15,344
<b>I saw it many times.</b>

199
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:17,944
<b>I would've wanted to jump...</b>

200
00:14:19,009 --> 00:14:21,214
<b>if a hobo like you had stolen my money too.</b>

201
00:14:21,379 --> 00:14:22,454
<b>You little...</b>

202
00:14:37,058 --> 00:14:40,204
<b>You're right. I'm a hobo and a bully.</b>

203
00:14:41,259 --> 00:14:42,373
<b>But...</b>

204
00:14:42,729 --> 00:14:44,844
<b>even a guy like me has a friend.</b>

205
00:14:45,168 --> 00:14:46,944
<b>Someone who almost died because of you.</b>

206
00:14:47,468 --> 00:14:50,444
<b>I might continue to be a hobo,</b>

207
00:14:50,499 --> 00:14:52,143
<b>but I'm going to stop being a bully...</b>

208
00:14:52,538 --> 00:14:54,984
<b>so that Eun Ho doesn't get embarrassed by me.</b>

209
00:14:56,139 --> 00:14:58,109
<b>If I could have things my way,</b>

210
00:14:58,109 --> 00:14:59,753
<b>I'd beat you to a pulp.</b>

211
00:15:00,308 --> 00:15:01,424
<b>But I won't.</b>

212
00:15:11,288 --> 00:15:12,434
<b>Min Sung.</b>

213
00:15:13,259 --> 00:15:14,934
<b>Be careful of your driver.</b>

214
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:16,734
<b>He's not even human.</b>

215
00:15:17,999 --> 00:15:19,174
<b>Stop it!</b>

216
00:15:23,838 --> 00:15:25,643
<b>I grabbed him by the collar and stopped him.</b>

217
00:15:26,068 --> 00:15:28,584
<b>And that's when Detective Cha opened the door.</b>

218
00:15:29,609 --> 00:15:31,584
<b>No one else would've believed me.</b>

219
00:15:31,849 --> 00:15:33,409
<b>But Detective Cha believed it wasn't me...</b>

220

<b>without even asking me anything.</b>

221

222
00:15:36,678 --> 00:15:38,263
<b>I'll check.</b>

223

226

<b>What if he lies?</b>

227
00:15:56,938 --> 00:15:59,243
<b>I mean, he will lie.</b>

228
00:15:59,538 --> 00:16:02,253
<b>No one saw us. Who would believe me?</b>

229

<b>Eun Ho himself said that he was pestering you?</b>

230

<b>That's fine. That will do.</b>

231

<b>Mix some lies in with the truth.</b>

<b>In that situation,</b>

<b>But you didn't.</b>

255

<b>Who did that to him if I didn't?</b>

00:20:45,889 --> 00:20:48,458
<b>so he was injected about 30 minutes before.</b>

316
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:50,028
<b>So he was poisoned.</b>

317
00:20:50,028 --> 00:20:53,343
<b>An accident, suicide, or murder. Which could it be?</b>

318
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:03,583
<b>It looks like Lee Young Sik was drugged too.</b>

319
00:21:03,938 --> 00:21:06,349
<b>Did they mess up while injecting each other?</b>

320
00:21:06,349 --> 00:21:08,549
<b>What's more important is...</b>

321
00:21:08,549 --> 00:21:10,654
<b>why they had Eun Ho's backpack.</b>

322
00:21:10,748 --> 00:21:12,289
<b>And why was it...</b>

323
00:21:12,289 --> 00:21:14,688
<b>left with Kevin Jung's body?</b>

324
00:21:14,688 --> 00:21:17,364
<b>Eun Ho didn't have that bag the day he fell.</b>

325
00:21:17,488 --> 00:21:20,289
<b>These guys were after him for a while.</b>

326
00:21:20,289 --> 00:21:22,904
<b>They found out where the 30,000 dollars went.</b>

327
00:21:23,329 --> 00:21:25,944
<b>That's why they took Eun Ho's bag.</b>

328
00:21:26,028 --> 00:21:27,668
<b>But the money wasn't there.</b>

329
00:21:27,668 --> 00:21:30,099
<b>They threatened him for the whereabouts and he fell.</b>

330
00:21:30,099 --> 00:21:31,139
<b>Choi Dae Hoon the accomplice...</b>

331
00:21:31,139 --> 00:21:32,909
<b>was hanged for some unknown reason.</b>

332
00:21:32,909 --> 00:21:34,243
<b>That's a clean tie-up.</b>

333
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:37,614
<b>But Choi Dae Hoon could not be an accomplice.</b>

334
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:39,549
<b>Don't just take the pieces...</b>

335
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:41,478
<b>that fit your conclusion...</b>

336
00:21:41,478 --> 00:21:43,448
<b>and use everything and see if they fit.</b>

337
00:21:43,448 --> 00:21:44,553
<b>Yes, sir.</b>

338
00:21:45,349 --> 00:21:46,924
<b>It's the Eunpyeong-gu Office control room.</b>

339
00:21:47,418 --> 00:21:48,533
<b>Hello?</b>

340
00:21:49,819 --> 00:21:52,204
<b>Eungam-dong, 11:58?</b>

341

<b>To Seodaemun-gu?</b>

342
00:21:57,059 --> 00:21:59,144
<b>Oh, okay. Thank you.</b>

343
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:02,738
<b>Lee Young Sik was last seen at 11:58 in Eungam-dong.</b>

344
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:04,899
<b>He only got that far in all that time?</b>

345
00:22:04,899 --> 00:22:07,238
<b>Yes. He was on foot.</b>

346
00:22:07,238 --> 00:22:08,369
<b>To Seodaemun-gu?</b>

347
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:10,909
<b>Yes. They called that office's control room already.</b>

348
00:22:10,909 --> 00:22:13,508
<b>If he stays on foot, we can follow him in real-time.</b>

349
00:22:13,508 --> 00:22:15,079
<b>Team 1, go to Seodaemun-gu Office.</b>

<b>- Okay. - Okay.</b>

351
00:22:16,778 --> 00:22:18,894
<b>- Jang Ki Ho... - Team 2 will find him.</b>

352
00:22:19,218 --> 00:22:20,293
<b>Okay.</b>

<b>Hurry up.</b>

00:22:42,109 --> 00:22:43,214
<b>What's this?</b>

357
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:45,154
<b>What's this?</b>

<b>Follow me.</b>

<b>Why won't you get in?</b>

360
00:23:03,698 --> 00:23:05,033
<b>What floor to, sir?</b>

361
00:23:15,678 --> 00:23:17,339
<b>You live here alone?</b>

362
00:23:17,339 --> 00:23:18,484
<b>What?</b>

363
00:23:18,809 --> 00:23:20,853
<b>I share it with family-like friends.</b>

364
00:23:21,208 --> 00:23:23,224
<b>I don't invite just anyone here.</b>

365
00:23:23,448 --> 00:23:25,224
<b>- How is it? - It's nice.</b>

366
00:23:25,688 --> 00:23:28,224
<b>It's large and spacious.</b>

367

<b>Isn't it a bother if the toilet's far away?</b>

368
00:23:32,329 --> 00:23:33,904
<b>I never thought about that.</b>

369
00:23:35,458 --> 00:23:36,533
<b>I should move.</b>

370
00:23:37,498 --> 00:23:38,743
<b>Serve him.</b>

371
00:23:50,678 --> 00:23:52,508
<b>Is this a light meal?</b>

372
00:23:52,508 --> 00:23:54,208
<b>I said I'd eat light,</b>

373

<b>but you didn't say anything.</b>

374

<b>Bring that over.</b>

375
00:24:02,059 --> 00:24:04,234
<b>Shall we dig in?</b>

<b>You can start. I have to wait for three minutes.</b>

378
00:24:17,438 --> 00:24:19,843
<b>I might as well tell you when you're smiling.</b>

379
00:24:20,008 --> 00:24:21,069
<b>About what?</b>

380
00:24:21,069 --> 00:24:23,154
<b>Did you meet the guy who looks after Eun Ho?</b>

381
00:24:23,678 --> 00:24:26,083
<b>- No. - His name is Kim Tae Hyung.</b>

382
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:28,624
<b>He works for my foundation.</b>

383
00:24:29,379 --> 00:24:32,023
<b>Stories of his childhood remind me a lot about you.</b>

384
00:24:32,349 --> 00:24:34,993
<b>He was framed and kicked out of school.</b>

385
00:24:40,859 --> 00:24:42,073
<b>He's a good kid,</b>

386
00:24:42,129 --> 00:24:44,329
<b>but the heartless world and cruel adults...</b>

387
00:24:44,329 --> 00:24:46,303
<b>turned him thorny and hostile.</b>

388
00:24:46,498 --> 00:24:48,204
<b>He had no expectations for the world...</b>

389
00:24:48,428 --> 00:24:50,339
<b>or hope in mankind,</b>

390
00:24:50,339 --> 00:24:52,139
<b>and was just wasting his life.</b>

391
00:24:52,139 --> 00:24:54,214
<b>I saw him for what he could be.</b>

392
00:24:54,369 --> 00:24:57,978
<b>I knew he could change if he worked with us.</b>

393
00:24:57,978 --> 00:24:59,053
<b>So...</b>

394
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:01,924
<b>how did he change?</b>

395
00:25:03,278 --> 00:25:04,853
<b>I can trust him around Eun Ho.</b>

396
00:25:06,248 --> 00:25:08,518
<b>Was that explanation not enough?</b>

397
00:25:08,518 --> 00:25:10,364
<b>No. It's more than enough.</b>

398
00:25:10,918 --> 00:25:12,829
<b>And three minutes have passed.</b>

399
00:25:12,829 --> 00:25:14,563
<b>Don't you lie to me.</b>

400
00:25:16,659 --> 00:25:17,904
<b>It's cooked.</b>

401
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:20,073
<b>You can eat. Eat up.</b>

402
00:25:24,268 --> 00:25:26,513
<b>You were there when Eun Ho was awarded, right?</b>

403
00:25:26,938 --> 00:25:28,114
<b>Did you hear my speech?</b>

404
00:25:28,738 --> 00:25:31,454
<b>Yes. It was entertaining.</b>

405
00:25:32,109 --> 00:25:34,053
<b>I didn't know it was true.</b>

406
00:25:34,508 --> 00:25:36,424
<b>The different between human beings and animals.</b>

407
00:25:36,518 --> 00:25:40,323
<b>Human beings protect the weak if they're stronger...</b>

408
00:25:41,049 --> 00:25:43,734
<b>and that's why you wanted to gain power.</b>

409
00:25:43,859 --> 00:25:45,164
<b>I didn't believe it back then.</b>

410
00:25:53,369 --> 00:25:54,829
<b>I'm Chief Hwang In Bum,</b>

411
00:25:54,829 --> 00:25:57,444
<b>and I'm in charge of your son and Dong Myung's case.</b>

412
00:25:59,339 --> 00:26:01,444
<b>He must've done something terrible...</b>

413
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:03,414
<b>for a high-ranking officer...</b>

414
00:26:03,708 --> 00:26:05,379
<b>to take this case.</b>

415
00:26:05,379 --> 00:26:08,793
<b>Well, I happened to have met the boy before.</b>

416
00:26:09,718 --> 00:26:13,023
<b>Anyway, could I please have a moment with your son?</b>

417
00:26:13,649 --> 00:26:16,734
<b>He's also aware of the case involving Min Sung's driver.</b>

418
00:26:17,218 --> 00:26:19,464
<b>This is just my opinion,</b>

419
00:26:20,228 --> 00:26:23,773
<b>but Min Sung would feel more comfortable talking to him too.</b>

420
00:26:25,668 --> 00:26:26,773
<b>Go ahead then.</b>

421
00:26:35,809 --> 00:26:38,154
<b>Dong Myung dragged me to the science lab,</b>

422
00:26:38,409 --> 00:26:40,624
<b>but I don't remember what happened in the lab.</b>

423
00:26:40,778 --> 00:26:43,894
<b>You don't remember what you two talked about either?</b>

424
00:26:47,549 --> 00:26:49,333
<b>He mentioned Eun Ho out of the blue...</b>

425
00:26:49,659 --> 00:26:51,434
<b>saying that he fell from a hotel rooftop.</b>

426
00:26:51,789 --> 00:26:54,333
<b>Then he accused Uncle Dae Hoon...</b>

427
00:26:54,528 --> 00:26:56,474
<b>and spoke ill of him.</b>

428
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:59,174
<b>It must've made you angry...</b>

429
00:26:59,928 --> 00:27:01,803
<b>and upset.</b>

430
00:27:06,369 --> 00:27:07,843
<b>I don't know.</b>

431
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:11,283
<b>I was startled, that's all.</b>

432
00:27:12,208 --> 00:27:16,253
<b>It seems like your driver was responsible for hurting Eun Ho.</b>

433
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:19,263
<b>Min Sung,</b>

434
00:27:19,549 --> 00:27:22,394
<b>did your driver lay his hands on Eun Ho...</b>

435
00:27:22,988 --> 00:27:25,364
<b>for your sake?</b>

436
00:27:25,988 --> 00:27:28,629
<b>Eun Ho once told Dong Myung...</b>

437
00:27:28,629 --> 00:27:31,333
<b>that he was making you suffer.</b>

438
00:27:32,168 --> 00:27:34,404
<b>Is that true?</b>

439
00:27:41,438 --> 00:27:45,253
<b>Yes, Eun Ho made me give him money...</b>

440
00:27:45,609 --> 00:27:47,353
<b>and said nasty things.</b>

441
00:27:48,149 --> 00:27:49,293
<b>Why...</b>

442
00:27:51,349 --> 00:27:52,823
<b>Why did you let him?</b>

443
00:27:53,718 --> 00:27:55,533
<b>Because Dong Myung had his back.</b>

444
00:27:55,819 --> 00:27:57,758
<b>So that's why you told your driver.</b>

445
00:27:57,758 --> 00:28:00,303
<b>He said he'd only scare him a little.</b>

446
00:28:00,829 --> 00:28:02,974
<b>It must've been scary for you.</b>

447
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:05,569
<b>You probably had no idea...</b>

448
00:28:05,569 --> 00:28:07,868
<b>what happened between Eun Ho and your driver.</b>

449
00:28:07,869 --> 00:28:10,243
<b>It must've been driving you insane.</b>

450
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:12,743
<b>However,</b>

451
00:28:13,268 --> 00:28:16,184
<b>you still don't seem at ease though.</b>

452
00:28:18,008 --> 00:28:19,124
<b>Min Sung,</b>

453
00:28:19,609 --> 00:28:21,978
<b>if you lie because it's easier...</b>

454
00:28:21,978 --> 00:28:24,379
<b>and less scary than telling the truth...</b>

455
00:28:24,379 --> 00:28:26,293
<b>What on earth are you saying?</b>

456
00:28:26,448 --> 00:28:28,724
<b>I'm sorry, but I must ask this.</b>

457
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:32,063
<b>Telling lies because it's easier...</b>

458
00:28:32,188 --> 00:28:34,258
<b>and less scary than telling the truth...</b>

459
00:28:34,258 --> 00:28:36,404
<b>will make you cross a bridge...</b>

460
00:28:37,698 --> 00:28:41,144
<b>that will only make your life harder.</b>

461
00:28:43,768 --> 00:28:44,843
<b>Please leave.</b>

462
00:28:46,569 --> 00:28:47,813
<b>Thank you anyway.</b>

463
00:28:48,109 --> 00:28:49,184
<b>You too, Mr. Lee.</b>

464
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:51,184
<b>Until next time then.</b>

465
00:28:51,309 --> 00:28:52,654
<b>It was me.</b>

466
00:28:54,379 --> 00:28:55,593
<b>It wasn't Dong Myung.</b>

467
00:28:59,049 --> 00:29:00,194
<b>I...</b>

468
00:29:01,488 --> 00:29:02,718
<b>did this to myself.</b>

469
00:29:02,718 --> 00:29:03,934
<b>Shut it!</b>

470
00:29:08,028 --> 00:29:09,934
<b>Thank you for telling me.</b>

471
00:29:25,178 --> 00:29:28,523

<b>Getting out alive...</b>

<b>could be a curse.</b>

669
00:45:57,039 --> 00:45:59,185
<b>Don't call it in. It's just a hassle.</b>

<b>Lee Young Sik. You're under arrest for attempted murder on Lee Sun Woo.</b>

<b>Do you think they arrested him by now?</b>

677
00:46:58,200 --> 00:46:59,415
<b>No way.</b>

678
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:02,970
<b>Or he was shot...</b>

679
00:47:02,970 --> 00:47:05,314
<b>for having an episode around an officer.</b>

680

<b>We should've killed him.</b>

685

<b>No.</b>

767

<b>But that person...</b>

768
00:52:43,050 --> 00:52:44,825
<b>wants to meet Eun Ho.</b>

00:54:05,830 --> 00:54:07,204
<b>You did well.</b>

789
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:15,675
<b>What's the matter?</b>

790
00:54:19,010 --> 00:54:21,214
<b>- I think I've found Jang Ki Ho. - What?</b>

791
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:22,885
<b>I just knew that...</b>

792
00:54:23,149 --> 00:54:26,024
<b>he'd be trying to get to Eun Ho.</b>

793
00:54:26,149 --> 00:54:28,694
<b>He sent someone to the school to look for the boy.</b>

794
00:54:28,879 --> 00:54:30,065
<b>And...</b>

795
00:54:30,719 --> 00:54:33,065
<b>he even left a phone number.</b>

796
00:54:35,889 --> 00:54:39,635
<b>All right. Let me now call that said number.</b>

797
00:54:40,229 --> 00:54:41,398
<b>Here we go.</b>

798
00:54:41,399 --> 00:54:45,744
<b>0, 1, 0, 4, 0, 3...</b>

799
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:48,974
<b>What? Do you recognize the number?</b>

800
00:54:49,310 --> 00:54:51,085
<b>I already have it saved on my phone.</b>

801
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:52,954
<b>Who does it belong to?</b>

802
00:55:02,179 --> 00:55:03,395
<b>Goodness.</b>

803
00:55:04,750 --> 00:55:05,895
<b>Sir.</b>

804
00:55:06,790 --> 00:55:09,060
<b>What do you mean it's a surprise?</b>

805
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:13,135
<b>Friends shouldn't have a reason to call each other.</b>

806
00:55:13,929 --> 00:55:16,845
<b>- Where are you at the moment? - The diner we last went to.</b>

807
00:55:17,369 --> 00:55:18,974
<b>Don't you need more money for the meal?</b>

808
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:20,675
<b>I'm sure it's running out.</b>

809
00:55:21,770 --> 00:55:23,208
<b>Well, I've been frugal.</b>

810
00:55:23,209 --> 00:55:25,784
<b>My gosh.</b>

811
00:55:26,639 --> 00:55:28,909
<b>I'll pay more than the amount I paid last time.</b>

812
00:55:28,909 --> 00:55:29,984
<b>Really?</b>

813
00:55:31,979 --> 00:55:33,425
<b>May you be blessed.</b>

814
00:55:34,550 --> 00:55:37,325
<b>Anyway, have you still...</b>

815
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:40,560
<b>not heard from Jang Ki Ho?</b>

816
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:43,365
<b>I'm afraid I have no updates.</b>

817
00:55:43,830 --> 00:55:46,375
<b>I see. All right.</b>

818
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:49,135
<b>Enjoy your dinner then.</b>

819
00:56:36,350 --> 00:56:40,355
<b>(Restricted Area)</b>

820
00:56:43,790 --> 00:56:45,964
<b>Let us check what you just said.</b>

821
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:48,964
<b>- We're good. - Sure.</b>

822
00:56:50,659 --> 00:56:53,575
<b>Kevin Jung was the mastermind. Is that correct?</b>

823
00:56:54,929 --> 00:56:56,175
<b>I want a verbal answer.</b>

824
00:56:56,899 --> 00:56:59,639
<b>- Yes. - He didn't tell you...</b>

825
00:56:59,639 --> 00:57:02,269
<b>how he found out that Eun Ho took the money.</b>

826
00:57:02,270 --> 00:57:05,244
<b>He ordered you to bring back the backpack,</b>

827
00:57:05,740 --> 00:57:08,815
<b>but after seeing that the money wasn't in it,</b>

828
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:11,454
<b>he ordered you to go after the boy.</b>

829
00:57:22,490 --> 00:57:24,935
<b>Kevin Jung introduced you to Choi Dae Hoon...</b>

830
00:57:25,030 --> 00:57:27,034
<b>and Choi Dae Hoon was hired to collect the money.</b>

831
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:28,405
<b>Where's the money?</b>

832
00:57:28,729 --> 00:57:30,605
<b>Where's the 30,000 dollars?</b>

833
00:57:30,729 --> 00:57:32,105
<b>Darn it.</b>

834
00:57:32,169 --> 00:57:34,145
<b>Getting greedy over money already?</b>

835
00:57:34,270 --> 00:57:35,444
<b>You punk.</b>

836
00:57:50,419 --> 00:57:51,724
<b>I'll ask you one last time.</b>

837
00:57:52,189 --> 00:57:53,534
<b>Where's the 30,000 dollars?</b>

838
00:57:54,189 --> 00:57:55,219
<b>Where is it?</b>

839
00:57:55,219 --> 00:57:57,304
<b>Tell me. Where is it?</b>

840
00:57:57,389 --> 00:57:59,335
<b>Where is it?</b>

841
00:58:01,459 --> 00:58:04,100
<b>Then Choi Dae Hoon drove his car...</b>

842
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:06,544
<b>and came to the derelict building?</b>

843
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:08,375
<b>Is that correct?</b>

844
00:58:10,510 --> 00:58:11,615
<b>Answer me verbally.</b>

845
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:13,954
<b>Yes.</b>

846
00:58:14,709 --> 00:58:15,709
<b>Things escalated,</b>

847
00:58:15,709 --> 00:58:18,355
<b>and Kevin Jung and Choi Dae Hoon began to fight.</b>

848
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:20,125
<b>To calm down,</b>

849
00:58:20,879 --> 00:58:23,464
<b>Choi Dae Hoon drank the beverage Kevin Jung brought...</b>

850
00:58:23,649 --> 00:58:25,565
<b>and lost consciousness.</b>

851
00:58:41,139 --> 00:58:42,214
<b>Move.</b>

852
00:58:45,610 --> 00:58:47,780
<b>You were too high two days ago...</b>

853
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:49,724
<b>to know where you were.</b>

854
00:58:49,810 --> 00:58:52,185
<b>Kevin Jung came by and you did heroin together.</b>

855
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:54,895
<b>Then you went to his house...</b>

856
00:58:55,250 --> 00:58:57,925
<b>and injected him with meth per his request.</b>

857
00:58:58,550 --> 00:59:00,219
<b>Before you knew it, Kevin Jung stopped breathing.</b>

858
00:59:00,219 --> 00:59:01,494
<b>Is that what happened?</b>

859
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:03,865
<b>Yes.</b>

860
00:59:14,070 --> 00:59:15,244
<b>What do you two think?</b>

861
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:18,744
<b>There's a critical error in his statement.</b>

862
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:21,655
<b>Yes, that Choi Dae Hoon drove his car at night.</b>

863
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:24,355
<b>- That's right. - So?</b>

864
00:59:25,679 --> 00:59:27,379
<b>It seems like Choi Dae Hoon was added...</b>

865
00:59:27,379 --> 00:59:29,125
<b>just to fit his made-up story.</b>

866
00:59:29,149 --> 00:59:30,889
<b>He knows what basically happened,</b>

867
00:59:30,889 --> 00:59:32,595
<b>but not the details.</b>

868
00:59:32,790 --> 00:59:35,020
<b>So the culprit is still out there?</b>

869
00:59:35,020 --> 00:59:36,659
<b>I don't know...</b>

870
00:59:36,659 --> 00:59:38,734
<b>if he could take the fall.</b>

871
00:59:38,959 --> 00:59:41,534
<b>Back at the building, he said he met the devil.</b>

872
00:59:43,229 --> 00:59:44,530
<b>Someone could be behind all this.</b>

873
00:59:44,530 --> 00:59:47,645
<b>Someone who knows the outlines of this case,</b>

874
00:59:48,070 --> 00:59:50,115
<b>but not about the fact that Choi Dae Hoon has night blindness.</b>

875
01:00:12,129 --> 01:00:13,429
<b>It seems like Choi Dae Hoon was added...</b>

876
01:00:13,429 --> 01:00:15,675
<b>just to fit his made-up story.</b>

877
01:00:16,129 --> 01:00:18,345
<b>"I'm the one who's making his life hard."</b>

878
01:00:18,830 --> 01:00:20,214
<b>That's what Eun Ho said.</b>

879
01:00:20,399 --> 01:00:23,345
<b>He said that he was the one who was making Min Sung suffer.</b>

880
01:00:23,969 --> 01:00:25,085
<b>Min Sung,</b>

881
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:27,014
<b>look at me.</b>

882
01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:43,889
<b>I'm Cha Young Jin of...</b>

883
01:00:43,889 --> 01:00:45,605
<b>Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency's Homicide Team One.</b>

884
01:00:46,959 --> 01:00:48,875
<b>Are you Min Sung's mother?</b>

885
01:00:49,129 --> 01:00:51,405
<b>The detective who came by today heard everything,</b>

886
01:00:51,869 --> 01:00:53,145
<b>so ask him.</b>

887
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:02,115
<b>What's wrong with you?</b>

888
01:01:02,610 --> 01:01:04,655
<b>Why are you hurting yourself?</b>

889
01:01:04,810 --> 01:01:06,425
<b>Just beat up others instead.</b>

890
01:01:06,820 --> 01:01:09,355
<b>It's better than being branded as a nutcase.</b>

891
01:01:12,790 --> 01:01:13,935
<b>Don't touch that.</b>

892
01:01:14,659 --> 01:01:17,435
<b>Nothing went smoothly since you were born.</b>

893
01:01:17,689 --> 01:01:20,229
<b>Do you have any idea how much we poured into your treatment?</b>

894
01:01:20,229 --> 01:01:21,804
<b>And we're only getting started.</b>

895
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:24,428
<b>Say something!</b>

896
01:01:24,429 --> 01:01:25,845
<b>I'll stop.</b>

897
01:01:27,939 --> 01:01:29,415
<b>I really will.</b>

898
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:31,244
<b>Darn it!</b>

899
01:02:10,679 --> 01:02:12,554
<b>Are you in the bathroom?</b>

900
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:29,774
<b>A friend of Eun Ho's brought it by.</b>

901
01:02:33,270 --> 01:02:35,375
<b>- Sleep well then. - Thanks.</b>

902
01:02:47,479 --> 01:02:51,694
<b>For those who believe</b>

903
01:02:51,919 --> 01:02:56,095
<b>The Lord spoke</b>

904
01:02:57,030 --> 01:03:01,704
<b>In a few days</b>

905
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:06,845
<b>We will meet after crossing the Jordan River</b>

906
01:03:07,369 --> 01:03:11,645
<b>In a few days</b>

907
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:55,494
<b>Ki Ho, it's me.</b>

908
01:03:55,750 --> 01:03:56,925
<b>Open up.</b>

909
01:04:19,780 --> 01:04:22,014
<b>Who are you? Show yourself.</b>

910
01:04:23,649 --> 01:04:25,010
<b>It's me, Baek Sang Ho.</b>

911
01:04:25,010 --> 01:04:26,979
<b>Gosh, I almost had a heart attack.</b>

912
01:04:26,979 --> 01:04:29,050
<b>Why did you startle me like that?</b>

913
01:04:29,050 --> 01:04:31,565
<b>You startled me as well.</b>

914
01:04:31,750 --> 01:04:35,260
<b>I can't believe you were secretly hiding Jang Ki Ho here.</b>

915
01:04:35,260 --> 01:04:38,034
<b>Wait. Let me explain.</b>

916
01:04:38,429 --> 01:04:40,474
<b>- Take him away. - Hey, listen to me.</b>

917
01:05:45,930 --> 01:05:47,235
<b>Ki Ho.</b>

918
01:05:54,899 --> 01:06:02,384
<b>(Nobody Knows)</b>

919
01:06:02,740 --> 01:06:05,309
<b>Ki Ho, it's been so long.</b>

920
01:06:05,309 --> 01:06:07,720
<b>I was going to tell you at the right time.</b>

921
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:09,550
<b>You went to New Life Church for a long time, right?</b>

922
01:06:09,550 --> 01:06:11,090
<b>I'm guessing you know Jang Ki Ho.</b>

923
01:06:11,090 --> 01:06:13,220
<b>You should ask Sun Woo.</b>

924
01:06:13,220 --> 01:06:14,590
<b>Why does he need to get transferred?</b>

925
01:06:14,590 --> 01:06:15,689
<b>He did nothing wrong!</b>

926
01:06:15,689 --> 01:06:16,789
<b>Mr. Lee!</b>

927
01:06:16,789 --> 01:06:18,729
<b>Jang Ki Ho gave something to Eun Ho.</b>

928
01:06:18,729 --> 01:06:20,599
<b>And his bag disappeared after that.</b>

929
01:06:20,599 --> 01:06:22,700
<b>That means someone's looking for what Jang Ki Ho gave him.</b>

930
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:25,099
<b>The person who's after that is probably the one...</b>

931
01:06:25,099 --> 01:06:26,300
<b>who's behind all this.</b>

932
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:27,744
<b>Poor thing.</b>

933
01:06:28,039 --> 01:06:29,244
<b>Do you want me to kill you?</b>

934
01:06:29,269 --> 01:06:32,215
<b>Tell me everything you know about Jang Ki Ho.</b>

935
01:06:32,809 --> 01:06:35,215
<b>Han Sol! Han Sol!</b>

936
01:06:35,379 --> 01:06:36,485
<b>Where are you?</b>

937
01:06:36,809 --> 01:06:38,954
<b>Was it because of Dong Myung?</b>

938
01:06:39,149 --> 01:06:41,025
<b>Or was there something else?</b>
