<b>EPISODE 9</b>

5
00:00:16,853 --> 00:00:18,980
<b>This is the right address.</b>

6
00:00:20,148 --> 00:00:22,317
<b>I think it was set here on purpose.</b>

7
00:00:22,817 --> 00:00:26,654
<b>If she's being this thorough about hiding,
it'll take some time to find her.</b>

8
00:00:27,697 --> 00:00:29,157
<b>This made me confirm two things.</b>

9
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,868
<b>One is that Song Jeong-hye
is with Lee Lim,</b>

10
00:00:33,078 --> 00:00:34,829
<b>and the other is that
even though it's work,</b>

11
00:00:35,205 --> 00:00:36,706
<b>it's nice to go somewhere far with you.</b>

12
00:00:37,457 --> 00:00:38,458
<b>Wherever it is.</b>

13
00:00:41,419 --> 00:00:43,463
<b>Do you get tutored
to learn phrases like that?</b>

14
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:46,299
<b>Surprisingly, I taught myself.</b>

15
00:00:48,468 --> 00:00:49,719
<b>I guess this is why everyone...</b>

16
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:55,391
<b>Everyone commits treason?</b>

17
00:00:56,059 --> 00:00:57,602
<b>Are you mad?</b>

18
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:00,563
<b>Do you think doing that is okay?</b>

19
00:01:01,147 --> 00:01:03,525
<b>I mean, it's why everyone
in the palace loves you.</b>

20
00:01:04,025 --> 00:01:05,985
<b>You know how to joke
in difficult situations.</b>

21
00:01:07,612 --> 00:01:10,198
<b>I shouldn't have begun saying that.
We don't have time.</b>

22
00:01:11,157 --> 00:01:12,242
<b>That's what I was thinking.</b>

23
00:01:14,452 --> 00:01:15,662
<b>You thought of a lot of things</b>

24
00:01:16,454 --> 00:01:17,580
<b>in a short time.</b>

25
00:01:18,706 --> 00:01:19,916
<b>Why would you make a joke like that?</b>

26
00:01:19,999 --> 00:01:21,835
<b>It's a joke only I can make.</b>

27
00:01:23,378 --> 00:01:25,880
<b>I'm sorry.
I didn't know you'd be so startled.</b>

28
00:01:28,967 --> 00:01:31,302
<b>I don't even know how to comfort you.</b>

29
00:01:33,012 --> 00:01:34,764
<b>There's a person I like,</b>

30
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:38,309
<b>but his past is so dramatic.
He's a victim of treason.</b>

31
00:01:42,522 --> 00:01:44,899
<b>Your earth is still flat.</b>

32
00:01:44,983 --> 00:01:48,736
<b>Yes, it's as flat as a thin pancake.</b>

33
00:01:59,205 --> 00:02:00,832
<b>I guess you were troubled</b>

34
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:03,209
<b>since Song Jeong-hye</b>

35
00:02:04,794 --> 00:02:07,005
<b>will have the face of my mother,</b>

36
00:02:07,755 --> 00:02:08,756
<b>right?</b>

37
00:02:11,885 --> 00:02:15,722
<b>I thought that maybe
you'd want to see her.</b>

38
00:02:18,308 --> 00:02:19,559
<b>Not at all.</b>

39
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,937
<b>Like how Yeong and Eun-sup are
different people,</b>

40
00:02:24,522 --> 00:02:26,191
<b>she is not my mother either.</b>

41
00:02:27,442 --> 00:02:30,069
<b>The face is just a symbol of a person.</b>

42
00:02:32,864 --> 00:02:34,199
<b>Then let me ask just one question.</b>

43
00:02:36,826 --> 00:02:39,370
<b>How do you go back and forth
between the two worlds?</b>

44
00:02:40,038 --> 00:02:41,706
<b>Both you and Lee Lim.</b>

45
00:02:48,338 --> 00:02:50,298
<b>I've answered all your questions
until now,</b>

46
00:02:50,715 --> 00:02:51,883
<b>and I will continue to do so.</b>

47
00:02:52,383 --> 00:02:53,343
<b>Except for that question</b>

48
00:02:54,052 --> 00:02:55,386
<b>you just asked.</b>

49
00:02:59,557 --> 00:03:00,516
<b>All right.</b>

50
00:03:02,602 --> 00:03:05,104
<b>Then it's really true
that it's your first time dating?</b>

51
00:03:05,188 --> 00:03:06,272
<b>That one's an exception too.</b>

52
00:03:07,941 --> 00:03:08,816
<b>Shall we go now?</b>

53
00:03:09,776 --> 00:03:11,444
<b>It's suddenly getting cold,
don't you think?</b>

54
00:03:12,153 --> 00:03:14,822
<b>In this world, we say that men
should always keep their word.</b>

55
00:03:14,906 --> 00:03:16,199
<b>Don't you say that in yours?</b>

56
00:03:16,282 --> 00:03:18,243
<b>Oh, do you say that here?</b>

57
00:03:23,706 --> 00:03:25,667
<b>Who's the girl you made
steak and rice for?</b>

58
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:27,919
<b>I thought you had one question.</b>

59
00:03:28,002 --> 00:03:29,712
<b>You didn't even answer
one question so far.</b>

60
00:03:31,047 --> 00:03:32,298
<b>I attended the Naval Academy.</b>

61
00:03:32,924 --> 00:03:34,259
<b>You're the only woman in my life.</b>

62
00:03:35,343 --> 00:03:36,761
<b>You have quite a wit.</b>

63
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,973
<b>I see that you don't.</b>

64
00:03:47,397 --> 00:03:49,649
<b>You looked good in the navy uniform.</b>

65
00:03:50,525 --> 00:03:51,651
<b>Why are you holding my hand?</b>

66
00:03:52,694 --> 00:03:54,779
<b>Did you make steak and rice
for Koo Seo-ryeong or not?</b>

67
00:03:55,196 --> 00:03:57,365
<b>You didn't prepare
the rice in that uniform, did you?</b>

68
00:04:05,832 --> 00:04:07,208
<b>I barely made it on time.</b>

69
00:04:08,793 --> 00:04:10,712
<b>Listen carefully, and keep this in mind.</b>

70
00:04:12,297 --> 00:04:14,173
<b>I eat bread from this bakery
every morning.</b>

71
00:04:14,257 --> 00:04:17,885
<b>The bread here tastes exactly
like the bread at the Royal Court.</b>

72
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,388
<b>Why would I need to keep that in mind?</b>

73
00:04:25,768 --> 00:04:27,979
<b>I'm a busy person.
Why did you bring me here?</b>

74
00:04:28,062 --> 00:04:30,398
<b>You spread the jam pretty thoroughly
for a busy person.</b>

75
00:04:30,565 --> 00:04:31,774
<b>Bread should be eaten with jam.</b>

76
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,443
<b>So why am I here?</b>

77
00:04:38,197 --> 00:04:40,366
<b>Keep in mind that it tastes
great without jam as well.</b>

78
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,994
<b>And what I'm about to say now
is even more important.</b>

79
00:04:45,455 --> 00:04:46,622
<b>From now on,</b>

80

<b>you must be the real Unbreakable Sword.</b>

81
00:04:51,627 --> 00:04:53,379
<b>You must've lost your mind.</b>

82
00:04:54,922 --> 00:04:55,965
<b>Can you turn around a bit?</b>

83
00:04:57,884 --> 00:04:59,177
<b>That looks like Yeong's coat.</b>

84
00:04:59,927 --> 00:05:01,054
<b>100 percent cashmere.</b>

85
00:05:04,265 --> 00:05:05,433
<b>The Unbreakable Sword?</b>

86
00:05:06,851 --> 00:05:07,769
<b>I will do as you order.</b>

87
00:05:08,895 --> 00:05:11,356
<b>I didn't want to brag about myself,</b>

88
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:14,442
<b>but I'm actually skilled at dealing with
problems at the Public Service Center.</b>

89
00:05:15,109 --> 00:05:16,235
<b>What should I do first, Your Majesty?</b>

90
00:05:19,947 --> 00:05:20,782
<b>You're here.</b>

91
00:05:21,741 --> 00:05:22,617
<b>Did you eat dinner?</b>

92
00:05:23,117 --> 00:05:26,287
<b>I sent you a lot of clothes.
Why did you come wearing that?</b>

93
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:27,955
<b>Don't waste your money.</b>

94
00:05:28,831 --> 00:05:31,209
<b>I didn't wear expensive clothes
even when we had rich in-laws.</b>

95
00:05:31,292 --> 00:05:32,543
<b>That's a really long time ago.</b>

96
00:05:33,836 --> 00:05:34,754
<b>You're right.</b>

97
00:05:35,797 --> 00:05:38,132
<b>I brought some boiled fish.</b>

98
00:05:39,384 --> 00:05:42,053
<b>Why don't you have just one bite with me?</b>

99
00:05:42,136 --> 00:05:44,305
<b>How can I eat at this hour?</b>

100
00:05:49,685 --> 00:05:50,853
<b>Just one bite, then.</b>

101
00:05:54,982 --> 00:05:55,817
<b>But Mom.</b>

102
00:05:56,526 --> 00:05:58,319
<b>You really didn't send me that newspaper?</b>

103
00:05:59,112 --> 00:06:00,947
<b>It's salty. Eat that with rice.</b>

104
00:06:02,073 --> 00:06:05,076
<b>And I really didn't send it.
What kind of newspaper was it?</b>

105
00:06:06,994 --> 00:06:08,079
<b>Never mind.</b>

106
00:06:08,663 --> 00:06:10,081
<b>I guess my secretary made a mistake.</b>

107
00:06:10,706 --> 00:06:12,208
<b>Lots of stuff gets sent to my office.</b>

108
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,378
<b>Is everything okay at home?</b>

109
00:06:15,461 --> 00:06:17,004
<b>It's always the same, you know.</b>

110
00:06:20,049 --> 00:06:21,217
<b>By the way...</b>

111
00:06:21,926 --> 00:06:23,678
<b>About that dead Lee Lim...</b>

112
00:06:26,013 --> 00:06:27,598
<b>Did he have a hidden child or something?</b>

113
00:06:27,682 --> 00:06:29,767
<b>Don't be ridiculous.</b>

114
00:06:29,851 --> 00:06:32,895
<b>He died the year after he committed
treason without an heir.</b>

115
00:06:32,979 --> 00:06:33,855
<b>Right?</b>

116
00:06:35,606 --> 00:06:38,484
<b>But the customer who left the umbrella
at the store</b>

117
00:06:38,568 --> 00:06:40,695
<b>came to get it a few days ago.</b>

118
00:06:41,863 --> 00:06:44,699
<b>He looked just like Lee Lim
when he was alive.</b>

119
00:06:44,782 --> 00:06:45,616
<b>So I thought</b>

120
00:06:46,451 --> 00:06:48,786
<b>maybe he had a son.</b>

121
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:53,166
<b>Mom, you'll get in huge trouble
if you say things like that.</b>

<b>The King doesn't have an heir yet.</b>

<b>Didn't he go to work?
Why are you looking for him here?</b>

619
00:41:41,753 --> 00:41:42,921
<b>That's classified information.</b>

620
00:41:44,255 --> 00:41:46,883
<b>Just call me if he comes here.</b>

621
00:41:47,467 --> 00:41:49,010
<b>Okay. But Tae-eul,</b>

622
00:41:50,553 --> 00:41:51,429
<b>isn't Eun-sup</b>

623
00:41:53,014 --> 00:41:54,057
<b>acting strange these days?</b>

624
00:41:59,688 --> 00:42:01,231
<b>Eun-sup? Why?</b>

625
00:42:01,314 --> 00:42:03,358
<b>I didn't notice anything weird.</b>

626
00:42:03,441 --> 00:42:04,317
<b>It feels like</b>

627
00:42:05,068 --> 00:42:06,945
<b>he's not as handsome as before.</b>

628
00:42:07,737 --> 00:42:09,030
<b>He looks a bit lame.</b>

629
00:42:10,115 --> 00:42:11,825
<b>What's up with his hair?</b>

630
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,080
<b>You really have a strange taste.</b>

631
00:42:23,128 --> 00:42:25,213
<b>Let's meet at the hotel from now on.</b>

632
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:29,300
<b>Na-ri and Eun-sup are going to
fall apart at this rate.</b>

633
00:42:30,552 --> 00:42:31,386
<b>What do you want?</b>

634
00:42:35,682 --> 00:42:36,850
<b>Can you sell this for me?</b>

635
00:42:37,017 --> 00:42:38,977
<b>I heard you know a decent place
that pays you well.</b>

636
00:42:42,605 --> 00:42:43,690
<b>Yeah, I do.</b>

637
00:42:45,275 --> 00:42:49,070
<b>I've been selling so much stuff
that the owner thinks I'm a corrupt cop.</b>

638
00:42:50,321 --> 00:42:54,784
<b>Anyway, I'll sell this for you,
so let me use the hotel room too.</b>

639
00:42:55,493 --> 00:42:57,704
<b>-I need a place of my own.
-His Majesty isn't in there...</b>

640
00:42:57,787 --> 00:42:58,747
<b>You're here.</b>

641
00:42:59,914 --> 00:43:03,501
<b>But what do you want to get
with the money from selling this?</b>

642
00:43:04,711 --> 00:43:05,879
<b>I need revenue</b>

643
00:43:06,713 --> 00:43:08,006
<b>to gain mobility.</b>

644
00:43:14,054 --> 00:43:15,055
<b>DRIVING TEST VEHICLE</b>

645
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:19,100
<i><b>The driving test will begin now.</i></b>

646
00:43:19,559 --> 00:43:21,936
<i><b>-You don't have a license?
-Congratulations. You have passed.</i></b>

647
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:24,564
<b>SOCIAL SECURITY CARD
DRIVER'S LICENSE</b>

648
00:43:25,148 --> 00:43:26,816
<b>I took the test.</b>

649
00:43:27,025 --> 00:43:29,194
<b>I usually pass any kind of test I take.</b>

650
00:43:29,694 --> 00:43:30,862
<b>I got perfect scores on CSAT.</b>

651
00:43:30,945 --> 00:43:32,447
<b>I don't know what that is,</b>

652
00:43:32,781 --> 00:43:34,949
<b>but why don't you have a license
when you took the test?</b>

653
00:43:35,533 --> 00:43:37,035
<b>Because I couldn't turn right or left.</b>

654
00:43:38,244 --> 00:43:39,829
<b>A man should always go straight.</b>

655
00:43:42,165 --> 00:43:43,249
<b>I have a good enough reason.</b>

656
00:43:44,292 --> 00:43:47,504
<b>But why are you trying to go
when you can't even turn left or right?</b>

657
00:43:47,754 --> 00:43:50,298
<b>If you're thinking of it as
an overseas trip, you better stop.</b>

658
00:43:50,381 --> 00:43:51,841
<b>You'll get caught when you open...</b>

659
00:43:56,096 --> 00:43:57,722
<b>Should I just rip your throat?</b>

660
00:43:58,389 --> 00:43:59,682
<b>If you lose your voice...</b>

661
00:43:59,766 --> 00:44:00,600
<b>Hey!</b>

662
00:44:04,979 --> 00:44:05,814
<b>Hey.</b>

663
00:44:06,815 --> 00:44:08,691
<b>I know you care about King Arthur,</b>

664
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:10,902
<b>but you won't be as sincere as I am
for my siblings.</b>

665
00:44:14,197 --> 00:44:15,698
<b>Well, King Arthur told me</b>

666
00:44:17,992 --> 00:44:19,953
<b>that this is how
I can protect my siblings.</b>

667
00:44:25,375 --> 00:44:28,002
<b>Are you doing well, Jo Eun-sup?</b>

668
00:44:32,132 --> 00:44:34,175
<b>If we're to maintain the budget
for education,</b>

669
00:44:34,509 --> 00:44:36,761
<b>we need drastic changes
for the medical sector.</b>

670
00:44:41,808 --> 00:44:43,059
<b>Do we really need to choose one?</b>

671
00:44:43,143 --> 00:44:45,353
<b>The department is stating that
we need to lower the welfare budget</b>

672
00:44:45,436 --> 00:44:48,273
<b>and increase the budget for
factors such as technology and service.</b>

673
00:44:49,107 --> 00:44:50,024
<b>For national interest.</b>

674
00:44:50,108 --> 00:44:53,444
<b>Medical service and education
are the people's rights, not benefits.</b>

675
00:44:54,362 --> 00:44:55,363
<b>Let's move on.</b>

676
00:44:58,116 --> 00:44:59,576
<b>There's a supplementary budget</b>

677
00:44:59,659 --> 00:45:01,953
<b>of 5.2 trillion won for restoring
the disaster area.</b>

678
00:45:02,036 --> 00:45:04,122
<b>Yes, it's been designated
as a special disaster zone</b>

679
00:45:04,330 --> 00:45:07,333
<b>and we're doing our best to restore
and help people to live their daily lives.</b>

680
00:45:07,709 --> 00:45:08,668
<b>Great.</b>

681
00:45:11,421 --> 00:45:14,757
<b>Did that traveler return safely?</b>

682
00:45:14,841 --> 00:45:16,050
<b>Is work boring?</b>

683
00:45:19,012 --> 00:45:21,681
<b>She returned to her daily life.</b>

684
00:45:28,271 --> 00:45:30,607
<b>DONGNAE PENITENTIARY</b>

685
00:45:32,692 --> 00:45:34,944
<b>I hope she had a good time
in the Kingdom of Corea.</b>

686
00:45:42,202 --> 00:45:44,454
<b>I'm much more productive
after I eat something spicy.</b>

687
00:45:44,871 --> 00:45:45,830
<b>I work faster, too.</b>

688
00:45:47,582 --> 00:45:48,917
<b>Yeong, let's eat.</b>

689
00:45:53,755 --> 00:45:56,007
<b>Wow, how can you sweet potatoes
for every meal?</b>

690
00:45:59,427 --> 00:46:00,762
<b>Effort never betrays you.</b>

691
00:46:03,514 --> 00:46:05,391
<b>You need kimchi with sweet potatoes.</b>

692
00:46:05,892 --> 00:46:08,478
<b>DELICIOUS KIMCHI</b>

693
00:46:13,441 --> 00:46:14,817
<b>Do you know about this combination?</b>

694
00:46:16,277 --> 00:46:18,071
<b>Head Court Lady Noh
always gave these to me.</b>

695
00:46:23,785 --> 00:46:24,911
<b>It's really tasty.</b>

696
00:46:26,162 --> 00:46:27,038
<b>Yeong.</b>

697
00:46:27,789 --> 00:46:28,915
<b>Let's hurry up and eat.</b>

698
00:46:30,041 --> 00:46:31,125
<b>Yes, Your Majesty.</b>

699
00:46:33,378 --> 00:46:34,712
<b>Why aren't you eating?</b>

700
00:46:35,338 --> 00:46:37,423
<b>I'll gain weight
if I eat three times a day.</b>

701
00:46:38,132 --> 00:46:39,717
<b>Aren't you getting married, Your Majesty?</b>

702
00:46:41,844 --> 00:46:43,513
<b>That was a rather random question.</b>

703
00:46:44,097 --> 00:46:44,931
<b>Why?</b>

704
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:47,892
<b>-Do you want to marry me?
-Can I?</b>

705
00:46:48,476 --> 00:46:49,394
<b>No.</b>

706
00:46:49,894 --> 00:46:51,896
<b>I already proposed to someone else.</b>

707
00:46:53,564 --> 00:46:54,983
<b>What's the next agenda?</b>

708
00:46:56,276 --> 00:46:57,360
<i><b>Wow.</i></b>

709
00:46:57,443 --> 00:46:59,362
<i><b>This world is very aggressive.</i></b>

710
00:47:03,449 --> 00:47:05,285
<b>I told you, we're closed for today.</b>

711
00:47:05,368 --> 00:47:07,036
<b>You need to make an appointment first.</b>

712
00:47:07,453 --> 00:47:09,580
<b>He's here for me. You can go home now.</b>

713
00:47:10,164 --> 00:47:10,999
<b>All right.</b>

714
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:17,046
<b>I guess the sweets aren't helping.</b>

715
00:47:18,006 --> 00:47:20,383
<b>Or have you just realized
that they don't help?</b>

716
00:47:21,050 --> 00:47:22,010
<b>Have a seat.</b>

717
00:47:22,510 --> 00:47:24,595
<b>I want to get some sleep.</b>

718
00:47:25,930 --> 00:47:27,181
<b>Can I get a prescription?</b>

719
00:47:27,265 --> 00:47:28,891
<b>Not without an examination.</b>

720
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:31,144
<b>Don't turn me into a real quack
and just sit down.</b>

721
00:47:31,644 --> 00:47:34,605
<b>I'm not the type that goes on
about your subconscious or whatever,</b>

722
00:47:34,689 --> 00:47:35,940
<b>so don't worry.</b>

723
00:47:37,358 --> 00:47:40,403
<b>I believe a quick diagnosis
and the right medication is better.</b>

724
00:47:40,486 --> 00:47:41,446
<b>Like a cold.</b>

725
00:47:42,447 --> 00:47:44,198
<b>Can't you just introduce me to a quack?</b>

726
00:47:44,907 --> 00:47:46,701
<b>I came here because
even alcohol isn't helping.</b>

727
00:47:46,784 --> 00:47:47,869
<b>Are you sure?</b>

728
00:47:48,578 --> 00:47:49,954
<b>Maybe you just didn't drink enough.</b>

729
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:54,459
<b>Are you sure you're a real doctor?</b>

730
00:47:58,921 --> 00:48:00,256
<b>Wow.</b>

731
00:48:00,798 --> 00:48:01,799
<b>This is amazing.</b>

732
00:48:13,144 --> 00:48:13,978
<b>Wow.</b>

733
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:33,456
<b>Eun-sup?</b>

734
00:48:36,334 --> 00:48:37,210
<b>Take that off.</b>

735
00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:39,879
<b>The King never shares his belongings
with other people.</b>

736
00:48:41,631 --> 00:48:43,216
<b>Damn, you're so cheap.</b>

737
00:48:43,508 --> 00:48:45,051
<b>I wanted to get some skincare, too.</b>

738
00:48:49,597 --> 00:48:50,431
<b>By the way,</b>

739
00:48:51,724 --> 00:48:53,643
<b>how did you unlock Yeong's cell phone?</b>

740
00:48:56,729 --> 00:48:57,605
<b>Like this.</b>

741
00:49:02,068 --> 00:49:04,529
<b>Have you still not unlocked his laptop?</b>

742
00:49:04,695 --> 00:49:05,947
<b>Should I give it a try?</b>

743
00:49:07,448 --> 00:49:08,908
<b>I appreciate your sense of challenge.</b>

744
00:49:09,409 --> 00:49:12,120
<b>But security in the Royal Court
isn't something that simple.</b>

745
00:49:13,037 --> 00:49:14,330
<b>Wake me if you do unlock it.</b>

746
00:49:14,831 --> 00:49:16,040
<b>Then I'll give you one too.</b>

747
00:49:16,582 --> 00:49:18,501
<b>This is a special skincare product</b>

<b>made especially for the King.</b>

749
00:49:35,268 --> 00:49:36,310
<b>I unlocked it.</b>

750
00:49:41,023 --> 00:49:42,608
<i><b>J, and then 13 zeros.</i></b>

751
00:49:42,692 --> 00:49:45,111
<i><b>One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight,</i></b>

752
00:49:45,194 --> 00:49:47,989
<i><b>nine, ten, eleven, twelve.
And another zero.</i></b>

753
00:49:48,072 --> 00:49:49,740
<i><b>"Jo" as in trillion,
and "Yeong" as in zero.</i></b>

754
00:51:27,129 --> 00:51:29,966
<b>We didn't take any photos together.</b>

755
00:51:33,928 --> 00:51:35,471
<i><b>It's too cold outside now.</i></b>

756
00:51:36,514 --> 00:51:37,890
<b>You should grow here from now on.</b>

757
00:51:39,016 --> 00:51:39,934
<b>What did you plant?</b>

758
00:51:41,435 --> 00:51:42,937
<b>Seeds I got from your world.</b>

759
00:51:43,854 --> 00:51:44,939
<b>But it's not sprouting.</b>

760
00:51:45,898 --> 00:51:46,941
<b>Is it being shy?</b>

761
00:51:50,444 --> 00:51:51,445
<b>Listen up.</b>

762
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:53,239
<b>I am your King.</b>

763
00:51:54,365 --> 00:51:56,033

<b>Didn't they sprout?</b>

770

<b>There's no wind, sunlight, or time there.</b>

772

<b>I was just asking.</b>

773
00:52:34,655 --> 00:52:36,157
<b>Did you try going to the edge?</b>

774
00:52:36,907 --> 00:52:40,036
<b>I tried to, but I couldn't reach the edge.</b>

775
00:52:40,661 --> 00:52:42,079
<b>I shouldn't stay there long.</b>

776
00:52:42,663 --> 00:52:43,956
<b>Even if I spend one day in there,</b>

777

<b>two months flow by outside.</b>

778
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:48,294

780

<b>Hang on.</b>

781
00:52:56,844 --> 00:52:58,679
<b>Then I could actually be older than you.</b>

782
00:53:00,139 --> 00:53:03,225
<b>No wonder. You seemed to be
getting younger these days.</b>

783

794

<b>Don't ask me to come with you.</b>

795

<b>What about this world?</b>

796
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:05,621
<b>What about my dad?</b>

797
00:54:05,955 --> 00:54:06,831
<b>And Na-ri,</b>

798

799

800
00:54:17,883 --> 00:54:18,718

801
00:54:19,343 --> 00:54:21,595
<b>-Did you just stop me from talking?
-No, I stopped myself.</b>

810
00:56:31,016 --> 00:56:32,226

818
00:57:29,033 --> 00:57:31,368
<b>Did you retrieve the cell phone?</b>

819
00:57:33,203 --> 00:57:34,288

822

<b>It's a bitch named Jeong Tae-eul.</b>

825
00:57:54,642 --> 00:57:57,311
<b>I looked into it,

826
00:57:58,312 --> 00:57:59,688

832

<b>Should I just bury them both somewhere?</b>

833
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,428

836
00:58:40,771 --> 00:58:44,358

837

<b>That bookstore you asked me

845

852
01:00:00,392 --> 01:00:02,019
<b>Yes. I'm waiting for a delivery.</b>

853

<b>If there's anything you're looking for,

<b>Oh, it's all right.</b>

855
01:00:06,690 --> 01:00:11,278
<b>I was just thinking of looking
at medical books if you have any.</b>

856
01:00:12,571 --> 01:00:14,406
<b>We don't have medical books here.</b>

857
01:00:14,615 --> 01:00:16,033
<b>Nobody comes looking for them.</b>

858
01:00:16,116 --> 01:00:17,409
<b>Oh, I see.</b>

859
01:00:19,745 --> 01:00:20,579
<b>But</b>

860
01:00:21,663 --> 01:00:24,541
<b>have we met before?</b>

861
01:00:32,216 --> 01:00:33,759
<b>I've seen you.</b>

862
01:00:34,885 --> 01:00:36,261
<b>You're a member of the royal family.</b>

863
01:00:37,971 --> 01:00:39,973
<b>Sometimes I forget that.</b>

864
01:00:40,516 --> 01:00:41,934
<b>Sorry for the trouble.</b>

865
01:01:08,335 --> 01:01:12,339
<b>You come here every year
without telling me in advance.</b>

866
01:01:12,422 --> 01:01:17,261
<b>Because you're here every year

867
01:01:20,681 --> 01:01:22,808
<b>Have you found any answers yet?</b>

868
01:01:23,433 --> 01:01:24,977
<b>I found a symbol,</b>

871

<b>You've always done so.</b>

872
01:01:35,279 --> 01:01:36,405
<b>Uncle,</b>

873
01:01:38,157 --> 01:01:39,741
<b>do you believe in fate?</b>

874
01:01:43,245 --> 01:01:46,540
<b>It's a hard concept
for a math and science person.</b>

875
01:01:47,666 --> 01:01:48,917
<b>It's not something clear.</b>

876
01:01:49,585 --> 01:01:53,839
<b>People usually tell fate to move aside
and challenge it.</b>

877
01:01:56,633 --> 01:01:57,885
<b>Should I fight against it?</b>

878
01:01:58,677 --> 01:02:01,972
<b>You can never know
what will happen in life.</b>

879
01:02:03,182 --> 01:02:05,350
<b>But if there is a place you want to reach</b>

880
01:02:06,059 --> 01:02:07,394
<b>even if</b>

881
01:02:08,187 --> 01:02:10,439
<b>your life may be at risk,</b>

882
01:02:10,689 --> 01:02:12,608
<b>that is fate.</b>

883
01:02:13,525 --> 01:02:16,153
<b>The footsteps you take</b>

884
01:02:18,071 --> 01:02:23,368
<b>by risking your whole life is what's fate.</b>

885
01:02:28,081 --> 01:02:30,918
<b>Is there a place you want to reach?</b>

886
01:02:32,628 --> 01:02:33,503
<b>Yes.</b>

887
01:02:34,046 --> 01:02:34,963
<b>There is.</b>

888
01:02:35,214 --> 01:02:38,717
<b>Then you just have to go there.
You don't need to fight.</b>

889
01:02:39,801 --> 01:02:42,971
<b>I hope there is a beautiful lady there.</b>

890
01:02:44,389 --> 01:02:46,725
<b>You should really get married this year.</b>

891
01:02:48,602 --> 01:02:49,853
<b>If I find the solution,</b>

892
01:02:51,396 --> 01:02:55,984
<b>I will visit you again with a woman
who argues that the earth is flat.</b>

893

894
01:02:57,110 --> 01:02:58,987
