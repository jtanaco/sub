<b>(Episode 14)</b>

2
00:00:29,403 --> 00:00:30,549
<b>Stop.</b>

3
00:00:33,873 --> 00:00:35,058
<b>What are you doing?</b>

4
00:00:35,843 --> 00:00:37,929
<b>These are the belongings of the beheaded men.</b>

5
00:00:38,184 --> 00:00:39,354
<b>We were told to keep what's useful...</b>

6
00:00:39,354 --> 00:00:40,689
<b>and burn the rest.</b>

7
00:00:55,064 --> 00:00:56,939
<b>Don't burn the belongings of the dead.</b>

8
00:00:58,733 --> 00:00:59,878
<b>I want you to gather all of them.</b>

9
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:28,579
<b>Give these to the men who survived...</b>

10
00:01:28,933 --> 00:01:30,908
<b>so they can use what's left to hold a funeral.</b>

11
00:01:33,904 --> 00:01:35,018
<b>Wait.</b>

12
00:01:48,784 --> 00:01:49,928
<b>I will kill you.</b>

13
00:01:51,754 --> 00:01:53,398
<b>I will kill you...</b>

14
00:01:54,963 --> 00:01:56,038
<b>at all costs.</b>

15
00:03:19,274 --> 00:03:20,349
<b>Chan Seong!</b>

16
00:03:27,584 --> 00:03:29,428
<b>I thought you weren't coming back.</b>

17
00:04:07,054 --> 00:04:08,169
<b>Who...</b>

18
00:04:12,434 --> 00:04:13,569
<b>are you?</b>

19
00:04:22,144 --> 00:04:23,219
<b>Mr. Ku!</b>

20
00:04:23,803 --> 00:04:25,318
<b>- Mr. Ku! - Mr. Ku!</b>

21
00:04:25,944 --> 00:04:27,019
<b>Mr. Ku!</b>

22
00:04:33,654 --> 00:04:35,029
<b>Thank goodness you're okay.</b>

23
00:04:35,753 --> 00:04:37,399
<b>We were really worried.</b>

24
00:04:37,954 --> 00:04:39,169
<b>I was so flustered.</b>

25
00:04:49,563 --> 00:04:51,178
<b>Ms. Jang, you must've been really startled.</b>

26
00:04:51,634 --> 00:04:52,779
<b>Do you feel unwell?</b>

27
00:04:55,344 --> 00:04:56,419
<b>No, I'm fine.</b>

28
00:05:01,714 --> 00:05:04,459
<b>I'm okay. I must've startled you a lot.</b>

29
00:05:13,053 --> 00:05:14,998
<b>Ms. Jang must be angry.</b>

30
00:05:15,194 --> 00:05:18,039
<b>She's probably just embarrassed that she ran over here all startled.</b>

31
00:05:18,993 --> 00:05:21,979
<b>Anyway, I'm relieved that you managed to find your way out.</b>

32
00:06:02,474 --> 00:06:03,578
<b>This is...</b>

33
00:06:05,113 --> 00:06:06,888
<b>the end for us.</b>

34
00:06:12,584 --> 00:06:13,789
<b>Who is that man?</b>

35
00:06:14,483 --> 00:06:16,399
<b>Why? Do you think it could be you?</b>

36
00:06:16,784 --> 00:06:18,529
<b>I thought that could be a possibility.</b>

37
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:19,954
<b>I figured what I saw could be...</b>

38
00:06:19,954 --> 00:06:22,138
<b>a glimpse of my previous life that I just can't remember.</b>

39
00:06:24,324 --> 00:06:28,008
<b>Ku Chan Seong will eventually bring him to you.</b>

40
00:06:34,204 --> 00:06:35,279
<b>This is absurd.</b>

41
00:06:35,944 --> 00:06:37,849
<b>Chan Seong can't be him.</b>

42
00:06:54,923 --> 00:06:58,738
<b>Man Weol will end up getting severely swayed...</b>

43
00:06:59,563 --> 00:07:00,669
<b>just because...</b>

44
00:07:02,003 --> 00:07:04,178
<b>of this small, green light.</b>

45
00:07:08,844 --> 00:07:09,948
<b>You've...</b>

46
00:07:10,743 --> 00:07:13,344
<b>become very weak because you had to come back...</b>

47
00:07:13,344 --> 00:07:14,589
<b>from the afterlife.</b>

48
00:07:15,983 --> 00:07:17,789
<b>And now, you're so dim.</b>

49
00:07:43,344 --> 00:07:44,818
<b>This alcohol is from this world.</b>

50
00:07:45,074 --> 00:07:46,944
<b>You almost crossed the threshold of the afterlife,</b>

51
00:07:46,944 --> 00:07:48,589
<b>so hurry up and drink something from this world.</b>

52
00:07:51,144 --> 00:07:52,258
<b>Thank you.</b>

53
00:07:57,524 --> 00:08:00,128
<b>I'm so relieved that you didn't get lost and found your way out.</b>

54
00:08:00,454 --> 00:08:01,493
<b>Yes, I heard...</b>

55
00:08:01,493 --> 00:08:04,123
<b>that time runs at a different speed there...</b>

56
00:08:04,123 --> 00:08:05,438
<b>and that I could lose my memory.</b>

57
00:08:05,493 --> 00:08:07,634
<b>Some people think they were gone only for a very short while,</b>

58
00:08:07,634 --> 00:08:09,163
<b>actually, 30 years had passed.</b>

59
00:08:09,163 --> 00:08:11,163
<b>Such a folktale wasn't a joke.</b>

60
00:08:11,163 --> 00:08:12,873
<b>I heard this from the Grim Reaper.</b>

61
00:08:12,873 --> 00:08:16,118
<b>Someone remembered his past life on his way back from the afterlife,</b>

62
00:08:16,144 --> 00:08:18,349
<b>which completely ruined his life in the living realm.</b>

63
00:08:18,413 --> 00:08:20,274
<b>- He remembered his past life? - Did you see...</b>

64
00:08:20,274 --> 00:08:21,859
<b>anything odd when you were there?</b>

65
00:08:30,324 --> 00:08:33,499
<b>I think I remember seeing something twinkling in the dark.</b>

66
00:08:33,824 --> 00:08:36,098
<b>- I see. - What was that?</b>

67
00:08:38,794 --> 00:08:40,808
<b>We don't know as we've never gone in there.</b>

68
00:08:42,003 --> 00:08:44,639
<b>You got to see it before us even though we're the dead ones.</b>

69
00:08:44,804 --> 00:08:47,434
<b>By the way, how did you manage to return right away?</b>

70
00:08:47,434 --> 00:08:48,743
<b>I heard it's not easy.</b>

71
00:08:48,743 --> 00:08:50,318
<b>Frankly, I have no recollection whatsoever.</b>

72
00:08:50,974 --> 00:08:53,013
<b>I was already out of there when I woke up.</b>

73
00:08:53,013 --> 00:08:55,889
<b>You lost your memory. Here, drink some more.</b>

74
00:08:58,513 --> 00:08:59,588
<b>Ms. Jang.</b>

75
00:09:07,653 --> 00:09:09,799
<b>I thought the kid got on the car to the afterlife.</b>

76
00:09:10,324 --> 00:09:12,169
<b>I ended up going in there while trying to stop that.</b>

77
00:09:12,363 --> 00:09:15,678
<b>Both the kid and I are fine, so don't be mad.</b>

78
00:09:58,844 --> 00:10:00,249
<b>I'm really fine.</b>

79
00:10:09,054 --> 00:10:10,928
<b>You are just Ku Chan Seong.</b>

80
00:10:17,794 --> 00:10:18,909
<b>Do you still...</b>

81
00:10:20,633 --> 00:10:21,909
<b>see me in your dreams?</b>

82
00:10:25,733 --> 00:10:28,749
<b>No, I haven't seen you in my dreams...</b>

83
00:10:30,474 --> 00:10:32,088
<b>since the day I had a very long dream.</b>

84
00:10:35,414 --> 00:10:36,958
<b>Then did you see someone else?</b>

85
00:10:37,184 --> 00:10:38,489
<b>I haven't told you...</b>

86
00:10:38,684 --> 00:10:41,289
<b>because I wasn't sure whether it was a dream or just my imagination,</b>

87
00:10:42,023 --> 00:10:43,299
<b>but I saw that man.</b>

88
00:10:44,824 --> 00:10:46,129
<b>The man named Chung Myung.</b>

89
00:10:49,964 --> 00:10:51,198
<b>He was waiting for you...</b>

90
00:10:51,834 --> 00:10:54,039
<b>by the lake all by himself.</b>

91
00:10:55,704 --> 00:10:59,049
<b>He was holding a moon-shaped ornament,</b>

92
00:10:59,304 --> 00:11:01,009
<b>which seemed like yours.</b>

93
00:11:06,013 --> 00:11:07,149
<b>Have you...</b>

94
00:11:08,314 --> 00:11:09,989
<b>received such a gift?</b>

95
00:11:13,084 --> 00:11:14,228
<b>No.</b>

96
00:11:17,383 --> 00:11:19,428
<b>If I'm not peeking into your memories,</b>

97
00:11:19,523 --> 00:11:20,769
<b>what was that dream about?</b>

98
00:11:26,263 --> 00:11:29,539
<b>At first, you told me that perhaps you're seeing...</b>

99
00:11:30,704 --> 00:11:33,608
<b>memories from your past life that you don't remember.</b>

100
00:11:33,733 --> 00:11:35,718
<b>Right, but you said that's impossible.</b>

101
00:11:40,873 --> 00:11:41,958
<b>Yes.</b>

102
00:11:43,444 --> 00:11:44,688
<b>It's impossible.</b>

103
00:11:47,513 --> 00:11:48,999
<b>Are you anxious...</b>

104
00:11:49,123 --> 00:11:51,828
<b>because of how Song Hwa and Yeon Woo ended up together?</b>

105
00:11:51,893 --> 00:11:53,499
<b>Are you worried he might return like that?</b>

106
00:11:54,493 --> 00:11:56,068
<b>I won't end up like them.</b>

107
00:11:58,164 --> 00:11:59,308
<b>They were...</b>

108
00:12:00,533 --> 00:12:02,938
<b>Fine. That happened in their past lives,</b>

109
00:12:03,263 --> 00:12:04,639
<b>so let's say it's possible.</b>

110
00:12:05,133 --> 00:12:07,279
<b>But with me, it happened in this lifetime.</b>

111
00:12:19,214 --> 00:12:21,588
<b>Seeing Yeon Woo with that woman...</b>

112
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:24,799
<b>made me think some crazy thoughts for a moment.</b>

113
00:12:47,814 --> 00:12:49,858
<b>- Dad. - Yun! Yes, Yun.</b>

114
00:12:51,013 --> 00:12:53,414
<b>He fell asleep at a bus stop.</b>

115
00:12:53,414 --> 00:12:55,858
<b>We brought him to the hospital because he had a fever.</b>

116
00:12:56,023 --> 00:12:58,828
<b>He took a fever reducer, so the fever has gone down.</b>

117
00:12:59,493 --> 00:13:00,899
<b>Thank you so much.</b>

118
00:13:03,493 --> 00:13:05,098
<b>Where have you been?</b>

119
00:13:05,263 --> 00:13:07,308
<b>I took the bus and went to the hotel.</b>

120
00:13:08,503 --> 00:13:10,379
<b>He must've had a dream when he was asleep.</b>

121
00:13:11,403 --> 00:13:14,678
<b>I went there to see Mom, but I was told that she's not there.</b>

122
00:13:18,873 --> 00:13:20,749
<b>When you're a little older,</b>

123
00:13:21,513 --> 00:13:24,914
<b>I'll tell you where your mom is and why she had to leave.</b>

124
00:13:24,914 --> 00:13:26,588
<b>I'll tell you everything, okay?</b>

125
00:13:27,253 --> 00:13:28,328
<b>Okay.</b>

126
00:13:29,253 --> 00:13:30,358
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

127
00:13:34,424 --> 00:13:37,539
<b>Would finding out later be less sad?</b>

128
00:13:38,363 --> 00:13:40,139
<b>He'll learn that he can never see her again.</b>

129
00:13:45,903 --> 00:13:49,478
<b>Does Yu Na know that you're planning to leave...</b>

130
00:13:49,804 --> 00:13:51,019
<b>with your younger sister after she dies?</b>

131
00:13:57,113 --> 00:13:58,259
<b>Yu Na.</b>

132
00:13:59,613 --> 00:14:01,954
<b>- You see... - Hey, Ms. Jang will yell at you...</b>

133
00:14:01,954 --> 00:14:04,483
<b>if you go back now, so let's hang out.</b>

134
00:14:04,483 --> 00:14:06,023
<b>- Well... - I learned...</b>

135
00:14:06,023 --> 00:14:08,669
<b>that you get scolded less if you wait it out a little.</b>

136
00:14:08,924 --> 00:14:10,999
<b>Wait here. I need to use the ladies' room.</b>

137
00:14:18,773 --> 00:14:20,208
<b>I should tell her today.</b>

138
00:14:29,883 --> 00:14:32,328
<b>Ma'am, listen to this for a moment.</b>

139
00:14:41,424 --> 00:14:43,568
<b>Do you like this piano melody?</b>

140
00:14:44,123 --> 00:14:45,198
<b>Well...</b>

141
00:14:45,633 --> 00:14:46,838
<b>Yes.</b>

142
00:14:47,893 --> 00:14:49,409
<b>My friend's sister...</b>

143
00:14:50,304 --> 00:14:53,348
<b>I mean, you look a lot like my friend's grandmother.</b>

144
00:14:53,403 --> 00:14:57,419
<b>May I take a photo of you listening to music to show my friend?</b>

145
00:14:58,444 --> 00:14:59,519
<b>Sure.</b>

146
00:15:02,243 --> 00:15:03,759
<b>Thank you.</b>

147
00:15:16,194 --> 00:15:19,233
<b>Well... Do you remember...</b>

148
00:15:19,233 --> 00:15:21,739
<b>your brother's name by any chance?</b>

149
00:15:22,334 --> 00:15:23,478
<b>Yes, I do.</b>

150
00:15:24,664 --> 00:15:27,149
<b>My brother's name is...</b>

151
00:15:28,033 --> 00:15:30,649
<b>Ji Hyun Joong.</b>

152
00:15:30,743 --> 00:15:32,749
<b>You remember him?</b>

153
00:15:33,773 --> 00:15:34,889
<b>Yes.</b>

154
00:15:40,954 --> 00:15:43,098
<b>Hello, can I help you?</b>

155
00:15:43,853 --> 00:15:45,098
<b>Hyun Joong.</b>

156
00:15:45,794 --> 00:15:47,299
<b>Yes, Hyun Mi.</b>

157
00:15:48,023 --> 00:15:49,799
<b>Were you listening to music?</b>

158
00:15:51,224 --> 00:15:52,739
<b>Let's see.</b>

159
00:15:52,863 --> 00:15:56,338
<b>Sir, are you the founder of this hospital,</b>

160
00:15:56,533 --> 00:15:59,204
<b>Mr. Ji Hyun Joong?</b>

161
00:15:59,204 --> 00:16:03,678
<b>Yes. You must be Mr. Kim's daughter who was hospitalized here.</b>

162
00:16:04,503 --> 00:16:05,844
<b>Hold on.</b>

163
00:16:05,844 --> 00:16:07,218
<b>You're...</b>

164
00:16:08,344 --> 00:16:09,958
<b>her brother?</b>

165
00:16:10,584 --> 00:16:12,728
<b>Yes, I am. What's the matter?</b>

166
00:16:12,783 --> 00:16:15,159
<b>But her brother, Ji Hyun Joong,</b>

167
00:16:15,454 --> 00:16:17,098
<b>died many years ago.</b>

168
00:16:18,283 --> 00:16:19,399
<b>What?</b>

169
00:16:22,993 --> 00:16:25,568
<b>Hyun Joong? Hyun Joong.</b>

170
00:16:26,033 --> 00:16:28,239
<b>- Where are you? - Yes, I'm here.</b>

171
00:16:29,533 --> 00:16:30,608
<b>Gosh.</b>

172
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:44,389
<b>There is someone who knows...</b>

173
00:16:45,983 --> 00:16:47,759
<b>that Ji Hyun Joong is dead.</b>

174
00:16:56,924 --> 00:16:58,523
<b>I told you not to bother Hyun Mi.</b>

175
00:16:58,523 --> 00:17:00,639
<b>Does that man have something to do with your death?</b>

176
00:17:01,164 --> 00:17:03,108
<b>Did he steal everything you had?</b>

177
00:17:03,334 --> 00:17:04,863
<b>And he's living as you now?</b>

178
00:17:04,863 --> 00:17:07,709
<b>- It's none of your business. - That's why you couldn't ascend.</b>

179
00:17:08,743 --> 00:17:11,449
<b>You couldn't stand him living a good life using your name.</b>

180
00:17:13,414 --> 00:17:15,884
<b>- Just leave him be. - How could I?</b>

181
00:17:15,884 --> 00:17:17,283
<b>He stole your life.</b>

182
00:17:17,283 --> 00:17:19,154
<b>Who cares? I'm already dead.</b>

183
00:17:19,154 --> 00:17:20,959
<b>Look at yourself living a good life.</b>

184
00:17:27,894 --> 00:17:29,098
<b>Right.</b>

185
00:17:29,624 --> 00:17:32,138
<b>I stole someone's life too.</b>

186
00:17:33,164 --> 00:17:34,568
<b>I was being too nosy.</b>

187
00:17:34,664 --> 00:17:35,904
<b>Yu Na, that's not what I meant.</b>

188
00:17:35,904 --> 00:17:37,239
<b>I'll mind my own business.</b>

189
00:17:50,614 --> 00:17:52,628
<b>Hey, Sanchez. Everything's going well, right?</b>

190
00:17:52,753 --> 00:17:55,128
<b>- Eat up! - What's up with all the noise?</b>

191
00:17:55,884 --> 00:17:57,029
<b>Is someone else home?</b>

192
00:17:57,283 --> 00:17:59,624
<b>Mi Ra had Detective Park sleep in your room last night...</b>

193
00:17:59,624 --> 00:18:01,628
<b>because his leg was swollen.</b>

194
00:18:01,654 --> 00:18:03,624
<b>I think he's fine now, but Mi Ra kept saying...</b>

195
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:06,533
<b>he must eat well as he's injured. We're eating now.</b>

196
00:18:06,533 --> 00:18:08,033
<b>When we were having a meal,</b>

197
00:18:08,033 --> 00:18:11,364
<b>Detective Park's colleagues came over since it's their day off.</b>

198
00:18:11,364 --> 00:18:13,303
<b>And when they came over, they said I had a nice yard,</b>

199
00:18:13,303 --> 00:18:15,148
<b>so they're having the watermelon they brought in the yard.</b>

200
00:18:16,503 --> 00:18:18,279
<b>Gosh, you guys look great together.</b>

201
00:18:19,914 --> 00:18:21,749
<b>Mi Ra brought people to the house.</b>

202
00:18:21,874 --> 00:18:24,618
<b>Chan Seong, it's very safe here.</b>

203
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:26,513
<b>Thanks to the incense Man Weol gave me,</b>

204
00:18:26,513 --> 00:18:28,253
<b>spiritually, it's safe here.</b>

205
00:18:28,253 --> 00:18:30,253
<b>When Mi Ra invited the detectives over to my house,</b>

206
00:18:30,253 --> 00:18:32,598
<b>I don't need to worry about being in danger.</b>

207
00:18:33,454 --> 00:18:35,868
<b>Sanchez, put Mi Ra on the phone. I'll talk to her.</b>

208
00:18:36,124 --> 00:18:37,299
<b>Don't.</b>

209
00:18:38,224 --> 00:18:40,194
<b>I'm sure she's bringing people over...</b>

210
00:18:40,194 --> 00:18:41,608
<b>in case I get depressed if I'm all alone.</b>

211
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:44,078
<b>It's nice and noisy here.</b>

212
00:18:44,434 --> 00:18:46,104
<b>Chan Seong, all I could think about...</b>

213
00:18:46,104 --> 00:18:48,848
<b>is making sure that they don't ruin the grass.</b>

214
00:18:49,874 --> 00:18:52,549
<b>Chan Seong, you don't need to worry about me.</b>

215
00:18:53,343 --> 00:18:55,783
<b>- This is good. - It is, right? I bought it.</b>

216
00:18:55,783 --> 00:18:57,418
<b>- No, you didn't. - I didn't?</b>

217
00:18:57,644 --> 00:18:58,929
<b>I'll eat it myself.</b>

218
00:18:59,553 --> 00:19:01,154
<b>Come on, you're injured.</b>

219
00:19:01,154 --> 00:19:02,429
<b>My arm is fine.</b>

220
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:06,469
<b>Should I break your arm, so you will let me feed you?</b>

221
00:19:07,854 --> 00:19:08,939
<b>Here.</b>

222
00:19:11,263 --> 00:19:12,838
<b>It's good, right?</b>

223
00:19:15,763 --> 00:19:17,908
<b>- You can eat it yourself now. - It's good.</b>

224
00:19:18,763 --> 00:19:19,773
<b>Isn't it sweet?</b>

225
00:19:19,773 --> 00:19:23,779
<b>I thought Mi Ra and Detective Park were always fighting like enemies.</b>

226
00:19:23,843 --> 00:19:25,888
<b>Now that I see them together, they seem fine.</b>

227
00:19:26,573 --> 00:19:28,019
<b>You don't need to worry.</b>

228
00:19:28,043 --> 00:19:29,618
<b>I think she'll move out soon.</b>

229
00:19:30,243 --> 00:19:33,358
<b>Chan Seong, I'm going to go eat some watermelon. Bye.</b>

230
00:19:35,114 --> 00:19:36,199
<b>Sanchez.</b>

231
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:38,628
<b>Eat the melon the detectives bought.</b>

232
00:19:39,194 --> 00:19:40,993
<b>- Come and join us. - It's delicious.</b>

233
00:19:40,993 --> 00:19:42,068
<b>Mi Ra.</b>

234
00:19:42,694 --> 00:19:45,138
<b>That melon came from my fridge.</b>

235
00:19:46,593 --> 00:19:47,808
<b>Is that so?</b>

236
00:19:49,134 --> 00:19:51,404
<b>- Let's eat it. - Things happen, you know.</b>

237
00:19:51,404 --> 00:19:53,134
<b>- The melon did feel cool. - Bring the cutting board.</b>

238
00:19:53,134 --> 00:19:54,578
<b>What does it matter?</b>

239
00:19:59,843 --> 00:20:00,918
<b>Come in.</b>

240
00:20:10,124 --> 00:20:11,358
<b>Do you remember...</b>

241
00:20:11,624 --> 00:20:14,368
<b>that Ms. Jang invited a woman to our hotel a while ago?</b>

242
00:20:14,924 --> 00:20:16,539
<b>This is an amazing hotel.</b>

243
00:20:17,164 --> 00:20:19,808
<b>And from what I've heard, she's your friend.</b>

244
00:20:20,263 --> 00:20:21,439
<b>That's right.</b>

245
00:20:21,993 --> 00:20:25,009
<b>Did she cross paths with Ms. Jang in her previous life?</b>

246
00:20:28,533 --> 00:20:29,878
<b>I'm sure their connection was ill-fated.</b>

247
00:20:31,073 --> 00:20:32,449
<b>We have never...</b>

248
00:20:33,043 --> 00:20:36,558
<b>tried to figure out Ms. Jang's story...</b>

249
00:20:37,144 --> 00:20:39,753
<b>because we always assumed that she had no intention...</b>

250
00:20:39,753 --> 00:20:42,628
<b>of leaving after settling her resentment.</b>

251
00:20:43,823 --> 00:20:47,429
<b>But the tree that tied her down here has changed.</b>

252
00:20:47,523 --> 00:20:50,364
<b>And I think the changes have been brought...</b>

253
00:20:50,364 --> 00:20:53,638
<b>by you and the connections you have brought.</b>

254
00:20:54,233 --> 00:20:55,539
<b>Your assumption...</b>

255
00:20:57,503 --> 00:20:58,608
<b>is correct.</b>

256
00:21:00,204 --> 00:21:01,709
<b>In addition to that lady,</b>

257
00:21:02,374 --> 00:21:04,679
<b>will Ms. Jang face more connections from her past?</b>

258
00:21:06,444 --> 00:21:07,689
<b>He's already here.</b>

259
00:21:08,343 --> 00:21:09,489
<b>And I'm sure...</b>

260
00:21:10,283 --> 00:21:11,418
<b>more will come shortly.</b>

261
00:21:14,513 --> 00:21:18,029
<b>I'll probably end up bringing the man to Ms. Jang like the others.</b>

262
00:21:19,093 --> 00:21:22,598
<b>That must be why Ma Go brought you to our hotel.</b>

263
00:21:22,964 --> 00:21:24,823
<b>Then, I take it that you must have crossed paths...</b>

264
00:21:24,823 --> 00:21:26,769
<b>with Ms. Jang in your previous life as well.</b>

265
00:21:27,493 --> 00:21:28,608
<b>No, I have not.</b>

266
00:21:29,033 --> 00:21:30,138
<b>Is that so?</b>

267
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:31,979
<b>That's odd.</b>

268
00:21:32,303 --> 00:21:34,674
<b>If you have never met her in your previous life,</b>

269
00:21:34,674 --> 00:21:37,449
<b>why did Ma Go choose you out of everyone?</b>

270
00:21:43,944 --> 00:21:46,229
<b>I'm sure the deity must have a reason for bringing you to her.</b>

271
00:21:46,783 --> 00:21:49,499
<b>Anyway, it resulted in love.</b>

272
00:21:51,454 --> 00:21:52,668
<b>I will continue...</b>

273
00:21:54,224 --> 00:21:55,529
<b>to stay with her.</b>

274
00:21:59,864 --> 00:22:01,709
<b>My heart breaks for Ms. Jang.</b>

275
00:22:02,604 --> 00:22:03,709
<b>Soon,</b>

276
00:22:04,763 --> 00:22:07,049
<b>she will have to face someone...</b>

277
00:22:08,604 --> 00:22:10,378
<b>who will inflict the most pain.</b>

278
00:22:28,493 --> 00:22:29,939
<b>Jang Man Weol.</b>

279
00:22:31,194 --> 00:22:32,739
<b>Why are you leaving?</b>

280
00:22:32,864 --> 00:22:34,108
<b>I don't want to see you.</b>

281
00:22:35,864 --> 00:22:38,638
<b>Admire the flowers you have wanted as much as you want...</b>

282
00:22:39,374 --> 00:22:40,374
<b>and just leave.</b>

283
00:22:40,374 --> 00:22:41,449
<b>Then...</b>

284
00:22:41,974 --> 00:22:44,418
<b>will you let him just pass by?</b>

285
00:22:45,144 --> 00:22:46,489
<b>Will you pretend to be clueless?</b>

286
00:22:51,114 --> 00:22:53,088
<b>You have met him.</b>

287
00:23:01,194 --> 00:23:02,838
<b>You can't run away from it.</b>

288
00:23:03,763 --> 00:23:05,168
<b>He's already...</b>

289
00:23:05,993 --> 00:23:07,539
<b>by your side.</b>

290
00:23:14,803 --> 00:23:17,148
<b>I finally get to give this to you.</b>

291
00:23:20,243 --> 00:23:21,418
<b>It's yours.</b>

292
00:23:39,434 --> 00:23:40,769
<b>But I saw that man.</b>

293
00:23:41,293 --> 00:23:42,608
<b>The man named Chung Myung.</b>

294
00:23:44,533 --> 00:23:47,848
<b>He was holding a moon-shaped ornament,</b>

295
00:23:48,704 --> 00:23:50,418
<b>which seemed like yours.</b>

296
00:23:54,843 --> 00:23:56,219
<b>Is it Chan Seong?</b>

297
00:23:57,644 --> 00:23:58,959
<b>If it is him,</b>

298
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:01,989
<b>will you be able to accept it?</b>

299
00:24:05,793 --> 00:24:07,168
<b>Is Chan Seong...</b>

300
00:24:08,093 --> 00:24:09,699
<b>that man?</b>

301
00:24:12,694 --> 00:24:14,134
<b>The man you have been waiting for over 1,000 years...</b>

302
00:24:14,134 --> 00:24:15,593
<b>has finally shown up,</b>

303
00:24:15,593 --> 00:24:17,039
<b>but you don't seem happy.</b>

304
00:24:20,073 --> 00:24:23,249
<b>You were so sure of yourself that once he came to this world,</b>

305
00:24:24,273 --> 00:24:26,648
<b>you'd kill him and cease to exist.</b>

306
00:24:28,273 --> 00:24:30,289
<b>Are you second-guessing yourself now?</b>

307
00:24:35,053 --> 00:24:36,299
<b>So I asked...</b>

308
00:24:38,454 --> 00:24:39,799
<b>if that man is Chan Seong.</b>

309
00:24:40,523 --> 00:24:44,199
<b>You have fed the hatred of yours for a long time.</b>

310
00:24:45,023 --> 00:24:48,509
<b>Why don't you let go of your hatred with your love which took ages...</b>

311
00:24:49,563 --> 00:24:50,908
<b>to reach you?</b>

312
00:24:57,243 --> 00:24:59,989
<b>I have hated the man for over 1,000 years.</b>

313
00:25:02,214 --> 00:25:05,459
<b>But you made me see him as a man whom I fell in love with?</b>

314
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:09,999
<b>I'm curious to find out which man...</b>

315
00:25:11,023 --> 00:25:12,499
<b>you'll see him as.</b>

316
00:25:13,854 --> 00:25:17,368
<b>Will you see him as Ko Chung Myung and cease to exist?</b>

317
00:25:18,224 --> 00:25:21,209
<b>Or will you see him as Ku Chan Seong and be saved?</b>

318
00:25:22,394 --> 00:25:23,539
<b>It is...</b>

319
00:25:24,934 --> 00:25:26,549
<b>up to you.</b>

320
00:26:23,563 --> 00:26:24,699
<b>Ms. Jang.</b>

321
00:26:30,763 --> 00:26:33,573
<b>Every sight you see with me will look different.</b>

322
00:26:33,573 --> 00:26:36,378
<b>The view here looks prettier now that we're seeing it together.</b>

323
00:26:39,174 --> 00:26:40,689
<b>I'm proud of you,</b>

324
00:26:41,144 --> 00:26:42,219
<b>Man Weol.</b>

325
00:27:37,604 --> 00:27:38,779
<b>I told you...</b>

326
00:27:40,204 --> 00:27:41,679
<b>to trust me.</b>

327
00:28:07,063 --> 00:28:08,168
<b>Chan Seong.</b>

328
00:28:51,704 --> 00:28:52,779
<b>Ms. Jang.</b>

329
00:28:57,283 --> 00:28:59,318
<b>Are you all right?</b>

330
00:29:00,513 --> 00:29:02,189
<b>You look very pale.</b>

331
00:29:14,233 --> 00:29:15,509
<b>A moment ago,</b>

332
00:29:17,204 --> 00:29:20,049
<b>I killed Chan Seong in my thoughts.</b>

333
00:29:24,803 --> 00:29:26,019
<b>He could be...</b>

334
00:29:28,243 --> 00:29:31,289
<b>the reincarnation of the man I abhor the most.</b>

335
00:29:32,144 --> 00:29:33,229
<b>I'm sure it isn't him.</b>

336
00:29:34,454 --> 00:29:36,799
<b>Mr. Ku also said it wasn't him.</b>

337
00:29:38,053 --> 00:29:39,158
<b>Right.</b>

338
00:29:39,894 --> 00:29:41,229
<b>It might not be him.</b>

339
00:29:41,993 --> 00:29:43,523
<b>But as long as there is slightest possibility...</b>

340
00:29:43,523 --> 00:29:45,138
<b>that it could be him,</b>

341
00:29:45,593 --> 00:29:47,469
<b>I will never be able...</b>

342
00:29:48,833 --> 00:29:50,608
<b>to face Chan Seong.</b>

343
00:29:52,033 --> 00:29:53,179
<b>Now...</b>

344
00:29:53,934 --> 00:29:55,209
<b>what will you do?</b>

345
00:30:09,184 --> 00:30:11,699
<b>I can never kill Chan Seong.</b>

346
00:30:16,464 --> 00:30:18,999
<b>Ma Go says I have to empty out everything.</b>

347
00:30:22,533 --> 00:30:24,279
<b>Now I have to think hard...</b>

348
00:30:27,204 --> 00:30:28,808
<b>about how to do that.</b>

349
00:31:00,204 --> 00:31:02,078
<b>I bought them from that shop you like.</b>

350
00:31:02,404 --> 00:31:04,878
<b>You will feel better after you eat something sweet.</b>

351
00:31:06,843 --> 00:31:07,949
<b>Come and sit down.</b>

352
00:31:14,354 --> 00:31:15,759
<b>What do you have in your hand?</b>

353
00:31:24,593 --> 00:31:27,638
<b>It's the ornament I saw in my dreams.</b>

354
00:31:31,333 --> 00:31:33,279
<b>This came from your dream.</b>

355
00:31:34,904 --> 00:31:36,209
<b>Ma Go gave it to me.</b>

356
00:31:36,503 --> 00:31:39,318
<b>In my dreams, it didn't have any blood on it.</b>

357
00:31:39,573 --> 00:31:41,489
<b>I told you he died at my sword.</b>

358
00:31:42,944 --> 00:31:44,088
<b>This blood...</b>

359
00:31:44,783 --> 00:31:47,229
<b>must be filled with the hatred for me.</b>

360
00:31:47,454 --> 00:31:49,429
<b>Why did Ma Go give you such an ominous thing?</b>

361
00:31:50,354 --> 00:31:51,999
<b>Give it to me. I'll keep it for you.</b>

362
00:31:57,224 --> 00:31:58,739
<b>I will get rid of this myself.</b>

363
00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:01,269
<b>The moon covered in blood...</b>

364
00:32:02,233 --> 00:32:03,378
<b>must be destroyed.</b>

365
00:32:04,434 --> 00:32:06,138
<b>Ma Go always tells me that.</b>

366
00:32:06,733 --> 00:32:08,408
<b>To empty the moon...</b>

367
00:32:09,573 --> 00:32:10,719
<b>that is filled with hatred.</b>

368
00:32:11,743 --> 00:32:12,918
<b>Can you do that?</b>

369
00:32:15,714 --> 00:32:16,818
<b>I have to.</b>

370
00:32:19,753 --> 00:32:21,128
<b>I want to call in...</b>

371
00:32:23,224 --> 00:32:24,358
<b>the moon covered in blood.</b>

372
00:32:30,263 --> 00:32:31,368
<b>Mr. Ku.</b>

373
00:32:32,093 --> 00:32:33,168
<b>Mr. Ku.</b>

374
00:32:33,694 --> 00:32:34,769
<b>You are here.</b>

375
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:39,749
<b>The Grim Reaper is looking for you.</b>

376
00:32:42,073 --> 00:32:43,179
<b>Go on.</b>

377
00:32:54,983 --> 00:32:57,158
<b>I have found the vengeful spirit that cursed you.</b>

378
00:32:57,724 --> 00:32:58,999
<b>You've found Seol Ji Won.</b>

379
00:32:59,424 --> 00:33:02,199
<b>Has he become more powerful as he wanted?</b>

380
00:33:02,793 --> 00:33:05,398
<b>Do you think a vengeful spirit that holds unjustifiable resentment...</b>

381
00:33:05,724 --> 00:33:07,868
<b>can become powerful as he wishes?</b>

382
00:33:08,563 --> 00:33:12,408
<b>He is only hiding in the dark like a gutter rat.</b>

383
00:33:12,563 --> 00:33:13,709
<b>That's good to know.</b>

384
00:33:13,803 --> 00:33:16,779
<b>His yearning to become eviler hasn't become stronger.</b>

385
00:33:17,404 --> 00:33:20,289
<b>He's just hiding in the dark like a coward.</b>

386
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:24,358
<b>Can you help me?</b>

387
00:33:25,843 --> 00:33:27,759
<b>I heard you were good at acting as bait.</b>

388
00:33:28,614 --> 00:33:30,799
<b>I won't reveal who recommended you.</b>

389
00:33:31,083 --> 00:33:32,429
<b>I'm sure it's Mr. Kim.</b>

390
00:33:35,424 --> 00:33:38,969
<b>I'll take it that a work colleague thinks highly of my skills.</b>

391
00:33:39,624 --> 00:33:42,908
<b>Many human managers worked here.</b>

392
00:33:43,803 --> 00:33:44,979
<b>Among them, you are...</b>

393
00:33:48,874 --> 00:33:50,148
<b>That is my assessment.</b>

394
00:33:53,343 --> 00:33:54,418
<b>Thank you.</b>

395
00:33:57,144 --> 00:34:00,729
<b>Did you start working at Guest House of the Moon from the start?</b>

396
00:34:01,714 --> 00:34:02,789
<b>Yes.</b>

397
00:34:03,523 --> 00:34:05,424
<b>I guided a number of spirits...</b>

398
00:34:05,424 --> 00:34:07,729
<b>from this place to the other world.</b>

399
00:34:09,423 --> 00:34:11,869
<b>Take care of your guests.</b>

400
00:34:12,064 --> 00:34:13,139
<b>Especially...</b>

401
00:34:13,834 --> 00:34:14,969
<b>your first guest.</b>

402
00:34:17,533 --> 00:34:19,509
<b>Who was the first guest of this place?</b>

403
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:24,478
<b>Ma Go said that the first guest was the most important.</b>

404
00:34:25,443 --> 00:34:26,889
<b>I have not guided...</b>

405
00:34:29,213 --> 00:34:30,818
<b>the first guest of this place.</b>

406
00:34:33,084 --> 00:34:34,288
<b>Nobody in this place...</b>

407
00:34:35,354 --> 00:34:38,329
<b>has seen the faint light of his existence.</b>

408
00:34:39,283 --> 00:34:40,998
<b>How could that happen to a guest?</b>

409
00:34:41,394 --> 00:34:43,369
<b>I do not give answers.</b>

410
00:34:44,263 --> 00:34:45,498
<b>I only guide them to the end.</b>

411
00:34:46,934 --> 00:34:48,038
<b>First,</b>

412
00:34:50,363 --> 00:34:51,779
<b>let's go catch that vengeful spirit.</b>

413
00:34:51,903 --> 00:34:56,818
<b>(The Sanzu River)</b>

414
00:35:24,403 --> 00:35:26,279
<b>Since it has the sign of the moon...</b>

415
00:35:27,434 --> 00:35:29,679
<b>he must have made it for you.</b>

416
00:35:32,504 --> 00:35:35,788
<b>And you would have been so happy when you received it.</b>

417
00:35:39,743 --> 00:35:42,159
<b>That disgusts me about you.</b>

418
00:35:58,334 --> 00:35:59,538
<b>When he came,</b>

419
00:36:01,604 --> 00:36:03,378
<b>I was going to throw him into the fiery pit that you made...</b>

420
00:36:04,274 --> 00:36:06,079
<b>and make both of you cease to exist.</b>

421
00:36:11,743 --> 00:36:13,188
<b>However, because of the scheming of the deities,</b>

422
00:36:14,013 --> 00:36:15,929
<b>I can't do that anymore.</b>

423
00:36:18,423 --> 00:36:19,559
<b>I...</b>

424
00:36:21,294 --> 00:36:23,739
<b>ended up falling in love again.</b>

425
00:36:28,993 --> 00:36:30,438
<b>Leaning on that love,</b>

426
00:36:34,204 --> 00:36:36,478
<b>I tried to ignore you.</b>

427
00:36:38,504 --> 00:36:39,748
<b>You just had to...</b>

428
00:36:40,743 --> 00:36:42,949
<b>drag me down again.</b>

429
00:36:53,053 --> 00:36:54,168
<b>I will...</b>

430
00:36:55,224 --> 00:36:56,529
<b>put you in here...</b>

431
00:36:58,093 --> 00:37:00,809
<b>and dump it in a trash bin around here.</b>

432
00:37:02,533 --> 00:37:04,108
<b>You will go berserk.</b>

433
00:37:07,974 --> 00:37:10,179
<b>And we will cease to exist together.</b>

434
00:38:02,193 --> 00:38:03,398
<b>Seol Ji Won.</b>

435
00:38:03,693 --> 00:38:04,768
<b>Come out.</b>

436
00:38:08,064 --> 00:38:09,639
<b>I know you're hiding in here.</b>

437
00:38:10,934 --> 00:38:13,079
<b>The Grim Reaper is on his way to take you.</b>

438
00:38:24,713 --> 00:38:25,858
<b>There you are.</b>

439
00:38:28,754 --> 00:38:32,329
<b>So you went from being a smug jerk to a loser.</b>

440
00:38:37,164 --> 00:38:38,838
<b>I have something for you.</b>

441
00:38:45,533 --> 00:38:46,978
<b>Eat this.</b>

442
00:38:49,334 --> 00:38:50,518
<b>Eat it...</b>

443
00:38:52,943 --> 00:38:54,088
<b>and become an evil spirit.</b>

444
00:39:17,234 --> 00:39:20,549
<b>So he came hiding to the place he's familiar with.</b>

445
00:39:20,774 --> 00:39:24,079
<b>He's in the darkness, but he will reveal himself once he sees you.</b>

446
00:39:39,653 --> 00:39:42,068
<b>Ms. Jang, you're here too.</b>

447
00:39:43,894 --> 00:39:45,068
<b>Yes, I came ahead.</b>

448
00:39:46,993 --> 00:39:48,108
<b>Did you catch him?</b>

449
00:39:50,664 --> 00:39:51,779
<b>I let him go.</b>

450
00:39:55,303 --> 00:39:57,179
<b>Danger will now find you...</b>

451
00:39:58,173 --> 00:39:59,349
<b>because I gave him...</b>

452
00:40:01,073 --> 00:40:03,318
<b>a special gift.</b>

453
00:40:06,243 --> 00:40:09,688
<b>You'll have your work cut out for you with this one.</b>

454
00:40:10,823 --> 00:40:14,268
<b>He might go crazy with his new-found powers.</b>

455
00:40:15,854 --> 00:40:17,199
<b>What are you doing?</b>

456
00:40:18,664 --> 00:40:19,768
<b>Chan Seong.</b>

457
00:40:22,593 --> 00:40:24,478
<b>Ma Go said that you're him.</b>

458
00:40:35,974 --> 00:40:37,889
<b>I need to kill you,</b>

459
00:40:39,013 --> 00:40:40,489
<b>but I won't be able to.</b>

460
00:40:43,553 --> 00:40:45,228
<b>I just like you too much.</b>

461
00:40:52,294 --> 00:40:54,239
<b>But I won't protect you though.</b>

462
00:40:55,693 --> 00:40:58,309
<b>I waited for over 1,000 years to kill you,</b>

463
00:40:58,863 --> 00:41:00,378
<b>so I'll be making...</b>

464
00:41:01,673 --> 00:41:03,409
<b>a mockery out of myself if I protect you.</b>

465
00:41:11,113 --> 00:41:13,059
<b>If the vengeful spirit becomes an evil one,</b>

466
00:41:13,213 --> 00:41:15,728
<b>he will become stronger, and you will cease to exist too.</b>

467
00:41:20,724 --> 00:41:21,799
<b>Whatever.</b>

468
00:41:26,863 --> 00:41:29,068
<b>You're a human adored by Ma Go,</b>

469
00:41:29,834 --> 00:41:31,878
<b>so they'll interfere before the spirit gets to you.</b>

470
00:41:33,204 --> 00:41:34,378
<b>And...</b>

471
00:41:36,073 --> 00:41:37,779
<b>you'll perish.</b>

472
00:41:44,484 --> 00:41:46,518
<b>So I only ended up using you.</b>

473
00:41:49,883 --> 00:41:52,099
<b>What I call love couldn't be more pathetic.</b>

474
00:42:12,073 --> 00:42:15,049
<b>Ms. Jang!</b>

475
00:42:30,993 --> 00:42:33,099
<b>- What's with the hotel? - Beats me.</b>

476
00:42:33,193 --> 00:42:36,038
<b>All the lights in the building have gone out.</b>

477
00:42:48,573 --> 00:42:51,719
<b>Mr. Ku, something happened to Ms. Jang?</b>

478
00:42:52,044 --> 00:42:53,358
<b>I think there was a misunderstanding.</b>

479
00:42:53,684 --> 00:42:55,389
<b>Do you know where she is?</b>

480
00:42:55,484 --> 00:42:57,754
<b>She went into the garden where the Moon Tree stands...</b>

481
00:42:57,754 --> 00:42:59,199
<b>and barricaded the door.</b>

482
00:43:00,323 --> 00:43:01,728
<b>No one can enter.</b>

483
00:43:29,783 --> 00:43:32,854
<b>We should check on our guests first.</b>

484
00:43:32,854 --> 00:43:34,869
<b>I don't understand why we're in trouble now.</b>

485
00:43:49,334 --> 00:43:50,418
<b>Ms. Jang,</b>

486
00:43:50,874 --> 00:43:53,179
<b>what on earth are you up to?</b>

487
00:43:57,914 --> 00:43:59,059
<b>Is it true?</b>

488
00:44:00,084 --> 00:44:02,088
<b>Am I truly that man...</b>

489
00:44:03,314 --> 00:44:04,759
<b>whom Ms. Jang loathes?</b>

490
00:44:05,923 --> 00:44:08,469
<b>I doubt those were her exact words...</b>

491
00:44:08,923 --> 00:44:09,998
<b>since he...</b>

492
00:44:11,124 --> 00:44:12,398
<b>is right here.</b>

493
00:44:32,213 --> 00:44:34,389
<b>You've met him before, you know.</b>

494
00:44:52,704 --> 00:44:53,978
<b>How...</b>

495
00:44:55,303 --> 00:44:56,509
<b>is this him?</b>

496
00:44:57,743 --> 00:44:58,949
<b>He is...</b>

497
00:45:00,544 --> 00:45:02,748
<b>the first guest who stayed at...</b>

498
00:45:03,274 --> 00:45:05,188
<b>Man Weol's Guest House of the Moon.</b>

499
00:45:14,823 --> 00:45:16,323
<b>I should take him to her.</b>

500
00:45:16,323 --> 00:45:17,398
<b>Actually,</b>

501
00:45:18,963 --> 00:45:21,838
<b>shouldn't you stop her from being perished first?</b>

502
00:45:23,033 --> 00:45:26,909
<b>Find the object Man Weol handed over to the evil spirit.</b>

503
00:45:27,704 --> 00:45:29,349
<b>Once the evil spirit makes his move,</b>

504
00:45:30,004 --> 00:45:32,179
<b>the ramification will be set in stone.</b>

505
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:41,528
<b>Working overtime earned us a few extra bucks,</b>

506
00:45:41,692 --> 00:45:43,023
<b>so let's grab a drink.</b>

507
00:45:43,023 --> 00:45:44,337
<b>- Sure. - Let's go.</b>

508
00:45:52,132 --> 00:45:54,647
<b>I hear he cursed his wife so that she'd die.</b>

509
00:45:54,833 --> 00:45:57,172
<b>What a piece of garbage.</b>

510
00:45:57,172 --> 00:45:58,977
<b>Does he have no shame?</b>

511
00:46:05,978 --> 00:46:10,978


512
00:46:16,393 --> 00:46:17,468
<b>Hello.</b>

513
00:46:54,833 --> 00:46:56,733
<b>Who on earth are you?</b>

514
00:46:56,733 --> 00:46:58,877
<b>You should hurry on out of here.</b>

515
00:47:04,003 --> 00:47:05,348
<b>Greetings, my friend.</b>

516
00:47:11,782 --> 00:47:13,882
<b>I was going to visit you after I had some fun.</b>

517
00:47:13,882 --> 00:47:15,127
<b>But I guess you were in a hurry.</b>

518
00:47:15,282 --> 00:47:16,558
<b>How did you find me?</b>

519
00:47:16,753 --> 00:47:18,098
<b>I found you thanks to the owner...</b>

520
00:47:18,922 --> 00:47:20,127
<b>of the item that you recently picked up.</b>

521
00:47:22,692 --> 00:47:23,797
<b>This?</b>

522
00:47:23,822 --> 00:47:26,167
<b>I came to take that back. Give it to me.</b>

523
00:47:26,762 --> 00:47:27,968
<b>How are you going to do that?</b>

524
00:47:29,592 --> 00:47:31,078
<b>You'll die before you can take it from me.</b>

525
00:47:43,313 --> 00:47:44,517
<b>So this is how...</b>

526
00:47:45,643 --> 00:47:47,288
<b>you've come to face me.</b>

527
00:48:19,882 --> 00:48:21,158
<b>I guess you're not going to give up.</b>

528
00:48:21,683 --> 00:48:22,988
<b>Let's see how long you'll last.</b>

529
00:48:24,583 --> 00:48:25,997
<b>I was just buying time.</b>

530
00:48:27,023 --> 00:48:28,127
<b>The time has come.</b>

531
00:48:29,422 --> 00:48:30,567
<b>The moon's showing itself.</b>

532
00:48:38,532 --> 00:48:40,308
<b>Why do you think she gave that to you?</b>

533
00:48:40,733 --> 00:48:42,448
<b>I told you that she will protect me.</b>

534
00:48:45,503 --> 00:48:46,817
<b>Do you see that sign of the moon?</b>

535
00:48:49,672 --> 00:48:50,888
<b>Once the moon fully reveals itself,</b>

536
00:48:51,183 --> 00:48:52,988
<b>you'll be doomed for having that with you.</b>

537
00:48:53,112 --> 00:48:54,428
<b>Stop trying to fool me.</b>

538
00:48:54,552 --> 00:48:56,258
<b>I told you that death isn't the end, didn't I?</b>

539
00:48:57,083 --> 00:48:59,828
<b>I tried to stop you, but you just chose to die.</b>

540
00:49:03,453 --> 00:49:06,098
<b>Now, it's time for you to fall into the fiery pit.</b>

541
00:49:07,362 --> 00:49:08,538
<b>Goodbye, Seol Ji Won.</b>

542
00:49:28,612 --> 00:49:29,788
<b>How dare you lie to me?</b>

543
00:49:30,453 --> 00:49:31,658
<b>Just die.</b>

544
00:49:39,163 --> 00:49:40,437
<b>I never lied to you.</b>

545
00:49:43,592 --> 00:49:44,908
<b>You're really doomed.</b>

546
00:50:21,402 --> 00:50:22,972
<b>I was also once...</b>

547
00:50:22,972 --> 00:50:24,877
<b>a vengeful ghost full of spite.</b>

548
00:50:25,003 --> 00:50:26,302
<b>If we add up the years that we've been dead,</b>

549
00:50:26,302 --> 00:50:27,647
<b>it becomes a total of 770 years.</b>

550
00:50:27,773 --> 00:50:30,388
<b>But you're nothing but a runt that just died.</b>

551
00:50:30,442 --> 00:50:32,218
<b>How dare you act up this way?</b>

552
00:50:37,152 --> 00:50:39,658
<b>Take what you found, and go back to the hotel.</b>

553
00:50:40,953 --> 00:50:42,067
<b>Okay.</b>

554
00:51:04,543 --> 00:51:05,758
<b>I caught him.</b>

555
00:51:06,083 --> 00:51:09,127
<b>We did all the work. You're just taking credit.</b>

556
00:51:20,222 --> 00:51:21,692
<b>You gave yourself to the vengeful ghost...</b>

557
00:51:21,692 --> 00:51:23,267
<b>and tried to turn him into an evil spirit.</b>

558
00:51:24,262 --> 00:51:26,377
<b>I cannot forgive you for that.</b>

559
00:51:27,773 --> 00:51:30,877
<b>I took out my most wicked thought that I had deep down inside...</b>

560
00:51:33,043 --> 00:51:34,848
<b>and gave it to the vengeful ghost.</b>

561
00:51:35,512 --> 00:51:37,587
<b>Then what does that make you?</b>

562
00:51:39,612 --> 00:51:41,428
<b>Are you just a heartbroken moon...</b>

563
00:51:41,913 --> 00:51:45,457
<b>that blooms and withers flowers...</b>

564
00:51:46,253 --> 00:51:48,167
<b>as time repeats itself?</b>

565
00:51:54,793 --> 00:51:56,038
<b>Just make me perish.</b>

566
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:14,857
<b>No!</b>

567
00:52:19,422 --> 00:52:20,598
<b>I brought it back.</b>

568
00:52:21,422 --> 00:52:22,897
<b>There's no reason that she must cease to exist.</b>

569
00:52:23,353 --> 00:52:24,497
<b>Please leave.</b>

570
00:52:25,523 --> 00:52:26,897
<b>Just make me perish!</b>

571
00:52:34,902 --> 00:52:35,977
<b>Fine.</b>

572
00:52:36,902 --> 00:52:38,078
<b>Go ahead and have what you want.</b>

573
00:52:41,373 --> 00:52:42,988
<b>If you must torment yourself like that,</b>

574
00:52:43,713 --> 00:52:46,118
<b>I'll become the guy that you keep thinking I am.</b>

575
00:52:51,152 --> 00:52:52,297
<b>Kill me.</b>

576
00:53:08,003 --> 00:53:10,408
<b>I promised I'd stay by your side even if I have to die...</b>

577
00:53:12,672 --> 00:53:14,448
<b>for getting in your way.</b>

578
00:54:11,063 --> 00:54:12,538
<b>The man you've been waiting for...</b>

579
00:54:15,802 --> 00:54:17,078
<b>is actually here.</b>

580
00:54:22,842 --> 00:54:24,087
<b>You came all the way here.</b>

581
00:54:24,442 --> 00:54:26,417
<b>So you should listen to what happened on the day...</b>

582
00:54:29,483 --> 00:54:30,587
<b>that the moon got covered in blood.</b>

583
00:54:32,882 --> 00:54:34,997
<b>That way, you'll be able to empty your resentment.</b>

584
00:54:46,032 --> 00:54:48,207
<b>Is this the afterlife?</b>

585
00:54:49,172 --> 00:54:53,147
<b>The afterlife that you'll encounter won't be so magnificent.</b>

586
00:54:54,302 --> 00:54:57,187
<b>But there are some people who wish to see you before you leave.</b>

587
00:54:58,112 --> 00:54:59,187
<b>Me?</b>

588
00:54:59,342 --> 00:55:01,587
<b>Our hotel guests are waiting for you.</b>

589
00:55:03,913 --> 00:55:06,727
<b>This is a special service for our guests.</b>

590
00:55:08,793 --> 00:55:10,468
<b>What a typical number.</b>

591
00:55:11,862 --> 00:55:13,797
<b>What is this? Is it the fiery pit?</b>

592
00:55:14,663 --> 00:55:16,267
<b>You'll find out once you go inside.</b>

593
00:55:56,003 --> 00:55:58,118
<b>Do you remember what you said to all of us...</b>

594
00:55:58,442 --> 00:56:00,278
<b>right before you killed us?</b>

595
00:56:02,713 --> 00:56:03,788
<b>Hello.</b>

<b>Mr. Ku Chan Seong works here?</b>

<b>Yes, my boss invited you.</b>

<b>I've already been there once as my friend works there.</b>

00:58:58,083 --> 00:59:00,258
<b>This time, I shall drink it slowly and really savor it.</b>

631
00:59:00,382 --> 00:59:01,497
<b>Give us our drinks.</b>

632
00:59:14,532 --> 00:59:16,402
<b>This is a petal.</b>

633
00:59:16,402 --> 00:59:18,977
<b>It's a petal from the Moon Tree.</b>

634
00:59:19,003 --> 00:59:20,218
<b>The Moon Tree?</b>

635
00:59:20,402 --> 00:59:22,972
<b>There is such a tree?</b>

636
00:59:22,972 --> 00:59:24,917
<b>I'm sure there is.</b>

637
00:59:26,242 --> 00:59:27,618
<b>This is so pretty.</b>

638
00:59:30,483 --> 00:59:33,828
<b>Those from that time of your life are here now.</b>

639
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:37,098
<b>You'll be able to find out...</b>

640
00:59:38,692 --> 00:59:40,638
<b>more about him through them.</b>

641
01:00:25,143 --> 01:00:26,218
<b>Chung Myung.</b>

642
01:00:39,253 --> 01:00:41,357
<b>My father is looking for you.</b>

643
01:00:42,152 --> 01:00:43,897
<b>Why is he looking for me?</b>

644
01:00:43,922 --> 01:00:46,422
<b>We received a tip that you are in league...</b>

645
01:00:46,422 --> 01:00:48,567
<b>with the rebels in Mount Dongmo.</b>

646
01:00:53,463 --> 01:00:55,778
<b>You will die if you go see my father now.</b>

647
01:00:55,972 --> 01:00:58,008
<b>So I sent some soldiers.</b>

648
01:00:59,472 --> 01:01:02,517
<b>I told them to go capture everyone helping the one you're waiting for.</b>

649
01:01:03,072 --> 01:01:05,012
<b>What do you mean?</b>

650
01:01:05,012 --> 01:01:07,317
<b>Those bandits are remnants of Goguryeo.</b>

651
01:01:07,382 --> 01:01:09,683
<b>If you capture all of them and take them to my father,</b>

652
01:01:09,683 --> 01:01:11,158
<b>he will no longer suspect you.</b>

653
01:01:12,483 --> 01:01:15,992
<b>They're just wandering thieves that steal from peddlers.</b>

654
01:01:15,992 --> 01:01:18,198
<b>If you are executed as a traitor,</b>

655
01:01:18,262 --> 01:01:20,163
<b>all your subordinates...</b>

656
01:01:20,163 --> 01:01:23,408
<b>as well as everyone who is related to you will die.</b>

657
01:01:24,632 --> 01:01:26,207
<b>Even if there are hundreds of people,</b>

658
01:01:26,833 --> 01:01:29,247
<b>my father will kill them all as he is afraid of a coup.</b>

659
01:01:32,643 --> 01:01:34,317
<b>Go and capture them all.</b>

660
01:02:39,402 --> 01:02:41,547
<b>Just catch the ones that stole.</b>

661
01:02:41,742 --> 01:02:43,647
<b>Why are you taking all the innocent villagers?</b>

662
01:02:43,742 --> 01:02:45,618
<b>I'm not here to catch thieves.</b>

663
01:02:46,112 --> 01:02:47,988
<b>I came to quell the rebels.</b>

664
01:02:48,282 --> 01:02:49,388
<b>What?</b>

665
01:02:49,512 --> 01:02:51,928
<b>I'll try my best to help you so that you can survive as a slave.</b>

666
01:02:52,652 --> 01:02:53,922
<b>But for me to do that,</b>

667
01:02:53,922 --> 01:02:56,167
<b>all your men must be killed as rebels.</b>

668
01:02:56,893 --> 01:02:58,127
<b>Why...</b>

669
01:02:58,963 --> 01:03:00,567
<b>Why are you doing this?</b>

670
01:03:03,632 --> 01:03:06,178
<b>I wanted to find a way to join hands with you.</b>

671
01:03:07,762 --> 01:03:10,333
<b>I wished to go to the new country...</b>

672
01:03:10,333 --> 01:03:11,477
<b>in Mount Dongmo...</b>

673
01:03:12,442 --> 01:03:13,948
<b>with you.</b>

674
01:03:17,543 --> 01:03:18,988
<b>But I got busted.</b>

675
01:03:19,043 --> 01:03:20,988
<b>And now, I must take your lives...</b>

676
01:03:22,253 --> 01:03:23,587
<b>to cover it up.</b>

677
01:03:24,583 --> 01:03:26,258
<b>After I bury all of it,</b>

678
01:03:27,282 --> 01:03:29,797
<b>I will pay for what I did with my own life.</b>

679
01:03:30,523 --> 01:03:32,437
<b>No, don't.</b>

680
01:03:37,862 --> 01:03:39,178
<b>Just save Man Weol.</b>

681
01:03:40,032 --> 01:03:41,433
<b>And to do that,</b>

682
01:03:41,433 --> 01:03:44,508
<b>you must live as a traitor instead of listing all the excuses...</b>

683
01:03:45,342 --> 01:03:46,877
<b>that you gave me.</b>

684
01:03:51,043 --> 01:03:52,618
<b>Then Man Weol will live.</b>

685
01:04:05,592 --> 01:04:07,937
<b>He made a promise to Yeon Woo.</b>

686
01:04:20,103 --> 01:04:22,948
<b>He's always been here.</b>

687
01:04:30,052 --> 01:04:33,758
<b>He was the first guest...</b>

688
01:04:34,853 --> 01:04:36,098
<b>that came to the Guest House of the Moon.</b>

689
01:04:39,722 --> 01:04:44,308
<b>You're not the only one who's been paying for the past sins here...</b>

690
01:04:45,532 --> 01:04:47,278
<b>all these years.</b>

691
01:05:31,313 --> 01:05:32,957
<b>Thanks to you, I made a great contribution.</b>

692
01:05:41,222 --> 01:05:42,598
<b>I will kill you.</b>

693
01:05:44,023 --> 01:05:45,698
<b>I will kill you...</b>

694
01:05:47,362 --> 01:05:48,607
<b>at all costs.</b>

695
01:05:51,833 --> 01:05:53,278
<b>If you wish to kill me,</b>

696
01:05:55,802 --> 01:05:57,578
<b>you will have to stay alive.</b>

697
01:07:04,972 --> 01:07:06,448
<b>You will live as a traitor.</b>

698
01:07:07,572 --> 01:07:09,317
<b>If you do that, Man Weol will live.</b>

699
01:07:38,503 --> 01:07:39,847
<b>I've been waiting for you.</b>

700
01:07:41,272 --> 01:07:44,887
<b>I hope there won't be any hesitation as you swing your sword at me.</b>

701
01:07:46,612 --> 01:07:47,788
<b>If so,</b>

702
01:07:48,982 --> 01:07:50,687
<b>I won't hesitate...</b>

703
01:07:52,152 --> 01:07:53,897
<b>to throw myself at the sword.</b>

704
01:08:27,652 --> 01:08:29,128
<b>You have never...</b>

705
01:08:30,453 --> 01:08:34,198
<b>uttered his name. Not even once.</b>

706
01:08:41,532 --> 01:08:42,948
<b>If you call for him,</b>

707
01:08:44,003 --> 01:08:45,677
<b>he will show himself.</b>

708
01:08:51,473 --> 01:08:53,387
<b>Have you been here the whole time?</b>

709
01:08:59,623 --> 01:09:01,727
<b>If so, show yourself to me.</b>

710
01:09:05,322 --> 01:09:06,538
<b>Ko Chung Myung.</b>

711
01:10:17,192 --> 01:10:19,278
<b>Tell me if there's anything else you wish to tell me.</b>

712
01:10:21,463 --> 01:10:22,807
<b>I'll listen to it.</b>

713
01:10:25,373 --> 01:10:27,448
<b>There's no more excuse to tell you.</b>

714
01:10:30,072 --> 01:10:31,217
<b>Man Weol.</b>

715
01:10:34,742 --> 01:10:36,628
<b>You told me in your last moment...</b>

716
01:10:38,083 --> 01:10:40,028
<b>that you would try to protect me.</b>

717
01:10:45,123 --> 01:10:49,208
<b>As I was chained to the Moon Tree and full of resentment,</b>

718
01:10:50,432 --> 01:10:52,078
<b>my words chained you here...</b>

719
01:10:55,503 --> 01:10:56,977
<b>and stopped you from leaving.</b>

720
01:11:07,942 --> 01:11:09,028
<b>I...</b>

721
01:11:12,253 --> 01:11:13,857
<b>have emptied everything now.</b>

722
01:11:19,263 --> 01:11:21,038
<b>So you should leave now.</b>

723
01:11:24,992 --> 01:11:26,307
<b>This is...</b>

724
01:11:30,402 --> 01:11:31,948
<b>the end for us.</b>

725
01:11:37,742 --> 01:11:38,887
<b>Yes.</b>

726
01:11:41,682 --> 01:11:43,057
<b>It's the end.</b>

727
01:13:12,602 --> 01:13:17,187
<b>His spirit doesn't have the energy to go to the afterlife.</b>

728
01:13:18,213 --> 01:13:20,757
<b>If we leave him here, he will cease to exist.</b>

729
01:13:21,942 --> 01:13:24,788
<b>He won't be able to have another life.</b>

730
01:13:29,423 --> 01:13:31,198
<b>To avoid that,</b>

731
01:13:33,022 --> 01:13:34,567
<b>you should...</b>

732
01:13:35,562 --> 01:13:36,668
<b>send him off.</b>

733
01:13:38,833 --> 01:13:42,708
<b>That is the last act of punishment...</b>

734
01:13:43,373 --> 01:13:45,177
<b>you will face here.</b>

735
01:15:39,623 --> 01:15:40,897
<b>Yeong Su.</b>

736
01:15:44,423 --> 01:15:45,637
<b>Are you up?</b>

737
01:15:46,822 --> 01:15:50,293
<b>You two got really drunk, so Mr. Ku told me to escort you home.</b>

738
01:15:50,293 --> 01:15:51,637
<b>So I called a taxi.</b>

739
01:15:52,503 --> 01:15:55,078
<b>Well, you two can go home on your own, right?</b>

740
01:15:55,873 --> 01:15:57,977
<b>- Yes. - Goodbye.</b>

741
01:16:04,213 --> 01:16:06,317
<b>Gosh, this again?</b>

742
01:16:07,383 --> 01:16:09,357
<b>When I came to the hotel the other day,</b>

743
01:16:09,553 --> 01:16:11,488
<b>she was the one who sent me home in a taxi.</b>

744
01:16:12,282 --> 01:16:15,597
<b>But this time, I remember up to drinking the cocktail.</b>

745
01:16:23,032 --> 01:16:24,668
<b>Yeong Su, why are you crying?</b>

746
01:16:24,932 --> 01:16:27,607
<b>I don't know. I feel sad.</b>

747
01:16:29,902 --> 01:16:33,748
<b>Seeing you cry like this is making me sad too.</b>

748
01:16:36,913 --> 01:16:38,488
<b>This is so weird.</b>

749
01:16:38,843 --> 01:16:40,418
<b>I'm right here. Why are you crying?</b>

750
01:16:41,543 --> 01:16:42,828
<b>Don't cry.</b>

751
01:16:54,332 --> 01:16:57,107
<b>Does he really have no intention of reconciling with me?</b>

752
01:17:10,912 --> 01:17:12,926
<b>We met for the first time...</b>

753
01:17:13,412 --> 01:17:14,857
<b>on May 2.</b>

754
01:17:41,712 --> 01:17:42,916
<b>I found it.</b>

755
01:17:49,782 --> 01:17:52,897
<b>This watch looks pretty old.</b>

756
01:17:53,021 --> 01:17:55,027
<b>It's over 70 years old.</b>

757
01:17:55,761 --> 01:17:57,691
<b>Time on that watch...</b>

758
01:17:57,691 --> 01:18:00,537
<b>has been flowing even when you were alive.</b>

759
01:18:00,632 --> 01:18:02,166
<b>These kinds of watches must be rare.</b>

760
01:18:02,962 --> 01:18:04,577
<b>It must've been hard to find one.</b>

761
01:18:06,132 --> 01:18:07,277
<b>Thank you.</b>

762
01:18:08,202 --> 01:18:10,317
<b>And I'm sorry.</b>

763
01:18:13,742 --> 01:18:15,471
<b>I wanted to let you know...</b>

764
01:18:15,471 --> 01:18:17,481
<b>that you're an old man who is 70 years older than me.</b>

765
01:18:17,481 --> 01:18:19,827
<b>It wasn't easy to get that watch.</b>

766
01:18:20,082 --> 01:18:23,126
<b>So from now on,</b>

767
01:18:23,351 --> 01:18:27,126
<b>even if I look older than you like your older sister,</b>

768
01:18:27,151 --> 01:18:30,796
<b>don't forget that you are way older than I am.</b>

769
01:18:34,091 --> 01:18:37,077
<b>Put it on your wrist. I'm sure it'll look great.</b>

770
01:18:39,431 --> 01:18:40,676
<b>Yu Na.</b>

771
01:18:41,172 --> 01:18:44,147
<b>I will leave soon.</b>

772
01:18:46,042 --> 01:18:48,586
<b>I told you that I was waiting for my sister, Hyun Mi.</b>

773
01:18:50,882 --> 01:18:54,056
<b>Right now, Hyun Mi is very sick.</b>

774
01:18:56,351 --> 01:18:57,796
<b>When she leaves,</b>

775
01:18:58,882 --> 01:19:00,367
<b>I must go with her.</b>

776
01:19:03,721 --> 01:19:04,897
<b>Yu Na,</b>

777
01:19:05,721 --> 01:19:09,067
<b>when this watch was made,</b>

778
01:19:10,962 --> 01:19:12,407
<b>I had already been dead.</b>

779
01:19:14,301 --> 01:19:16,046
<b>Time can't run...</b>

780
01:19:16,971 --> 01:19:19,817
<b>for the dead and for the living together.</b>

781
01:19:25,681 --> 01:19:27,857
<b>I had died a very long time ago.</b>

782
01:19:32,252 --> 01:19:33,766
<b>It's so upsetting.</b>

783
01:19:55,742 --> 01:19:57,187
<b>I'll see him off.</b>

784
01:19:59,612 --> 01:20:00,886
<b>You'll be back in a jiffy, right?</b>

785
01:20:02,822 --> 01:20:03,997
<b>Of course.</b>

786
01:20:04,551 --> 01:20:05,796
<b>I'll be back in a jiffy.</b>

01:20:26,912 --> 01:20:28,117
<b>You are coming back, right?</b>

788
01:20:36,051 --> 01:20:37,457
<b>Wait for me.</b>

<b>(A month later)</b>

791
01:21:52,992 --> 01:21:55,907
<b>Ma'am, let me help you</b>

792
01:21:59,771 --> 01:22:00,931
<b>Once you go out to the beach,</b>

793
01:22:00,931 --> 01:22:03,542
<b>you can rent any kinds of beach supplies.</b>

794
01:22:03,542 --> 01:22:04,771
<b>Let's go.</b>

795
01:22:04,771 --> 01:22:06,687
<b>- Thank you. - Thank you.</b>

796
01:22:14,612 --> 01:22:16,027
<b>It looks like you've made progress.</b>

797
01:22:17,221 --> 01:22:18,527
<b>Could you read it for me?</b>

798
01:22:24,061 --> 01:22:28,266
<b>It's been a month since Ms. Jang left.</b>

799
01:22:28,492 --> 01:22:30,037
<b>Ms. Jang isn't here.</b>

800
01:22:31,061 --> 01:22:33,306
<b>But how come the hotel hasn't vanished yet?</b>

801
01:22:33,332 --> 01:22:35,301
<b>It means that Ms. Jang is no longer...</b>

802
01:22:35,301 --> 01:22:37,317
<b>the owner of Guest House of the Moon.</b>

803
01:22:38,341 --> 01:22:40,346
<b>That's my guess.</b>

804
01:22:44,941 --> 01:22:46,157
<b>Mr. Ku.</b>

805
01:22:47,712 --> 01:22:50,096
<b>I think you should head to the garden.</b>

806
01:22:57,922 --> 01:22:59,136
<b>Yesterday,</b>

807
01:22:59,792 --> 01:23:02,207
<b>I saw a few leaves and flowers.</b>

808
01:23:02,731 --> 01:23:04,407
<b>But the tree is completely lifeless now.</b>

809
01:23:07,801 --> 01:23:09,147
<b>I guess...</b>

810
01:23:09,771 --> 01:23:12,886
<b>that means Ms. Jang can't come back for good now.</b>

811
01:23:51,882 --> 01:23:53,327
<b>Wait for me.</b>

812
01:24:09,061 --> 01:24:10,376
<b>Ms. Jang.</b>

813
01:24:12,632 --> 01:24:13,876
<b>Come back quickly.</b>

814
01:24:15,301 --> 01:24:16,516
<b>I'm getting...</b>

815
01:24:19,072 --> 01:24:20,416
<b>anxious now.</b>

816
01:24:28,212 --> 01:24:31,997
<b>All of us are against having a new owner.</b>

817
01:24:32,822 --> 01:24:34,897
<b>Help Ms. Jang return.</b>

818
01:24:38,261 --> 01:24:39,537
<b>I'm with them.</b>

819
01:24:40,632 --> 01:24:43,601
<b>It took me 500 years to get used to Ms. Jang.</b>

820
01:24:43,601 --> 01:24:46,107
<b>Having another boss? I'm against it.</b>

821
01:24:48,532 --> 01:24:51,716
<b>It is up to her to return to this place or not.</b>

822
01:24:51,742 --> 01:24:55,147
<b>There's no way she won't come back when Mr. Ku is waiting for her.</b>

823
01:24:56,742 --> 01:24:58,586
<b>If she set foot on the bridge,</b>

824
01:24:59,511 --> 01:25:01,256
<b>she might have forgotten him.</b>

825
01:26:47,051 --> 01:26:49,426
<b>You can let go of all your memories of this world...</b>

826
01:26:50,792 --> 01:26:52,796
<b>and cross the bridge...</b>

827
01:26:54,132 --> 01:26:55,966
<b>toward your most distant memories.</b>

828
01:27:05,072 --> 01:27:07,886
<b>Is that why all the flowers wilted?</b>

829
01:27:08,372 --> 01:27:10,957
<b>Then I guess the tree is really dead now.</b>

830
01:27:11,742 --> 01:27:12,857
<b>Right.</b>

831
01:27:14,282 --> 01:27:16,287
<b>All the flowers wilted and disappeared.</b>

832
01:27:17,221 --> 01:27:18,357
<b>I suppose Jang Man Weol...</b>

833
01:27:19,452 --> 01:27:21,426
<b>is really dead now.</b>

834
01:27:28,561 --> 01:27:31,277
<b>Should we be expecting a new owner of the Guest House of the Moon?</b>

835
01:27:34,332 --> 01:27:38,376
<b>The Moon Tree is the owner of the guest house.</b>

836
01:27:38,771 --> 01:27:42,787
<b>But all the flowers and leaves are gone. It's dead now.</b>

<b>("The Guys Who Died After Eating")</b>

838
01:28:14,872 --> 01:28:16,787
<b>It's piping hot.</b>

839
01:28:17,082 --> 01:28:19,457
<b>But Kim Joon Hyun ate five of this at once.</b>

840
01:28:19,882 --> 01:28:21,556
<b>It was so fascinating.</b>

841
01:28:22,782 --> 01:28:25,397
<b>That's where he sat.</b>

842
01:28:26,181 --> 01:28:27,322
<b>Eat before it gets cold.</b>

843
01:28:27,322 --> 01:28:28,792
<b>(Kim Joon Hyun sat here.)</b>

01:28:28,792 --> 01:28:29,922
<b>(Ms. Jang Man Weol, I love you.)</b>

845
01:28:29,922 --> 01:28:32,466
<b>"Ms. Jang Man Weol, I love you"?</b>

846
01:28:33,132 --> 01:28:34,231
<b>Are you not happy?</b>

847
01:28:34,231 --> 01:28:35,462
<b>Are you professing your love to me?</b>

848
01:28:35,462 --> 01:28:37,707
<b>This is Kim Joon Hyun's autograph. Here, "Kim Joon Hyun".</b>

849
01:28:38,731 --> 01:28:41,147
<b>It's heartbreaking if I remain only as a flower petal...</b>

850
01:28:42,431 --> 01:28:43,876
<b>that's bound to vanish.</b>

<b>(I'll check out all the good restaurants in the country!)</b>

852
01:29:47,601 --> 01:29:51,647
<b>Not all of the flowers perished.</b>

853
01:29:56,612 --> 01:29:58,886
<b>There are still some flowers left.</b>

854
01:30:07,551 --> 01:30:09,666
<b>I put the flowers dreaming of the moon...</b>

<b>in there.</b>
