<b>Thank you for telling me</b>

<b>before things got out of hand.</b>

<b>nothing to do

59

<b>Why did Ms. Jung</b>

<b>willfully approach you

61
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,056
<b>Wasn't it so that</b>

<b>she could illegally

63
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:10,602
<b>No, sir.</b>

64
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:17,609
<b>It's true that I felt</b>

65
00:05:19,278 --> 00:05:21,446
<b>a sexual attraction to Mr. Yoon.</b>

66
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:25,367
<b>I didn't think he'd see me
if I told him who I really was.</b>

67
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,538
<b>It was my way of getting to know him.</b>

68
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:33,333
<b>That's ridiculous.
He was the opposing lawyer.</b>

69
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:38,714
<b>No one can blame us for falling in love
even if that person killed your family.</b>

70
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:43,468
<b>Have you not read a romance novel
or watched a romantic movie before?</b>

71
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:49,057
<b>So you're saying
that you two were in love?</b>

72
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:50,517
<b>Yes.</b>

73
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:52,269
<b>Yes.</b>

74
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:54,271
<b>-We were.
-We were.</b>

75
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:03,739
<b>Then do you admit
that you both shared information?</b>

76
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:05,991
<b>-No.
-No.</b>

77
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,743
<b>-We never did.
-We never did.</b>

78
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:08,952
<b>Ms. Jung.</b>

79
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:11,705
<b>Then how did you come across
Ha Chan-ho's personal information?</b>

80
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,874
<b>It acted as conclusive evidence
for the divorce suit.</b>

81
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:16,752
<b>I'm</b>

82
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:18,503
<b>just</b>

83
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:22,299
<b>extremely competent.</b>

84
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,221
<b>That's how good she is.</b>

85
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:32,059
<b>She sometimes does things
that other lawyers can't.</b>

86
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,102
<b>She obviously fooled you
to get that information.</b>

87
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:35,354
<b>Do you have evidence?</b>

88
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:39,441
<b>It's obvious judging by the circumstances.</b>

89
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:42,861
<b>Then you can go ahead and think that
based on the circumstantial evidence.</b>

90
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:45,489
<b>I never</b>

91
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:47,866
<b>gave her</b>

92
00:06:49,368 --> 00:06:50,494
<b>my client's information.</b>

93
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:54,623
<b>Ms. Jung.</b>

94
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:59,044
<b>As a lawyer, I'm obligated to keep
my client's information confidential.</b>

95
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:01,171
<b>So I can't tell you everything.</b>

96
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,048
<b>But one thing is for sure.</b>

97
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:07,844
<b>Mr. Yoon and I never once
shared any information.</b>

98
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,862
<b>How did they find out about Kim Hee-sun?</b>

99
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,035
<b>We all have our reasons for doing things.</b>

100
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:35,247
<b>What an amazing friendship you have.</b>

101
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:39,626
<b>I want to know what you said.</b>

102
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,503
<b>I bet they asked the same stuff.</b>

103
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,130
<b>Is that really important?</b>

104
00:07:43,714 --> 00:07:45,674
<b>What do you think the result will be?</b>

105
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:48,427
<b>If there are no variables,
it'll get rejected.</b>

106
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,638
<b>There's one variable, though.</b>

107
00:07:51,722 --> 00:07:52,764
<b>Song Pil-jung.</b>

108
00:07:57,144 --> 00:08:01,314
<b>This isn't merely about
two lawyers dating each other.</b>

109
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,570
<b>It's about trust,
which is the most fundamental thing</b>

110
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:08,530
<b>that a lawyer needs to keep.</b>

111
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:11,533
<b>Then do you want this to end quietly?</b>

112
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:15,037
<b>If the reporters find out,
it'll harm your firm's reputation--</b>

113
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,999
<b>He's willing to risk that
and wants you to make a proper judgment.</b>

114
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:21,835
<b>Mr. Song cares about
the overall legal field.</b>

115
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:25,338
<b>Okay, I understand what you mean.</b>

116
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:27,257
<b>He thinks the decision
you're going to make</b>

117
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:32,554
<b>will act as a great example
regarding the work ethics of lawyers.</b>

118
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:51,865
<b>Congratulations, Mr. Ha Jun-ho.
You're now the CEO of Issume.</b>

119
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:54,451
<b>This is all thanks to you.</b>

120
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,535
<b>Don't mention it.</b>

121
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:59,790
<b>This was possible
because you have what it takes.</b>

122
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,459
<b>I guess other people disagree.</b>

123
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:08,256
<b>Why would you say that
when we're gathered here to celebrate?</b>

124
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,092
<b>The stock price is plummeting.</b>

125
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:13,970
<b>It shows that people don't trust
the new CEO of Issume.</b>

126
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,182
<b>The company will disappear at this rate.</b>

127
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:22,521
<b>The stock price will recover with time.</b>

128
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:25,315
<b>Issume has gone through a lot,
but I know it'll endure it.</b>

129
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,775
<b>That's how sturdy Issume is.</b>

130
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:34,282
<b>I guess I didn't know much about Issume
seeing that I was so worried.</b>

131
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:35,492
<b>Hye-won!</b>

132
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,246
<b>Do you even know
what you're going to have to deal with?</b>

133
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,417
<b>You should help him out.</b>

134
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:46,878
<b>Don't be so mean to him
like you were with Chan-ho.</b>

135
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:49,673
<b>-Dad.
-Do it for Issume.</b>

136
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,051
<b>We're going through hard times,
so we need to overcome it together.</b>

137
00:09:53,135 --> 00:09:54,427
<b>That's what you call family.</b>

138
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:58,098
<b>"Family"?</b>

139
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:12,404
<b>Don't worry too much, sir.</b>

140
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:13,822
<b>Pil-jung.</b>

141
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:16,533
<b>When did we</b>

142
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:18,743
<b>first meet?</b>

143
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:23,165
<b>I can't even remember.</b>

144
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:25,000
<b>Sir.</b>

145
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:30,714
<b>Well...</b>

146
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,800
<b>What do you think will happen
with Supreme Court Justice Yoon?</b>

147
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:37,345
<b>He worked as a judge for over 30 years.</b>

148
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:41,349
<b>It'll be humiliating for him
to even stand in court as a defendant.</b>

149
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,810
<b>He won't say anything to harm Issume.</b>

150
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:46,646
<b>If he does,
he'll be denying his own verdict</b>

151
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,232
<b>and his career as a judge.</b>

152
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:53,904
<b>Okay, hurry up
and take care of what happened</b>

153
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,447
<b>with Chan-ho as well.</b>

154
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:57,282
<b>Okay, sir.</b>

<b>I want to get some rest. You should go.</b>

156
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:02,954
<b>Get some rest, sir.</b>

157
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:18,178
<b>-What are you doing?
-I thought we got fired.</b>

158

<b>Not yet.</b>

159
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:21,473
<b>"Not yet"?</b>

160
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,477
<b>Then when?</b>

161
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,896
<b>The disciplinary committee
will need time to make a decision.</b>

162

<b>I'm suspicious of everything that
Seo Jeong-hwa did on the day she died.</b>

163
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:35,028
<b>She's still thinking about her?</b>

164
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:43,787
<b>She told Han Su-jeong
that she's going to leave with Ha Jun-ho.</b>

165

<b>HA JUN-HO, SEO JEONG-HWA

167
00:11:50,085 --> 00:11:51,211
<b>"The painting"?</b>

168
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:54,881
<b>Seo Jeong-hwa
was looking after a painting.</b>

169
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:58,468
<b>She was going to sell that

<b>Ms. Jung.</b>

171
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:03,014
<b>How was she going to sell it

172
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:05,141
<b>She was only looking after it.</b>

173
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:13,233
<b>She was looking after a painting.</b>

174
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:17,404
<b>What did Seo Jeong-hwa always do?</b>

175
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:19,823
<b>Money laundering.</b>

176
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:21,908
<b>Yes.</b>

177
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,371
<b>It's highly possible that it was
someone's slush fund.</b>

178

<b>A slush fund?</b>

179
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:33,920
<b>And why do you think
she went to Yeonan Pier?</b>

180
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,923
<b>She wouldn't have gone there
to eat sashimi all by herself.</b>

181

<b>And then White Hotel.</b>

<b>The drug test results.</b>

183
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:43,555
<b>She took sleeping pills with alcohol.</b>

00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:47,267
<b>But neither Ha Chan-ho

185
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,602
<b>I know she hated drugs,</b>

186
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:52,397
<b>but she could've secretly brought it
to sedate Ha Chan-ho.</b>

187
00:12:57,027 --> 00:13:01,239
<b>Ha Chan-ho found Seo Jeong-hwa by
tracking the GPS device on her cell phone.</b>

<b>Ha Chan-ho called Seo Jeong-hwa
at 7:20 p.m.</b>

<b>And he entered White Hotel at 8:00 p.m.</b>

190
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:17,380
<b>She wouldn't have had enough time to get

<b>Room service.</b>

192
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:26,556
<b>Either the person who brought room service
brought the sleeping pills,</b>

193

<b>or that person
secretly put them in their drinks.</b>

194
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:30,935
<b>Did you find out who it was?</b>

195
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:34,230
<b>No, it wasn't a hotel staff.
The person was from another company.</b>

<b>Mr. Na is busy making phone calls.</b>

200

<b>Who owns White Hotel again?</b>

<b>White Corporation.</b>

204
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:02,300
<b>Mr. Kim, I want you

<b>Aren't you going to come

208
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:14,437
<b><i>Yes, it's about Ha Chan-ho.</i></b>

<b>Did Mr. Ga gather the meeting?</b>

210
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,736
<b>-Yes.
-Okay, I got it.</b>

211
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:33,623

<b>PARK JU-HO</b>

<b>Ha Jun-ho?</b>

215

<b>The newly appointed CEO of Issume Group?</b>

<b>Didn't you know?</b>

217
00:14:57,564 --> 00:15:00,900
<b>Ms. Jung and Mr. Yoon

<b>The relationship between Seo Jeong-hwa,
Ha Jun-ho, and Ha Chan-ho.</b>

219
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:07,073
<b>So she was cheating with Ha Jun-ho?</b>

220
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:10,743
<b>I mean, CEO Ha?</b>

221
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,497
<b>If the trial lasts too long,
people will start talking.</b>

222
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:16,207
<b>We already have enough rumors as it is.</b>

223
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,835
<b>It won't be good

<b>Hey, Mr. Ma.</b>

228
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:40,648
<b>When will the disciplinary committee
come up with a decision?</b>

229
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:42,817
<b>I did ask them to hurry.</b>

230

<b>-When is the EP general meeting?
-<i>In 15 days, sir.</i></b>

<b>That's not important right now.</b>

233

<b>Fifteen days?</b>

<b>It'll be too late.

<b>Okay, sir. What is the agenda?</b>

236
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:04,506
<b>The expulsion of Ms. Jung and Mr. Yoon.</b>

237

<b>Okay, sir.</b>

238
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:28,738
<b>I'm sure you've all heard,

<b>from now on.</b>

240
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:35,078
<b>Mr. Yoon and Ms. Jung

<b>until the disciplinary committee
tells them their final decision.</b>

242
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:39,958
<b>Why was the disciplinary hearing held?</b>

243
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:41,626
<b>Do you know?</b>

244

<b>Everyone in the firm knows.
Why are you so slow?</b>

245
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,675
<b>First, let's check what's going on.</b>

246
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:51,094
<b>Please tell me

<b>-I was given a task a while ago.
-"A while ago"?</b>

249
00:16:57,392 --> 00:17:01,104
<b>I was told to check White Hotel's history

<b>"White Hotel"? Why?</b>

251
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,737
<b>-What about you, Ms. Boo?
-I'm looking into ArtSky's clients.</b>

252
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,032
<b>I'm searching for the guy

<b>I see.</b>

254
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:19,038
<b>I want all of you to stop

<b>We're going to go

<b>Keep it short and safe.</b>

257
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:28,548
<b>One mistake can turn it into murder.</b>

258
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:30,883
<b>So we're going to admit that he's guilty?</b>

259
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:34,053
<b>He was caught red-handed
at the crime scene.</b>

260

<b>You know what that means.</b>

261
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:38,099
<b>Then what about the work we put in--</b>

262
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:39,809
<b>We don't have time.</b>

263
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:44,022
<b>What do you mean

264

<b>I'm saying he had a good enough reason

<b>They were in a love triangle.</b>

<b>It's too obvious.</b>

269
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:08,546

00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,763
<b>You see,</b>

456
00:32:05,185 --> 00:32:07,979
<b>the only thing I can do now
is wrapping this up as soon as possible.</b>

457
00:32:09,856 --> 00:32:11,691
<b>That is my task.</b>

458
00:32:14,569 --> 00:32:17,697
<b>Becoming a partner at Song & Kim...</b>

459
00:32:18,657 --> 00:32:20,033
<b>It's very cool.</b>

460
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:24,621
<b>Your parents will be proud of you.</b>

461
00:32:25,038 --> 00:32:26,665
<b>Everyone around you will be.</b>

462

<b>Hee-jae.</b>

463
00:32:34,297 --> 00:32:35,465
<b>I guess...</b>

464
00:32:37,676 --> 00:32:39,594
<b>we might end up meeting
in the courtroom one day.</b>

465
00:32:43,306 --> 00:32:44,349
<b>If that ever happens,</b>

466
00:32:45,767 --> 00:32:46,768
<b>I won't go easy on you.</b>

467
00:32:59,906 --> 00:33:01,241
<b>We're still friends, right?</b>

468
00:34:55,522 --> 00:34:57,440
<b>Gosh.</b>

469
00:34:58,149 --> 00:35:01,861
<b>I'm sad that
you're actually leaving the firm.</b>

470
00:35:02,403 --> 00:35:04,531
<b>I have to say,
you've definitely grown on me.</b>

471
00:35:05,573 --> 00:35:07,575
<b>Well, do you have another job lined up?</b>

472
00:35:08,117 --> 00:35:09,577
<b>Oh, right.</b>

473
00:35:10,578 --> 00:35:14,082
<b>There will be many law firms

<b>And as for you, you're a tough lady.</b>

475
00:35:19,462 --> 00:35:21,381
<b>We'll meet again, wherever that may be.</b>

476
00:35:21,464 --> 00:35:22,590
<b>So don't be sad.</b>

477
00:35:53,246 --> 00:35:55,415
<b>You were going to leave
without even saying goodbye?</b>

478
00:36:00,253 --> 00:36:04,674
<b>I'm very sad
that we're letting you go like this.</b>

479
00:36:05,925 --> 00:36:07,510
<b>However,</b>

480
00:36:08,011 --> 00:36:12,056
<b>I had to put the firm before you

481
00:36:13,016 --> 00:36:14,017
<b>I hope you understand.</b>

482
00:36:19,647 --> 00:36:21,524
<b>If I get reprimanded by the association,</b>

483
00:36:21,774 --> 00:36:24,485
<b>I'll protest and appeal
to the Ministry of Justice.</b>

484

<b>They haven't notified me
of their decision,</b>

485
00:36:27,113 --> 00:36:28,573
<b>but I think I know what it'll be.</b>

486
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:32,911
<b>I'm sure they're busy trying to figure out

<b>-Hee-jae--

490
00:36:43,338 --> 00:36:46,466
<b>Yes, he'll be able to trust you

491

-Call Mr. Song.</b>

522
00:38:56,637 --> 00:38:58,639
<b>What was that about? Good news for us?</b>

523
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:01,726
<b>Well, it's not bad news.</b>

524
00:39:02,518 --> 00:39:04,520

525
00:39:07,523 --> 00:39:08,900
<b>Oh, right.</b>

526
00:39:10,068 --> 00:39:11,527

<b>-I was just--

<b>You obviously don't know her well at all.</b>

541
00:40:10,503 --> 00:40:11,712

<b>What's done is done,

<b>But to outdo Chairman Ha's family,</b>

<b>If I step in and reveal myself,</b>

<b>-It's been a while, Kevin.

<b>You couldn't even wait

<b>You're wining and dining here,

<b>How did you get to where you are now?</b>

576

<b>Chairman Ha introduced you to my father.</b>

<b>-Kim Min-joo.
-That's all you are.</b>

<b>A mutt raised by my family.</b>

580

<b>You think you've become someone worthy,</b>

581

<b>but that's not the case.

<b>Shut the fuck up!</b>

583
00:42:35,564 --> 00:42:36,649
<b>That's right.</b>

584
00:42:37,233 --> 00:42:39,235
<b>That's the Song Pil-jung I know.</b>

585

<b>No wonder my sister

<b>It's too bad you missed.</b>

587

<b>I would've sued your ass

<b>Anyway, wrap up your conversation.</b>

<b>Just so you know though,</b>

590
00:43:07,888 --> 00:43:10,224
<b>I am going to take a stance this time.</b>

591

<b>Are you done being

<b>That rich spoiled kid

<b>You gave me that nickname

<b>Besides, a rich spoiled kid?</b>

601
00:44:09,617 --> 00:44:11,744
<b>-You're so--
-There was someone else.</b>

<b>Someone other than Ha Chan-ho</b>

608
00:44:33,224 --> 00:44:34,725
