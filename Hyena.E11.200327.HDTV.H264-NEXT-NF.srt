<b>Don't get greedy. Be reasonable

<b>Then I'll let you continue your business.</b>

156

<b>I'll also withdraw the suit.</b>

157
00:12:40,569 --> 00:12:44,990
<b>But of course,
you'll have to compensate your daughter.</b>

158

<b>Why should I listen to you?</b>

<b>So why don't you ask your god why?</b>

161
00:12:50,996 --> 00:12:53,039
<b>Or I could just call an investment analyst</b>

162

<b>and tell that person everything about you.</b>

163

<b><i>First, here's the title I came up with.</i></b>

<b>"The Revised Inheritance Tax
and Gift Tax Act"</b>

273

<b>which will vitalize the succession
of family businesses for competitive firms</b>

274

<b>which will then lead to more employment

<b>It's cliché, but I like it.</b>

<b>All great laws are cliché.</b>

277
00:19:38,903 --> 00:19:42,740
<b>First, we'll include large corporations
by getting rid of the sales regulation,</b>

<b>and then adjust three things.</b>

<b>The extent of deduction,

<b>and the follow-up requirements.</b>

<b>How do you plan to adjust them?</b>

282

<b>Raise the extent of deduction
to 200 billion won.</b>

<b>Have over five years

<b>That's right.</b>

286

<b>The point is to help them inherit

00:20:55,563 --> 00:20:56,898
<b>It's very daring. I like it.</b>

306
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,859
<b>The process will be daring as well.</b>

307
00:21:00,568 --> 00:21:01,527
<b>Are you okay with that?</b>

308
00:21:01,611 --> 00:21:04,322
<b>It'll be risky even if
we don't do anything.</b>

309
00:21:05,281 --> 00:21:09,619
<b>As the head of Song & Kim,
it's a dereliction of duty to stay quiet</b>

310
00:21:10,453 --> 00:21:12,955
<b>when there's a problem
with our country's legal system.</b>

311
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,334
<b>I should endure the aftermath.</b>

312
00:21:17,669 --> 00:21:20,213
<b>It'll be better to table the bill
along with the other bills</b>

313
00:21:20,296 --> 00:21:23,591
<b>rather than attract attention to it
by proposing it on its own.</b>

314
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:28,012
<b>You should meet Congressman Lee In-yeop</b>

315
00:21:28,596 --> 00:21:30,682
<b>before tabling the bill.</b>

316
00:21:31,265 --> 00:21:33,017
<b>Do it quietly. Keep it confidential.</b>

317
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:34,894
<b>Okay, sir.</b>

318
00:21:37,146 --> 00:21:38,606
<b>Is everything okay with Ms. Jung?</b>

319
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:42,652
<b>Well, yes.</b>

320
00:21:46,823 --> 00:21:48,032
<b><i>Hee-jae.</i></b>

321
00:21:48,116 --> 00:21:50,952
<b><i>It's important to focus on
how useful that person is going to be.</i></b>

322
00:21:51,661 --> 00:21:55,123
<b>Your preference shouldn't be the priority.
That way, you won't miss your chance.</b>

323
00:21:55,623 --> 00:21:59,001
<b>The chance to keep that person near you
and the chance to get rid of them.</b>

324
00:22:00,086 --> 00:22:01,796
<b>One day, you'll get what you want.</b>

325
00:22:01,879 --> 00:22:04,924
<b>But until then,
keep Ms. Jung by your side.</b>

326
00:22:05,758 --> 00:22:07,635
<b>You need to keep her a lot closer.</b>

327
00:22:15,852 --> 00:22:18,020
<b>Are you really going to file a suit?</b>

328
00:22:18,271 --> 00:22:19,147
<b>What do you think?</b>

329
00:22:20,815 --> 00:22:22,775
<b>What Baek Un-mi wants is important.</b>

330
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:24,736
<b>But that's not our goal.</b>

331
00:22:24,819 --> 00:22:27,363
<b>But think about
how much this will hurt her.</b>

332
00:22:27,447 --> 00:22:28,406
<b>What if...</b>

333
00:22:28,865 --> 00:22:30,658
<b>And I know this won't ever happen.</b>

334
00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:32,785
<b>But what if we lose?</b>

335
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,333
<b>What would I know?</b>

336
00:22:41,544 --> 00:22:42,545
<b>This is delicious.</b>

337
00:22:43,421 --> 00:22:44,547
<b>We're not filing a suit.</b>

338
00:22:45,173 --> 00:22:46,257
<b>Pardon?</b>

339
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:50,094
<b>I know for a fact that she'll call.
She'll be holding a white flag.</b>

340
00:22:51,554 --> 00:22:52,889
<b>So let's</b>

341
00:22:53,973 --> 00:22:55,975
<b>eat up and be ready for victory.</b>

342
00:22:56,392 --> 00:22:57,310
<b>Okay.</b>

343
00:23:02,648 --> 00:23:03,900
<b>Is it Baek Hee-jun?</b>

344
00:23:05,234 --> 00:23:07,069
<b>Hello, this is Jung Geum-ja
from Song & Kim.</b>

345
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,614
<b>It's me, Baek Hee-jun.</b>

346
00:23:10,239 --> 00:23:11,616
<b>Hello, Ms. Baek.</b>

347
00:23:12,116 --> 00:23:14,035
<b>First, I'd like to meet.</b>

348
00:23:16,996 --> 00:23:18,372
<b>When should we meet?</b>

349
00:23:24,253 --> 00:23:25,922
<b>INHERITANCE TAX AND GIFT TAX ACT</b>

350
00:23:27,423 --> 00:23:31,552
<b>The writer and director seem to have
no consideration at all for the actor.</b>

351
00:23:33,805 --> 00:23:37,308
<b>Judging by your silence, I guess
that means I can't ask for any changes.</b>

352
00:23:38,476 --> 00:23:39,811
<b>Am I correct?</b>

353
00:23:40,269 --> 00:23:41,354
<b>Yes.</b>

354
00:23:42,522 --> 00:23:43,648
<b>As you already know,</b>

355
00:23:44,607 --> 00:23:47,819
<b>there's a long way to go
before this reaches the plenary session.</b>

356
00:23:48,694 --> 00:23:51,364
<b>We need to go through at least ten steps.</b>

357
00:23:53,074 --> 00:23:55,618
<b>Do you think we'll be able
to get it done quietly?</b>

358
00:23:57,829 --> 00:24:02,166
<b>The world isn't exactly as peaceful
as this temple.</b>

359
00:24:05,711 --> 00:24:08,422
<b>All the other bills that were
adjusted by Song & Kim</b>

360
00:24:08,506 --> 00:24:10,174
<b>had to go through the same process.</b>

361
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:13,511
<b>Fortunately, we received help...</b>

362
00:24:13,594 --> 00:24:16,556
<b>No, we were led by people like you,
and that's how we won.</b>

363
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:22,186
<b>That's what determined whether or not
they became our clients.</b>

364
00:24:23,229 --> 00:24:24,564
<b>Mr. Song really wants this.</b>

365
00:24:25,106 --> 00:24:28,192
<b>That's all I can say for now.</b>

366
00:24:34,031 --> 00:24:35,491
<b>I thought you were a cattle dog,</b>

368
00:24:40,663 --> 00:24:44,876
<b>You're the best at Song & Kim,
so I guess I'll trust you.</b>

<b>MR. SONG PIL-JUNG</b>

<b>Sir, I just met with Congressman Lee.</b>

371
00:25:02,143 --> 00:25:03,519
<b>How did he react?</b>

372
00:25:03,603 --> 00:25:07,273
<b>We're going to proceed with it as planned.
But he does seem a little worried.</b>

373
00:25:10,026 --> 00:25:11,527
<b>This is a huge deal.</b>

374
00:25:12,278 --> 00:25:14,405
<b>So I bet he doesn't want to attract
people's attention.</b>

<b><i>His public image
means a great deal to him.</i></b>

376
00:25:18,409 --> 00:25:19,952
<b>Anyway, all right. Thanks.</b>

377
00:25:20,953 --> 00:25:23,080
<b>Of course. Have a good day, sir.</b>

<b><i>The judge in charge</i></b>

<b><i>Are you getting married?</i></b>

<b>What are you talking about?</b>

392
00:26:26,644 --> 00:26:28,604
<b>If that's not the case,
this is just weird.</b>

393
00:26:29,063 --> 00:26:29,939
<b>What's weird?</b>

394
00:26:30,022 --> 00:26:32,900

00:26:41,575 --> 00:26:42,785
<b>What the hell.</b>

399
00:26:45,788 --> 00:26:46,747
<b>Sorry.</b>

400
00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:49,291
<b>Did someone call you a dog?</b>

401
00:26:49,375 --> 00:26:52,420
<b>Don't laugh. I'm serious right now.</b>

402
00:26:55,464 --> 00:26:57,925
<b>I suppose you're asking

403
00:26:59,343 --> 00:27:01,303
<b>You didn't have to spell it out like that.</b>

404

<b>What? Do you feel shitty

<b>Hee-jae.</b>

409
00:27:21,157 --> 00:27:23,492
<b>Okay. Let's drop this topic.</b>

410

<b>Finish your food.</b>

411
00:27:25,453 --> 00:27:26,871
<b>I lost my appetite.</b>

412
00:27:28,122 --> 00:27:29,999
<b>And wouldn't you say
this is a type of hypocrisy?</b>

413
00:27:30,082 --> 00:27:31,751
<b>Do you want to look like a commoner?</b>

<b>You're not exactly a commoner.</b>

416

<b>That's why I should be
even more mindful and careful.</b>

417
00:27:42,428 --> 00:27:44,096
<b>Because I've been enjoying

<b>Let's not take it for granted

<b>I'm going to keep doing things my way.</b>

422

<b>Why do you keep canceling
your appointment with Ms. Baek?</b>

<b>This is the third time.</b>

<b>What will you do if she changes her mind?</b>

425

<b>She won't.</b>

426
00:28:40,861 --> 00:28:43,155
<b>In fact, it'll make her more anxious.</b>

427
00:28:45,991 --> 00:28:47,576
<b>How much has it gone up by?</b>

428
00:28:48,619 --> 00:28:50,496
<b>It's going up rapidly.</b>

429
00:28:50,663 --> 00:28:53,791
<b>The price might end up being way too high
in about a month.</b>

<b>The amount may be less

456
00:30:58,506 --> 00:31:01,384
<b>I'd like to keep this short,
so I'll get right to the point.</b>

457
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:03,428
<b>Go ahead.</b>

458
00:31:04,178 --> 00:31:07,432
<b>Issume Pharmaceuticals can buy Gnosis.</b>

459

<b>What are the conditions?</b>

460
00:31:14,689 --> 00:31:18,026
<b>Pay twice the amount AP EON promised.</b>

461
00:31:18,484 --> 00:31:21,696
<b>As you know,
when Gnosis' market value is revealed,</b>

462
00:31:21,821 --> 00:31:23,948
<b>you won't be able to buy it
even with a lot more money.</b>

463
00:31:24,991 --> 00:31:28,286
<b>And if one of your
international competitors acquires it...</b>

464
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:30,913
<b>Is that the only condition?</b>

465
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:46,012
<b>Desert Song Pil-jung.
Partner up with me instead.</b>

466

<b>I am aware that
it's an unexpected, rude request.</b>

467
00:31:51,851 --> 00:31:52,977
<b>It is rude.</b>

468
00:31:53,853 --> 00:31:58,149
<b>Mr. Song and I go back a long way.</b>

469
00:32:06,407 --> 00:32:08,785
<b>But I must say, this is interesting.</b>

470
00:32:11,204 --> 00:32:15,083
<b>It'll be interesting to see how things
will change. It'll be entertaining.</b>

471
00:32:16,125 --> 00:32:17,210
<b>Right?</b>

472
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:21,422
<b>Well, then...</b>

473
00:32:22,632 --> 00:32:25,093
<b>Proceed with it. I'll be watching.</b>

474

<b>And Ms. Kim...</b>

475
00:32:41,025 --> 00:32:43,236
<b>Hello. Let's go in.</b>

476
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:46,698
<b>You go in first.</b>

477
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:50,785
<b>I see that you're doing very well

478
00:32:51,994 --> 00:32:53,538
<b>I always do well.</b>

479
00:32:55,915 --> 00:32:58,835
<b>Attorney Jung is the star of the case,
not you.</b>

480
00:32:59,419 --> 00:33:01,129
<b>Yoon Hee-jae is just a sidekick?</b>

481
00:33:02,922 --> 00:33:04,006
<b>It doesn't suit you.</b>

482

<b>I'm working on something
very important as per Mr. Song's order.</b>

483

<b>And as you know,</b>

484
00:33:13,057 --> 00:33:16,894
<b>Attorney Jung took such great care
of what Ms. Kim asked her to do.</b>

485
00:33:19,105 --> 00:33:20,815
<b>You think this will last forever,
don't you?</b>

486
00:33:21,315 --> 00:33:25,111
<b>I heard that team makes people
forget their places at first.</b>

487
00:33:26,362 --> 00:33:27,655
<b>Be careful.</b>

488
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:31,659
<b>You'd better prepare
a safety net in case you fall.</b>

489
00:33:31,993 --> 00:33:35,371
<b>You've already fallen,
so I shall remember your advice.</b>

490
00:33:35,872 --> 00:33:36,831
<b>See you.</b>

491
00:33:38,541 --> 00:33:39,542
<b>Hey, wait.</b>

492
00:33:39,625 --> 00:33:41,002
<b>You little...</b>

493
00:33:47,258 --> 00:33:48,384

<b>You've agreed to never request money again</b>

498
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:31,844
<b>or take legal action regarding
this matter. You remember that, right?</b>

499
00:34:32,887 --> 00:34:36,516
<b>I know I agreed to be used, but why do I
feel like I was forced to panhandle?</b>

500
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:38,100
<b>I have to say, it feels pretty shitty.</b>

501

<b>The money will be deposited in a few days.</b>

502

<b>You're getting a billion won.

<b>So? This is it?</b>

504
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:50,571
<b>Of course not.</b>

505
00:34:53,157 --> 00:34:56,869
<b>You'll have to do something

<b>Mr. Yoon.</b>

00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:16,097
<b>I didn't expect to see you here.</b>

509
00:35:17,056 --> 00:35:18,432
<b>I say that</b>

510
00:35:19,308 --> 00:35:21,769
<b>because I've only seen you

511
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,397
<b>Anyway, thank you for everything.</b>

512

<b>Ms. Jung and I...</b>

513
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:36,033
<b>I mean, we always fill in

514
00:35:37,243 --> 00:35:40,371
<b>so I'll accept this on her behalf.</b>

515
00:35:41,581 --> 00:35:42,748
<b>Is that so?</b>

516
00:35:43,457 --> 00:35:47,211
<b>Well, it's different
from an attorney-client relationship.</b>

517
00:35:47,295 --> 00:35:49,839
<b>What we have is quite special.
Shall I say we desire...</b>

518
00:35:49,922 --> 00:35:51,257
<b>Hello, Ms. Jung.</b>

519
00:35:52,466 --> 00:35:53,467
<b>Tonight?</b>

00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,803
<b>Yes, I'm free tonight.</b>

521
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:58,431
<b>Yes.</b>

522
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:02,018
<b>I'll make a reservation.</b>

523
00:36:09,025 --> 00:36:09,942
<b>Congratulations.</b>

524
00:36:10,651 --> 00:36:13,654
<b>You hit a home run

525
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:15,072
<b>-You're amazing.
-Congratulations.</b>

526
00:36:18,784 --> 00:36:21,245
<b>So what's up?
Congratulating me must be just an excuse.</b>

527
00:36:21,329 --> 00:36:23,372
<b>Don't you have something to say?</b>

528
00:36:25,249 --> 00:36:26,375
<b>Well...</b>

00:36:26,459 --> 00:36:28,210
<b>Nothing's up, but...</b>

530
00:36:32,214 --> 00:36:34,091
<b>We think there's something going on</b>

<b>between Ms. Jung and Mr. Yoon.</b>

<b>-What exactly is going on?
-Pardon?</b>

533
00:36:43,893 --> 00:36:45,061
<b>The thing is...</b>

534
00:36:45,353 --> 00:36:47,772
<b>Take the Issume Case for example.</b>

535
00:36:47,855 --> 00:36:51,776
<b>We have reasons to believe
that Ha Chan-ho's medical records,</b>

536
00:36:51,859 --> 00:36:55,738
<b>which were considered top secret,
ended up in her hands.</b>

537
00:36:57,239 --> 00:36:58,157
<b>So?</b>

538
00:36:58,783 --> 00:37:02,536
<b>Are you saying Yoon Hee-jae leaked
that confidential information to her?</b>

539
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:06,540
<b>Or are you speculating it
because they're close?</b>

540
00:37:07,124 --> 00:37:08,626
<b>-That's right.
-Yes.</b>

541
00:37:09,251 --> 00:37:11,796
<b>Mr. Ma, you're telling me this</b>

542
00:37:11,879 --> 00:37:14,423
<b>just after Ms. Jung successfully closed
an important deal.</b>

543
00:37:14,507 --> 00:37:17,468
<b>Don't you think I might get the wrong idea

544
00:37:19,553 --> 00:37:20,513
<b>Let's drop this.</b>

545

<b>Yes, ma'am.</b>

<b>Did we perhaps choose a rotten rope?</b>

549
00:37:55,548 --> 00:37:56,424
<b>What?</b>

550
00:37:57,258 --> 00:37:58,134
<b>A rope?</b>

551
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:02,638
<b>Do you think I'm someone

<b>Mr. Ma.</b>

555
00:38:25,453 --> 00:38:27,955
<b>Gnosis' market value will surpass
100 billion won.</b>

556
00:38:29,248 --> 00:38:33,044
<b>With strategic manipulation,
it'll go up exponentially from there.</b>

557
00:38:35,463 --> 00:38:36,839
<b>Not bad, right?</b>

558
00:38:38,924 --> 00:38:41,677
<b>Song & Kim will get 20 percent

560
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:48,601
<b>What do you say? Are you happy with that?</b>

561
00:38:51,479 --> 00:38:53,022
<b>There's something Guus Hiddink said.</b>

562

<b>"I'm still hungry."</b>

563
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:06,035
<b>Thank you for everything.</b>

<b>To tell you the truth,

<b>can we talk about

<b>You're really something.</b>
