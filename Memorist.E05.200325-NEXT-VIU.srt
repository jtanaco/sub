00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,414
<b>A kid just collapsed. Hurry!</b>

159
00:12:11,699 --> 00:12:13,235
<b>Metro isn't saying much.</b>

160
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,969
<b>They already took photos.</b>

161
00:12:14,969 --> 00:12:16,205
<b>Of course they're not interested.</b>

162
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,544
<b>Only I know this face and composition.</b>

163
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:21,914
<b>So where exactly did you see this?</b>

164
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,215
<b>I'll tell you when it's time.</b>

165
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:25,855
<b>And when will that be?</b>

166
00:12:26,939 --> 00:12:28,550
<b>Always so cryptic.</b>

167
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,485
<b>It was dropped off two days ago.</b>

168
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,625
<b>I doubt you deal with paintings like this here.</b>

169
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:38,095
<b>It's why I was going to send it back immediately,</b>

170
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:40,119
<b>but there wasn't a contact number.</b>

171
00:12:40,119 --> 00:12:41,260
<b>Nothing?</b>

172
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,865
<b>There was no waybill either.</b>

173
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:45,404
<b>Any small detail at this point would help.</b>

174
00:12:45,729 --> 00:12:47,335
<b>It wasn't anything weird,</b>

175
00:12:48,069 --> 00:12:50,674
<b>but Mr. Park seemed highly satisfied with it.</b>

176
00:12:55,239 --> 00:12:56,644
<b>He must've been satisfied with it,</b>

177
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,514
<b>considering how he looked at it for hours.</b>

178
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,924
<b>Shouldn't this be an insult to him?</b>

179
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:05,150
<b>Exactly. How weird.</b>

180
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,325
<b>Hold on.</b>

181
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,225
<b>What is it?</b>

182
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:13,434
<b>Wait a second. This seems off.</b>

183
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:15,005
<b>What does?</b>

184
00:13:15,229 --> 00:13:16,664
<b>That wasn't it.</b>

185
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:20,975
<b>When I unwrapped it,</b>

186
00:13:23,829 --> 00:13:25,444
<b>I saw a blade.</b>

187
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:27,944
<b>A long blade.</b>

188
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:29,784
<b>What on earth?</b>

189
00:13:35,979 --> 00:13:37,184
<b>There was another layer.</b>

190
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:39,225
<b>Another layer?</b>

191
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,294
<b>The killer peeled it off.</b>

192
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:54,868
<b>He was found at a way station at the age of seven.</b>

193
00:13:54,869 --> 00:13:56,745
<b>He wouldn't speak let alone say his name,</b>

194
00:13:56,829 --> 00:13:58,239
<b>so he bounced from facilities for the disabled...</b>

195
00:13:58,239 --> 00:13:59,674
<b>before landing in an orphanage.</b>

196
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,439
<b>He was named after Dongbaek Station where he was found.</b>

197
00:14:02,439 --> 00:14:04,284
<b>Nothing worth noticing happened while growing up.</b>

198
00:14:04,369 --> 00:14:06,755
<b>He revealed his abilities at the age of 20,</b>

199
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:10,380
<b>was offered countless jobs, but he chose to become a cop.</b>

200
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,755
<b>- Why? - There's an interview.</b>

201
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:18,794
<b>The justice system is the best way to catch the bad guys, right?</b>

202
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:20,965
<b>What a nutjob.</b>

203
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:26,575
<b>He turned down millions of dollars for 2,000 dollars a month.</b>

204
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,144
<b>That includes research funding from global companies.</b>

205
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:31,745
<b>What could it be?</b>

206
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:35,414
<b>Why did he choose the most illogical career path?</b>

207
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:38,284
<b>No one remembers him from his childhood days...</b>

208
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:40,985
<b>even though he's now an international celebrity.</b>

209
00:14:41,949 --> 00:14:43,424
<b>I have the alibi video.</b>

210
00:14:46,479 --> 00:14:49,264
<b>The news team had him under surveillance.</b>

211
00:14:53,089 --> 00:14:54,534
<b>He peeled off the top layer.</b>

212
00:14:55,189 --> 00:14:57,564
<b>So the one who sent this must be the perp.</b>

213
00:14:58,089 --> 00:15:00,034
<b>Why though?</b>

214
00:15:00,229 --> 00:15:02,069
<b>Why risk getting caught?</b>

215
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:04,505
<b>- The perp was challenging him. - What?</b>

216
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,040
<b>It wasn't delivered by a company truck,</b>

217
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,745
<b>so it'll take time to track down.</b>

218
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,784
<b>There aren't CCTV cameras in the area either.</b>

219
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:12,615
<b>- Where's that guy? - I'll bring him back.</b>

220
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:14,014
<b>What do you think you're doing?</b>

221
00:15:14,739 --> 00:15:16,109
<b>You said you were done processing this place.</b>

222
00:15:16,109 --> 00:15:17,209
<b>Hello, ma'am.</b>

223
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:18,819
<b>I already spoke to your husband.</b>

224
00:15:18,819 --> 00:15:21,524
<b>Mr. Park is in this mess because of you people.</b>

225
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:24,164
<b>- Leave. Get out! - What?</b>

226
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:26,294
<b>- Leave! - Sure, we're leaving.</b>

227
00:15:26,319 --> 00:15:27,534
<b>Let's go.</b>

228
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:31,064
<b>The devil's spawns.</b>

229
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:35,674
<b>Unbelievable. Her faith is still intact.</b>

230
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,075
<b>Have Forensics confiscate the painting.</b>

231
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,339
<b>What about the delivery truck?</b>

232
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:40,715
<b>I need manpower to track it down.</b>

233
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,115
<b>Why don't we let Metro take the case?</b>

234
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:45,654
<b>We'll be shoved aside since it's not in our jurisdiction anyway.</b>

235
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,115
<b>I saw it.</b>

236
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:52,294
<b>I saw the delivery truck.</b>

237
00:15:56,319 --> 00:15:58,125
<b>Did you really see the delivery truck?</b>

238
00:15:59,089 --> 00:16:00,294
<b>How about the license plate?</b>

239
00:16:00,589 --> 00:16:02,105
<b>That I don't remember,</b>

240
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:05,630
<b>but a phone number in huge letters was written on the side.</b>

241
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:07,135
<b>- Really? - Really?</b>

242
00:16:07,459 --> 00:16:08,644
<b>And the numbers?</b>

243
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:11,144
<b>How should I know? I wouldn't have memorized it.</b>

244
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,044
<b>What? Then what is it that you know?</b>

245
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:16,215
<b>You can do your thing.</b>

246
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,215
<b>The memory scan.</b>

247
00:16:18,939 --> 00:16:20,814
<b>You shouldn't mess with grown-ups.</b>

248
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,424
<b>No, I'll do it.</b>

249
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,779
<b>On one condition.</b>

250
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:28,024
<b>- On one condition? - I want your phone number.</b>

251
00:16:28,619 --> 00:16:31,394
<b>- Sure thing. 010... - She was asking for mine.</b>

252
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,294
<b>No, yours.</b>

253
00:16:34,489 --> 00:16:37,034
<b>Who else would I want to contact?</b>

254
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:38,404
<b>What?</b>

255
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,875
<b>- Mind your business, old man. - Old man?</b>

256
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:44,530
<b>I'm two years younger than he is.</b>

257
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:46,914
<b>- You see... - Is that all you want?</b>

258
00:16:47,739 --> 00:16:50,014
<b>- I'll take it the way I want. - The way you want?</b>

259
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:58,995
<b>Nothing's out of the ordinary.</b>

260
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:05,335
<b>Hold it. Check that light.</b>

261
00:17:13,129 --> 00:17:14,875
<b>A motion sensor light in the stairway?</b>

262
00:17:14,899 --> 00:17:17,399
<b>The one downstairs didn't turn on. Maybe it malfunctioned.</b>

263
00:17:17,399 --> 00:17:19,815
<b>How many times did the lights in the 3rd and 4th floor go on?</b>

264
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,714
<b>Let me check. Twice.</b>

265
00:17:23,369 --> 00:17:25,615
<b>Once at midnight and once at 4am.</b>

266
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:28,885
<b>Four hours from his house and back.</b>

267
00:17:29,179 --> 00:17:30,355
<b>The rooftop.</b>

268
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,954
<b>Rooftop?</b>

269
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:36,694
<b>That's how he got out.</b>

270
00:17:46,359 --> 00:17:47,575
<b>Here.</b>

271
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,454
<b>Don't be too late.</b>

272
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,994
<b>(Daeguk Deliveries)</b>

273
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:48,805
<b>Okay.</b>

274
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:54,635
<b>He could've gone anywhere without being caught on camera.</b>

275
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:57,775
<b>That's only if he could jump across that.</b>

276
00:18:57,829 --> 00:19:00,615
<b>Ma'am. I really can't stand Dong Baek,</b>

277
00:19:00,669 --> 00:19:01,944
<b>but this isn't right.</b>

278
00:19:02,109 --> 00:19:03,809
<b>He jumped that in the middle of the night?</b>

279
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,785
<b>He'd die if he missed even slightly.</b>

280
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:08,240
<b>He despises murder.</b>

281
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,020
<b>I heard Occam's Razor is about eliminating complicated theories.</b>

282
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,224
<b>But this is so complicated, that I can't even imagine it.</b>

283
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:17,394
<b>These are the theories that we should eliminate first.</b>

284
00:19:17,649 --> 00:19:18,795
<b>That's right.</b>

285
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,635
<b>Over there.</b>

286
00:19:20,919 --> 00:19:23,704
<b>Hi. I have the blood test results of the witnesses.</b>

287
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,075
<b>A sleeping gas was detected in small amounts.</b>

288
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:29,099
<b>If they fainted due to the gas...</b>

289
00:19:29,099 --> 00:19:31,375
<b>It wasn't the use of supernatural powers.</b>

290
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,668
<b>Then is Dong Baek removed from the list of suspects?</b>

291
00:19:35,669 --> 00:19:38,714
<b>Hey. Why are you so happy? Aren't you enemies?</b>

292
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:41,385
<b>I wasn't happy.</b>

293
00:19:41,879 --> 00:19:43,585
<b>We'll keep the option open that supernatural powers were used.</b>

294
00:19:44,409 --> 00:19:45,595
<b>- What? - What?</b>

295
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:46,848
<b>Question the people in the area.</b>

296
00:19:46,849 --> 00:19:47,954
<b>Yes, ma'am.</b>

297
00:19:56,089 --> 00:19:57,990
<b>Based on the MRI,</b>

298
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:00,704
<b>we do not see any special abnormalities.</b>

299
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,329
<b>In order to determine the cause of the fainting...</b>

300
00:20:03,329 --> 00:20:05,515
<b>Superintendent Han Sun Mi needs to talk to you.</b>

301
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:07,815
<b>The patient will not cooperate.</b>

302
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,444
<b>Other vitals and body index are stable.</b>

303
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:15,424
<b>I plan to suggest a more detailed CT scan of the brain.</b>

304
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:19,224
<b>I thought we were done when we spoke on the phone.</b>

305
00:20:20,379 --> 00:20:21,555
<b>I wanted to meet you.</b>

306
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,525
<b>I had to come anyway on another matter.</b>

307
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:27,595
<b>Superintendent Han Sun Mi. Do you know how many doctors...</b>

308
00:20:28,389 --> 00:20:30,065
<b>have been treating Dong Baek?</b>

309
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:34,335
<b>- I don't know. - 12 department chiefs.</b>

310
00:20:35,099 --> 00:20:37,075
<b>- That's a lot. - The department of neurology alone.</b>

311
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,770
<b>There are 40 if you include other departments.</b>

312
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:41,869
<b>If you include the staff, add another zero.</b>

00:57:42,389 --> 00:57:43,734
<b>It's a corpse.</b>

781
00:57:57,708 --> 00:57:59,079
<b>Angel of the Lord</b>

782
00:57:59,079 --> 00:58:00,353
<b>My guardian dear</b>

783
00:58:03,349 --> 00:58:04,924
<b>To whom</b>

784
00:58:05,019 --> 00:58:07,294
<b>- His love commits me here - To whom His love commits me here</b>

785
00:58:07,989 --> 00:58:10,864
<b>Ever this day be at my side</b>

786
00:58:10,889 --> 00:58:13,019
<b>To light and guard</b>

787
00:58:13,019 --> 00:58:15,433
<b>- To rule and guide - To rule and guide</b>

788
00:58:15,829 --> 00:58:17,904
<b>- Amen. - Amen.</b>

789
00:58:18,358 --> 00:58:19,573
<b>Amen!</b>

790
00:58:54,429 --> 00:58:57,498
<b>(Memorist)</b>

791
00:58:57,498 --> 00:59:00,139
<b>Do you know the juvenile double jeopardy case?</b>

792
00:59:00,139 --> 00:59:02,769
<b>Six years ago, a little girl who was an orphan died.</b>

793
00:59:02,769 --> 00:59:04,913
<b>And the culprits turned out to be middle school girls.</b>

794
00:59:04,978 --> 00:59:06,254
<b>An execution-style murder.</b>

795
00:59:06,539 --> 00:59:09,553
<b>Punishing evil by becoming evil themselves.</b>

796
00:59:09,679 --> 00:59:11,353
<b>The exact same thing is happening again.</b>

797
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:13,353
<b>It's just like what happened 20 years ago.</b>

798
00:59:13,378 --> 00:59:15,694
<b>The special team has no records of it at all?</b>

799
00:59:15,889 --> 00:59:17,064
<b>The person in charge of the investigation...</b>

800
00:59:18,019 --> 00:59:19,719
<b>- What? - It's someone close by.</b>

801
00:59:19,719 --> 00:59:20,858
<b>Someone who's high up.</b>

802
00:59:20,858 --> 00:59:21,964
<b>That's pretty close by.</b>

803
00:59:22,389 --> 00:59:23,504
<b>It's him.</b>
