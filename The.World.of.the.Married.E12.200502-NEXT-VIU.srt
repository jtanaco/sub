<b>So please tell us where you were that night.</b>

33

<b>You need to tell us, sir.</b>

34

<b>If you stay quiet, it might get you in trouble.</b>

35
00:03:08,941 --> 00:03:10,811
<b>Why isn't he saying anything?</b>

36
00:03:11,011 --> 00:03:12,610
<b>Do you think he really did something?</b>

37
00:03:12,951 --> 00:03:14,420
<b>I'm also getting suspicious.</b>

38
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,381
<b>He needs to talk in order for us to know.</b>

39
00:03:55,561 --> 00:03:57,191
<b>What... What brings you here?</b>

40
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,191
<b>You didn't need to come here for questioning.</b>

41

<b>Ms. Min Hyun Seo already told us...</b>

<b>that she dropped your scarf at the station.</b>

43
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:10,941
<b>I'm here for Mr. Lee Tae Oh.</b>

44
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,201
<b>That day,</b>

45
00:04:39,501 --> 00:04:41,600
<b>when Park In Kyu died,</b>

46
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,181
<b>he was with me.</b>

47
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,261
<b>Mr. Lee and I...</b>

48
00:05:04,561 --> 00:05:05,890
<b>were together.</b>

49
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:09,501
<b>We were together in my car at the parking lot.</b>

50
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,400
<b>That's not what Ms. Min said.</b>

51
00:05:22,241 --> 00:05:23,280
<b>That's not true.</b>

52
00:05:24,451 --> 00:05:27,410
<b>Mr. Lee was with me by the emergency exit.</b>

53
00:05:28,251 --> 00:05:30,991
<b>In Kyu fell from the rooftop after he went up there.</b>

54
00:05:30,991 --> 00:05:34,660
<b>You say he went up there, but that's just your opinion.</b>

55
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:37,160
<b>An assumption or opinion...</b>

56
00:05:37,761 --> 00:05:39,790
<b>isn't enough to make someone a murderer.</b>

57
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,761
<b>Right, detective?</b>

58
00:05:44,631 --> 00:05:46,230
<b>Yes, of course.</b>

59
00:05:46,371 --> 00:05:50,040
<b>But since there's a witness, it's inevitable for us...</b>

60
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,741
<b>to investigate what happened.</b>

61
00:05:55,381 --> 00:05:57,780
<b>He was with me at that hour.</b>

62
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:00,811
<b>Do you have proof?</b>

63
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,431
<b>It's his wedding ring.</b>

64
00:06:15,701 --> 00:06:17,431
<b>I found it in my car.</b>

65
00:06:25,311 --> 00:06:26,371
<b>I'm...</b>

66
00:06:28,311 --> 00:06:29,840
<b>his alibi.</b>

67
00:06:36,951 --> 00:06:38,020
<b>Is that good enough?</b>

68
00:06:45,691 --> 00:06:46,730
<b>The ring?</b>

69
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,330
<b>Why do you ask?</b>

70
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,571
<b>I can't tell you anything in detail because it's an investigation.</b>

71
00:06:56,701 --> 00:07:00,111
<b>If you want to help your husband, just give me an honest answer.</b>

72
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:03,011
<b>When did you notice...</b>

73
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:06,311
<b>that your husband wasn't wearing his wedding ring?</b>

74
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,090
<b>It was missing ever since that night.</b>

75
00:07:12,991 --> 00:07:14,460
<b>And I also don't know where it is.</b>

76
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,631
<b>Okay, thank you for your cooperation.</b>

77

<b>(Episode 12)</b>

78
00:07:56,701 --> 00:07:58,071
<b>Let's talk.</b>

79
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,640
<b>I met with Chairman Yeo before coming here.</b>

80
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:07,941
<b>Was that...</b>

81
00:08:10,811 --> 00:08:13,011
<b>all you were in that family?</b>

82
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,530
<b>Did you dump Joon Young and me...</b>

83
00:08:28,301 --> 00:08:30,201
<b>to be treated like that?</b>

84
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,100
<b>You said you'd take care of it. Why must I get a call like that?</b>

85
00:09:13,411 --> 00:09:15,240
<b>You won't get a call like that again.</b>

86
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,411
<b>Did you...</b>

87
00:09:19,811 --> 00:09:20,911
<b>clear your name?</b>

88
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:28,590
<b>Yes. Thanks to Sun Woo.</b>

89
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:33,130
<b>What?</b>

90
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:35,860
<b>Isn't it funny?</b>

91
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,500
<b>Right? Doesn't this totally stink?</b>

92
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,901
<b>The person who came to save me...</b>

93
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:44,740
<b>was none other than Sun Woo.</b>

94
00:09:46,141 --> 00:09:48,840
<b>- You said she may have killed him. - I know.</b>

95
00:09:50,641 --> 00:09:52,510
<b>She could've been suspected instead,</b>

96
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:57,220
<b>but she took on that risk in that situation to come.</b>

97
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,551
<b>Why? What for?</b>

98
00:10:00,451 --> 00:10:02,321
<b>Does she still have feelings for you?</b>

99
00:10:02,321 --> 00:10:03,661
<b>Because of Joon Young!</b>

100
00:10:04,661 --> 00:10:06,561
<b>Because I'm Joon Young's dad!</b>

101
00:10:13,531 --> 00:10:14,701
<b>But Da Kyung.</b>

102
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:19,740
<b>I'm...</b>

103
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,210
<b>also Jenny's dad.</b>

104
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:29,880
<b>Am I wrong?</b>

105
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:49,500
<b>How great would it be if you could get over someone that easily?</b>

106
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:54,230
<b>You'd better brace yourself.</b>

107
00:11:55,141 --> 00:11:57,500
<b>Ending your relationship won't be as easy as you think.</b>

108
00:11:58,411 --> 00:11:59,610
<b>At least that's how it was with me.</b>

109
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:22,730
<b>Did you sleep well?</b>

110
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,051
<b>What's wrong? Do you not have an appetite?</b>

111
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:44,421
<b>Give me a minute. I'll make you some toast.</b>

112
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:46,151
<b>Don't bother.</b>

113
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:51,730
<b>It'll be a minute.</b>

114
00:12:52,561 --> 00:12:53,661
<b>I said not to bother.</b>

115
00:12:58,571 --> 00:12:59,901
<b>Park In Kyu?</b>

116
00:13:00,701 --> 00:13:02,701
<b>It was determined to be suicide and the case was closed.</b>

117
00:13:03,701 --> 00:13:04,870
<b>It was suicide?</b>

118
00:13:06,441 --> 00:13:08,941
<b>The autopsy supported it, and given the circumstances,</b>

119
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,850
<b>his family hasn't protested,</b>

120
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:13,710
<b>so I think that's how it'll end.</b>

121
00:13:14,411 --> 00:13:15,551
<b>I see.</b>

122
00:13:16,181 --> 00:13:19,250
<b>I'm sure you were very worried, but there's no need.</b>

123
00:13:19,421 --> 00:13:21,620
<b>Our apologies for causing a disturbance.</b>

124
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,350
<b>Why did you do it?</b>

125
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,051
<b>I said to trust me.</b>

126
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:26,051
<b>I told you.</b>

127
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:30,561
<b>I didn't want to hurt you.</b>

128
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:33,130
<b>I was making sure no one would get hurt.</b>

129
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:35,960
<b>If you hadn't stepped in,</b>

130
00:14:37,301 --> 00:14:39,171
<b>it would've ended more simply.</b>

131
00:14:43,171 --> 00:14:44,771
<b>So was the conclusion...</b>

132
00:14:48,281 --> 00:14:49,510
<b>suicide?</b>

133
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:53,250
<b>That In Kyu died...</b>

134
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,781
<b>because of me, because I broke up with him.</b>

135
00:14:58,391 --> 00:15:00,191
<b>Don't feel guilty.</b>

136
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:02,061
<b>He chose that route himself.</b>

137
00:15:03,421 --> 00:15:04,891
<b>It's over now.</b>

138
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,630
<b>Okay?</b>

139
00:15:20,141 --> 00:15:21,411
<b>It's over for me,</b>

140
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,880
<b>but what about you?</b>

141
00:15:27,281 --> 00:15:29,181
<b>What will you do now?</b>

142
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,380
<b>You should...</b>

143
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:36,090
<b>worry about your own future.</b>

144
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:40,661
<b>Do you know why I couldn't free myself from In Kyu?</b>

145
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,661
<b>Because I pitied him.</b>

146
00:15:44,431 --> 00:15:46,701
<b>He was a despicable human being,</b>

147
00:15:48,401 --> 00:15:50,941
<b>but I couldn't dump him because I pitied him.</b>

148
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:53,970
<b>That's how I ended up here.</b>

149
00:15:57,181 --> 00:15:59,411
<b>But that's what I saw in your eyes last night.</b>

150
00:16:01,551 --> 00:16:03,321
<b>You knew it was wrong.</b>

151
00:16:04,521 --> 00:16:07,321
<b>Just as I covered for that jerk and protected him,</b>

152
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:11,090
<b>that's what you were doing...</b>

153
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:13,630
<b>to Lee Tae Oh.</b>

154
00:16:17,561 --> 00:16:18,730
<b>Be careful.</b>

155
00:16:20,431 --> 00:16:22,671
<b>There's no guarantee that you won't end up...</b>

156
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:27,071
<b>like me.</b>

157
00:17:08,451 --> 00:17:10,280
<b>Is it over already? This easily?</b>

158
00:17:11,851 --> 00:17:13,121
<b>Depends on your point of view.</b>

159
00:17:16,191 --> 00:17:19,530
<b>I'm sure the police investigated thoroughly, right?</b>

160
00:17:24,661 --> 00:17:27,300
<b>I couldn't let Joon Young be a murderer's son.</b>

161
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:30,841
<b>Plus, Tae Oh wouldn't do that.</b>

162
00:17:35,681 --> 00:17:37,681
<b>I'm a selfish human being too.</b>

163
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,510
<b>Depends on your point of view.</b>

164
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,331
<b>Be careful of Chairman Yeo.</b>

165
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:55,861
<b>He'll only look at things the way he wants to see them.</b>

166
00:18:09,181 --> 00:18:11,951
<b>I'm sorry I worried you with a disgraceful problem.</b>

167
00:18:12,081 --> 00:18:13,750
<b>If I want to get a good shot,</b>

168
00:18:14,611 --> 00:18:16,820
<b>I need to get distracting thoughts out of my mind.</b>

169
00:18:17,851 --> 00:18:19,891
<b>But, such thoughts are impossible to get rid of.</b>

170
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,861
<b>I just have to control them.</b>

171
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,431
<b>So, what are your future plans?</b>

172
00:18:27,331 --> 00:18:28,760
<b>There's an investor...</b>

173
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,401
<b>who's interested in the script I'm working on right now.</b>

174
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,030
<b>- We're having meetings. - What about Ji Sun Woo?</b>

175
00:18:36,401 --> 00:18:37,871
<b>I thought you said...</b>

176
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:40,740
<b>you'll make sure to get rid of her.</b>

177
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,810
<b>Are you just going to let things be the way they are?</b>

178
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:47,611
<b>Whether she lives in Gosan or not, I intend on not running into her.</b>

179
00:18:48,421 --> 00:18:50,151
<b>Every time I run into her,</b>

180
00:18:50,151 --> 00:18:52,720
<b>Da Kyung and I get into unnecessary misunderstandings.</b>

181
00:18:53,691 --> 00:18:55,520
<b>Are you saying you'll make Da Kyung an excuse...</b>

182
00:18:57,621 --> 00:19:00,260
<b>to keep Ji Sun Woo by your side?</b>

183
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:07,201
<b>I did all kinds of things while trying to make her leave,</b>

184
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:09,101
<b>and I was wrongfully accused of murder.</b>

185
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:11,740
<b>How much more do I have to do before you trust me?</b>

186
00:19:14,441 --> 00:19:18,240
<b>Park In Kyu fell at 23:12:45.</b>

187
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:22,881
<b>If you look at the time below this footage...</b>

188
00:19:28,421 --> 00:19:30,191
<b>The time Mr. Lee went up the emergency stairwell...</b>

189
00:19:30,191 --> 00:19:32,560
<b>was 23:13:38.</b>

190
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:36,631
<b>According to these times, it was after Park In Kyu fell.</b>

191
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:45,310
<b>Do you have time on the weekend?</b>

192
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:47,671
<b>Let's play a round of golf with Da Kyung.</b>

193
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,111
<b>I'm sorry, sir.</b>

194
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:55,220
<b>I don't think I'll have the time.</b>

195
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,260
<b>My mom says...</b>

196
00:20:10,701 --> 00:20:13,070
<b>that man died because Joon Young's mom dumped him.</b>

197
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:14,331
<b>Was he really her boyfriend?</b>

198
00:20:14,931 --> 00:20:15,970
<b>That's crazy.</b>

199
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:17,641
<b>No way. Who'd commit suicide for being dumped?</b>

200
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,240
<b>I can't understand it.</b>

201
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,641
<b>- Was it really suicide, though? - Hey.</b>

202
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,050
<b>What?</b>

203
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,621
<b>It sounds like you're talking about my mom.</b>

204
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:39,191
<b>- So what? - I'm curious.</b>

205
00:20:40,161 --> 00:20:42,431
<b>I'd like you to say it to me if it's about my mom.</b>

206
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:45,601
<b>Forget it. Darn it.</b>

207
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:49,770
<b>I said, tell me. I couldn't hear you properly.</b>

208
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,740
<b>Hey, why do you want me to tell you?</b>

209
00:20:53,941 --> 00:20:55,381
<b>Didn't you see the news?</b>

210
00:20:55,381 --> 00:20:58,611
<b>What you talked about wasn't on the news.</b>

211
00:20:58,611 --> 00:21:00,851
<b>He jumped to his death because he was dumped by his girlfriend.</b>

212
00:21:00,851 --> 00:21:02,351
<b>That girlfriend was your mom.</b>

213
00:21:02,351 --> 00:21:04,480
<b>- Who says? - My mom.</b>

214
00:21:04,921 --> 00:21:06,351
<b>Everyone in the neighborhood knows this too.</b>

215
00:21:06,351 --> 00:21:07,990
<b>He was my mom's patient.</b>

216
00:21:08,391 --> 00:21:11,320
<b>She shouldn't gossip if she doesn't know anything.</b>

217
00:21:11,621 --> 00:21:13,331
<b>- What did you say, jerk? - Your mom...</b>

218
00:21:13,331 --> 00:21:15,131
<b>is an expert at gossiping.</b>

219
00:21:15,131 --> 00:21:17,460
<b>- She makes up lies all the time. - Do you want to die?</b>

220
00:21:18,831 --> 00:21:20,070
<b>Go ahead and hit me.</b>

221
00:21:20,671 --> 00:21:22,401
<b>What is it? Are you scared?</b>

222
00:21:23,941 --> 00:21:25,111
<b>I said, hit me.</b>

223
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:30,810
<b>What are you doing? Let go of each other!</b>

224
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,581
<b>Darn it.</b>

225
00:22:04,911 --> 00:22:06,250
<b>Why are you home?</b>

226
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:09,421
<b>Didn't you go to the academy?</b>

227
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,451
<b>Are you feeling sick?</b>

228
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,960
<b>What happened?</b>

229
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,260
<b>I won't know unless you tell me.</b>

230
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:19,960
<b>Can't I miss a day?</b>

231
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,300
<b>Do I need to have a reason?</b>

232
00:22:26,171 --> 00:22:27,730
<b>Will just a day be enough?</b>

233
00:22:28,331 --> 00:22:30,141
<b>Will you be okay tomorrow?</b>

234
00:22:32,411 --> 00:22:34,111
<b>How long are you going to be like this?</b>

235
00:22:34,111 --> 00:22:36,540
<b>I don't know. Just leave me alone, okay?</b>

236
00:22:51,191 --> 00:22:52,230
<b>Here.</b>

237
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,530
<b>I told you not to be so sluggish.</b>

238
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,871
<b>I moved fast today.</b>

239
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:03,341
<b>It's late. You should go.</b>

240
00:23:03,701 --> 00:23:05,171
<b>Make sure to eat dinner.</b>

241
00:23:05,671 --> 00:23:08,210
<b>I will. See you at home later.</b>

242
00:23:08,881 --> 00:23:10,510
<b>Be careful on your way.</b>

243
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,250
<b>Mi Yun.</b>

244
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:15,720
<b>- Long time no see. - Ma'am.</b>

245
00:23:16,181 --> 00:23:18,451
<b>- Have you been well? - Yes.</b>

246
00:23:19,921 --> 00:23:21,191
<b>No Eul, are you going home?</b>

247
00:23:22,661 --> 00:23:23,691
<b>Yes.</b>

248
00:23:23,691 --> 00:23:26,091
<b>Good timing. I'm about to go too.</b>

249
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:29,401
<b>I'll drive her home. Is that okay with you?</b>

250
00:23:29,401 --> 00:23:32,000
<b>No, you don't have to do that.</b>

251
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:34,831
<b>It's on the way anyway.</b>

252
00:23:35,871 --> 00:23:37,141
<b>Are you okay with it, No Eul?</b>

253
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,111
<b>Yes.</b>

254
00:23:53,921 --> 00:23:55,520
<b>Thank you for giving me a ride.</b>

255
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,960
<b>You're good to your mom, so I wanted to drive you as a treat.</b>

256
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:03,060
<b>All we have are each other.</b>

257
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,601
<b>I wish Joon Young...</b>

258
00:24:07,601 --> 00:24:10,740
<b>would get along with me like you do with your mom.</b>

259
00:24:11,941 --> 00:24:15,411
<b>I think he's disappointed in me. He never talks to me.</b>

260
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:20,681
<b>How is he at school?</b>

261
00:24:21,081 --> 00:24:22,381
<b>Is he doing okay?</b>

262
00:24:25,081 --> 00:24:29,060
<b>He was being pettish today and didn't even go to his academy.</b>

263
00:24:29,861 --> 00:24:32,361
<b>I wish I knew what happened so I can make him feel better,</b>

264
00:24:34,191 --> 00:24:36,500
<b>but he never says anything so I have no idea.</b>

265
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:41,101
<b>You don't want to talk, do you?</b>

266
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:48,881
<b>Guys can be childish.</b>

267
00:24:49,911 --> 00:24:52,181
<b>The other boys kept on saying ridiculous things.</b>

268
00:24:53,081 --> 00:24:54,181
<b>Like what?</b>

269
00:24:56,951 --> 00:24:59,151
<b>They were saying that the man...</b>

270
00:25:00,691 --> 00:25:04,320
<b>who died at Gosan Station was your boyfriend.</b>

271
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,530
<b>Who said that?</b>

272
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:34,790
<b>Pull.</b>

273
00:25:44,931 --> 00:25:46,470
<b>Gosh, Associate Director Ji.</b>

274
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:50,570
<b>Right, you're not the associate director anymore.</b>

275
00:25:51,601 --> 00:25:54,171
<b>What is it? You never call me.</b>

276
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:56,111
<b>I was a little surprised.</b>

277
00:25:59,151 --> 00:26:00,780
<b>Are you that curious about my boyfriend?</b>

278
00:26:04,851 --> 00:26:07,790
<b>Why would you talk such nonsense in front of a child?</b>

279
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:10,560
<b>It's not like you saw me with my boyfriend.</b>

280
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,861
<b>What's wrong? Have you gone crazy?</b>

281
00:26:15,931 --> 00:26:17,901
<b>You should watch who you're dealing with.</b>

282
00:26:19,131 --> 00:26:21,800
<b>Your husband wants to become a politician, right?</b>

283
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:24,201
<b>Should I sue you for defamation and contempt?</b>

284
00:26:24,201 --> 00:26:27,341
<b>Or, should I start a dirty scandal?</b>

285
00:26:28,611 --> 00:26:32,181
<b>I know countless ways to ruin your husband's future...</b>

286
00:26:32,181 --> 00:26:33,581
<b>in a single strike.</b>

287
00:26:34,151 --> 00:26:36,550
<b>How does that sound? It sounds fun, doesn't it?</b>

288
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,760
<b>If you ever let Joon Young hear something ridiculous again,</b>

289
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,661
<b>I'll crush...</b>

290
00:26:46,861 --> 00:26:48,591
<b>you and your husband.</b>

291
00:27:28,201 --> 00:27:30,240
<b>Did you decide to keep it off now?</b>

292
00:27:33,911 --> 00:27:34,941
<b>Tae Oh.</b>

293
00:27:37,641 --> 00:27:38,740
<b>Honey.</b>

294
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,701
<b>Okay, just a second.</b>

295
00:28:39,141 --> 00:28:41,040
<b>- These are for you. - Thank you.</b>

296
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,111
<b>Goodbye.</b>

297
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:19,911
<b>(Wifey)</b>

298
00:29:24,921 --> 00:29:27,020
<b>Will you please take your stuff?</b>

299
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,901
<b>Thank you.</b>

300
00:29:37,861 --> 00:29:40,230
<b>Hey, wait. Let me go inside.</b>

301
00:29:44,641 --> 00:29:45,911
<b>Hey, nice timing.</b>

302
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:47,411
<b>I'm hungry, too.</b>

303
00:29:47,611 --> 00:29:48,941
<b>Did you know I'd be here?</b>

304
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,881
<b>You should've ordered some beer as well.</b>

305
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,691
<b>Shouldn't you be at work?</b>

306
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:21,310
<b>If you don't take your stuff today, I'll just throw them out.</b>

307
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:22,881
<b>So keep that in mind.</b>

308
00:30:34,191 --> 00:30:35,250
<b>Ye Rim.</b>

309
00:30:36,361 --> 00:30:37,861
<b>Are you depressed?</b>

310
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:40,230
<b>No, I'm taking a break.</b>

311
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:43,101
<b>Do you always order food like this?</b>

312
00:30:43,101 --> 00:30:45,101
<b>What do you care?</b>

313
00:30:45,101 --> 00:30:46,331
<b>Do you sleep well?</b>

314
00:30:46,331 --> 00:30:48,000
<b>Why don't we both go to the hospital...</b>

315
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,701
<b>and meet Dr. Kim for counseling?</b>

316
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,310
<b>Stop talking nonsense.</b>

317
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:56,181
<b>Just take your stuff and go home.</b>

318
00:30:58,181 --> 00:31:00,310
<b>Why are you suddenly nagging at me?</b>

319
00:31:20,831 --> 00:31:22,101
<b>Did you meet Hae Kang's mom?</b>

320
00:31:23,941 --> 00:31:25,300
<b>What did you say to her?</b>

321
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:28,970
<b>That's between me and his mom.</b>

322
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,510
<b>It's none of your business.</b>

323
00:31:31,611 --> 00:31:33,111
<b>Mom, please!</b>

324
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,851
<b>If something's wrong, you should fix it right away.</b>

325
00:31:36,851 --> 00:31:39,091
<b>Why would you struggle all by yourself?</b>

326
00:31:39,691 --> 00:31:40,990
<b>Don't let him tease you anymore.</b>

327
00:31:41,591 --> 00:31:42,720
<b>It'll only make him look down on you.</b>

328
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,591
<b>Okay?</b>

329
00:31:54,331 --> 00:31:55,671
<b>I'll let you know.</b>

330
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,901
<b>Hey, Joon Young. Joon Young.</b>

331
00:31:59,611 --> 00:32:00,710
<b>Did you come here to see your mom?</b>

332
00:32:02,371 --> 00:32:05,710
<b>Your mom needs to work and take care of you at the same time.</b>

333
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:07,980
<b>Her life must be so hectic.</b>

334
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,331
<b>Did you eat dinner?</b>

335
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,161
<b>Yes.</b>

336
00:32:26,101 --> 00:32:28,201
<b>My mom thinks we should go on a family trip.</b>

337
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:30,101
<b>When are you free?</b>

338
00:32:30,401 --> 00:32:32,070
<b>Not anytime soon. I'm too busy.</b>

339
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,881
<b>I got rid of the blanket here.</b>

340
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,351
<b>You should sleep in our bedroom from now on.</b>

341
00:32:41,581 --> 00:32:43,820
<b>Bring it back. I need to work all night.</b>

342
00:32:44,381 --> 00:32:45,581
<b>How long are you going to...</b>

343
00:32:45,581 --> 00:32:46,720
<b>Hey, Joon Young.</b>

344
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,661
<b>Are you doing well?</b>

345
00:32:51,921 --> 00:32:54,490
<b>Me? Yes, I got off work.</b>

346
00:32:55,861 --> 00:32:56,960
<b>Yes.</b>

347
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:00,300
<b>Oh, really? That's great.</b>

348
00:33:01,701 --> 00:33:03,540
<b>Sure. That sounds nice.</b>

349
00:33:12,881 --> 00:33:13,980
<b>Enjoy.</b>

350
00:33:36,701 --> 00:33:38,141
<b>You must be having a hard time these days.</b>

351
00:33:40,411 --> 00:33:43,240
<b>Your dad roughly told me everything, so I know what you're going through.</b>

352
00:33:47,081 --> 00:33:48,181
<b>What did he tell you?</b>

353
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:51,351
<b>That rumor...</b>

354
00:33:52,951 --> 00:33:54,191
<b>about your mom.</b>

355
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,720
<b>- It's not true. - I know.</b>

356
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,861
<b>I know it's not true.</b>

357
00:34:00,861 --> 00:34:04,361
<b>But the problem is that people think it's true.</b>

358
00:34:07,131 --> 00:34:08,270
<b>But Joon Young.</b>

359
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:15,271
<b>I bet your mom is also having a pretty hard time.</b>

360
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:20,380
<b>I don't want to talk to you about my mom.</b>

361
00:34:24,181 --> 00:34:26,251
<b>I don't have any negative feelings...</b>

362
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:29,220
<b>toward you and your mom.</b>

363
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:32,561
<b>I actually want the two of you to be happy.</b>

364
00:34:35,791 --> 00:34:38,400
<b>But unfortunately, things like this keep happening.</b>

365
00:34:42,871 --> 00:34:44,501
<b>I'll be honest with you.</b>

366
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:50,780
<b>If I were your mom, I'd want to leave this place.</b>

367
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:54,251
<b>She probably says she's okay,</b>

368
00:34:54,251 --> 00:34:56,150
<b>but I'm sure it's hard to bear with those rumors.</b>

369
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:02,760
<b>There's only one reason why she can't leave.</b>

370
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:06,961
<b>It's you.</b>

371
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:10,630
<b>She's enduring all this for your sake...</b>

372
00:35:12,231 --> 00:35:13,371
<b>because she's a mom.</b>

373
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:16,541
<b>It's because she's a mom.</b>

374
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,970
<b>I get it now that I've become a mother myself.</b>

375
00:35:23,211 --> 00:35:24,840
<b>That's how mothers are like.</b>

376
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,451
<b>So I've been thinking.</b>

377
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,961
<b>Why don't you move in with your dad?</b>

378
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:39,791
<b>Your mom is a competent doctor.</b>

379
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:43,461
<b>She'll have a very successful career once she leaves Gosan.</b>

380
00:35:43,701 --> 00:35:44,860
<b>You know that.</b>

381
00:35:48,701 --> 00:35:49,900
<b>Are you telling me...</b>

382
00:35:52,001 --> 00:35:54,141
<b>to abandon my mom and live with my dad?</b>

383
00:35:54,141 --> 00:35:55,670
<b>I'm saying you should think about...</b>

384
00:35:56,311 --> 00:35:58,880
<b>what will be best for both you and your mom.</b>

385
00:35:59,041 --> 00:36:00,510
<b>You're a middle school student now.</b>

386
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,780
<b>You're old enough to think about that kind of stuff.</b>

387
00:36:04,081 --> 00:36:06,550
<b>Plus, your dad wants to live with you.</b>

388
00:36:07,351 --> 00:36:09,021
<b>And I'd be happy to do that, too.</b>

389
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:12,090
<b>Okay?</b>

390
00:36:23,771 --> 00:36:24,970
<b>Good job, Sun Woo.</b>

391
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,041
<b>Mr. Cha's wife needs to learn her lesson.</b>

392
00:36:27,211 --> 00:36:28,271
<b>She was intimidated, wasn't she?</b>

393
00:36:29,481 --> 00:36:30,711
<b>I bet she was scared.</b>

394
00:36:31,411 --> 00:36:33,681
<b>I couldn't just let it slide.</b>

395
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:35,851
<b>So I went there and gave her a warning.</b>

396
00:36:38,681 --> 00:36:40,391
<b>But Joon Young got really angry about it.</b>

397
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:43,220
<b>He yelled at me.</b>

398
00:36:44,061 --> 00:36:45,391
<b>I don't know if it's because he's a son,</b>

399
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:48,291
<b>but it's getting harder to handle him.</b>

400
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,800
<b>I also wonder if it's because he grew up without a dad.</b>

401
00:36:54,431 --> 00:36:56,701
<b>You should be grateful that you don't have a kid.</b>

402
00:36:58,641 --> 00:37:00,711
<b>I know you can't live without Joon Young.</b>

403
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,541
<b>You're just bragging, aren't you?</b>

404
00:37:04,811 --> 00:37:05,880
<b>Did it show?</b>

405
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:10,581
<b>(Lee Tae Oh)</b>

406
00:37:17,061 --> 00:37:18,190
<b>What do you want?</b>

407
00:37:19,431 --> 00:37:20,530
<b>Where are you?</b>

408
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,561
<b>I need you to come home.</b>

409
00:37:59,415 --> 00:38:00,556
<b>Oh my gosh.</b>

410
00:38:06,955 --> 00:38:10,395
<b>Why are you so jumpy? It's only me.</b>

411
00:38:10,795 --> 00:38:12,466
<b>Why are you naked?</b>

412
00:38:12,466 --> 00:38:15,835
<b>I got sweaty after cleaning, so I washed up.</b>

413
00:38:18,366 --> 00:38:20,975
<b>Why did you do that? I never asked you to clean up.</b>

414
00:38:21,236 --> 00:38:22,605
<b>Leave if you're done.</b>

415
00:38:26,245 --> 00:38:28,815
<b>- Oh no! - What? What's wrong?</b>

416
00:38:29,716 --> 00:38:31,616
<b>Find me some underwear.</b>

417
00:38:55,136 --> 00:38:57,846
<b>I thought it would be wrong to take him when you weren't home.</b>

418
00:38:58,605 --> 00:38:59,875
<b>What do you mean?</b>

419
00:39:17,795 --> 00:39:19,065
<b>What are you doing?</b>

420
00:39:20,366 --> 00:39:21,596
<b>I'm done packing.</b>

421
00:39:22,765 --> 00:39:24,335
<b>Can we go now?</b>

422
00:39:24,966 --> 00:39:26,006
<b>Sure.</b>

423
00:39:26,605 --> 00:39:28,475
<b>You should go if you want to,</b>

424
00:39:30,946 --> 00:39:32,875
<b>but you should tell Mom first.</b>

425
00:39:33,475 --> 00:39:34,545
<b>What...</b>

426
00:39:38,346 --> 00:39:40,355
<b>Are you saying you'll go to Dad?</b>

427
00:39:42,156 --> 00:39:43,625
<b>I thought it over,</b>

428
00:39:44,926 --> 00:39:47,455
<b>and I feel like you can't live a comfortable life because of me.</b>

429
00:39:48,225 --> 00:39:49,625
<b>How could you say that?</b>

430
00:39:51,026 --> 00:39:52,725
<b>I live for you.</b>

431
00:39:52,725 --> 00:39:54,036
<b>Don't live for me.</b>

432
00:39:54,765 --> 00:39:56,605
<b>The more you do that, the harder it is for me.</b>

433
00:39:57,435 --> 00:39:58,835
<b>I can live with Dad.</b>

434
00:39:59,835 --> 00:40:02,636
<b>I think that would be best for both you and me.</b>

435
00:40:19,596 --> 00:40:20,895
<b>Did you pressure him?</b>

436
00:40:24,065 --> 00:40:25,395
<b>I saved you,</b>

437
00:40:27,736 --> 00:40:29,435
<b>and this is how you repay me?</b>

438
00:40:29,835 --> 00:40:31,835
<b>Joon Young called me and asked...</b>

439
00:40:32,705 --> 00:40:34,276
<b>if he could live with me.</b>

440
00:40:37,875 --> 00:40:40,846
<b>I'll keep him with me for a few days and talk to him.</b>

441
00:40:43,786 --> 00:40:45,645
<b>Don't worry too much, okay?</b>

442
00:40:52,855 --> 00:40:53,895
<b>Hey.</b>

443
00:40:54,756 --> 00:40:55,795
<b>Your briefcase.</b>

444
00:41:00,395 --> 00:41:01,495
<b>I'll come by often.</b>

445
00:41:35,636 --> 00:41:36,665
<b>Joon Young!</b>

446
00:41:47,545 --> 00:41:48,576
<b>Joon Young.</b>

447
00:41:50,045 --> 00:41:52,015
<b>Can we talk before you go?</b>

448
00:41:55,556 --> 00:41:57,625
<b>Please look at me.</b>

449
00:41:58,786 --> 00:42:00,225
<b>You should say bye to Mom.</b>

450
00:42:00,526 --> 00:42:02,926
<b>Forget it. Let's go.</b>

451
00:42:54,975 --> 00:42:55,975
<b>Come in.</b>

452
00:43:00,256 --> 00:43:02,955
<b>I'm glad you came. I'm sure we'll get along just fine.</b>

453
00:43:07,826 --> 00:43:08,926
<b>Go up.</b>

454
00:43:16,406 --> 00:43:17,636
<b>Thanks for understanding.</b>

455
00:43:45,995 --> 00:43:48,536
<b>You should call Mom and tell her you got here safely.</b>

456
00:43:49,596 --> 00:43:50,906
<b>She'll worry.</b>

457
00:43:54,076 --> 00:43:55,105
<b>Okay?</b>

458
00:43:56,076 --> 00:43:57,776
<b>It'll be easier for her without me.</b>

459
00:44:04,216 --> 00:44:06,455
<b>She won't have to put up with strange rumors because of me.</b>

460
00:44:09,515 --> 00:44:10,786
<b>Strange rumors?</b>

461
00:44:12,056 --> 00:44:13,056
<b>What rumors?</b>

462
00:44:13,056 --> 00:44:14,756
<b>Nothing is just between the adults.</b>

463
00:44:16,026 --> 00:44:17,366
<b>The kids know everything.</b>

464
00:44:18,866 --> 00:44:21,435
<b>It's more annoying being told to ignore it all.</b>

465
00:44:38,716 --> 00:44:41,355
<b>Did you meet Hae Kang's mom? What did you say to her?</b>

466
00:44:41,585 --> 00:44:43,225
<b>Mom, please!</b>

467
00:44:49,295 --> 00:44:50,395
<b>(Lee Tae Oh)</b>

468
00:44:54,835 --> 00:44:55,895
<b>Hey.</b>

469
00:44:56,966 --> 00:44:58,536
<b>Did you talk to Joon Young?</b>

470
00:44:59,705 --> 00:45:02,935
<b>He thinks you're putting up with those rumors because of him.</b>

471
00:45:03,806 --> 00:45:05,545
<b>He says he's fine,</b>

472
00:45:07,245 --> 00:45:08,815
<b>so if you don't want to live here,</b>

473
00:45:10,515 --> 00:45:11,745
<b>you can leave.</b>

474
00:45:14,915 --> 00:45:18,056
<b>Did he really say that? That I can leave?</b>

475
00:45:20,395 --> 00:45:22,156
<b>Why did he suddenly say that?</b>

476
00:45:22,826 --> 00:45:24,295
<b>Did you say...</b>

477
00:45:25,625 --> 00:45:27,136
<b>something to him?</b>

478
00:45:27,866 --> 00:45:29,096
<b>I did not.</b>

479
00:45:30,966 --> 00:45:33,776
<b>I don't know why he thinks that.</b>

480
00:45:34,006 --> 00:45:35,036
<b>He said...</b>

481
00:45:35,835 --> 00:45:37,846
<b>he's fine if he has me. That's all.</b>

482
00:45:39,776 --> 00:45:42,716
<b>It'll be only for a few days. Keep your promise.</b>

483
00:45:43,076 --> 00:45:45,545
<b>We have no choice if that's what he wants.</b>

484
00:45:45,545 --> 00:45:47,256
<b>Don't give me that garbage.</b>

485
00:45:47,756 --> 00:45:50,156
<b>Just make sure Councilman Cha doesn't run his mouth.</b>

486
00:45:50,455 --> 00:45:53,426
<b>If you still hang out with him knowing your child is hurt,</b>

487
00:45:54,026 --> 00:45:55,895
<b>you're not qualified to be Joon Young's dad.</b>

488
00:45:56,426 --> 00:45:57,526
<b>Got that?</b>

489
00:46:53,145 --> 00:46:54,286
<b>Cheers.</b>

490
00:47:03,196 --> 00:47:04,295
<b>Did you sleep well?</b>

491
00:47:04,466 --> 00:47:06,736
<b>You should eat breakfast. It's almost ready.</b>

492
00:47:07,565 --> 00:47:08,665
<b>I'm late.</b>

493
00:47:09,596 --> 00:47:10,806
<b>I'll see you later.</b>

494
00:47:13,806 --> 00:47:15,335
<b>Wait. I'll give you a ride.</b>

495
00:47:16,036 --> 00:47:17,776
<b>It's okay. I can go alone.</b>

496
00:47:18,676 --> 00:47:20,245
<b>But you said you're late.</b>

497
00:47:21,015 --> 00:47:22,616
<b>Let me drive you.</b>

498
00:47:23,286 --> 00:47:25,716
<b>- Don't you need some breakfast? - I'm okay.</b>

499
00:47:26,415 --> 00:47:28,315
<b>You'll be hungry before lunch.</b>

500
00:47:29,955 --> 00:47:31,056
<b>Gosh.</b>

501
00:47:32,786 --> 00:47:33,955
<b>Just buy something to eat.</b>

502
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:54,545
<b>(Mom)</b>

503
00:47:57,346 --> 00:47:59,286
<b>(Mom)</b>

504
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:01,185
<b>Hello?</b>

505
00:48:01,915 --> 00:48:03,056
<b>Are you on your way to school?</b>

506
00:48:03,286 --> 00:48:04,486
<b>Did you eat breakfast?</b>

507
00:48:05,185 --> 00:48:06,286
<b>Yes.</b>

508
00:48:07,256 --> 00:48:09,196
<b>What's wrong with your voice? Do you have a cold?</b>

509
00:48:10,065 --> 00:48:11,165
<b>No.</b>

510
00:48:12,466 --> 00:48:15,935
<b>Call me from time to time. I almost forgot your voice.</b>

511
00:48:16,806 --> 00:48:17,906
<b>Are you doing well?</b>

512
00:48:22,006 --> 00:48:23,036
<b>What about you?</b>

513
00:48:23,906 --> 00:48:26,676
<b>I'm doing well except that I miss you.</b>

514
00:48:29,475 --> 00:48:30,745
<b>I have to go.</b>

515
00:48:31,286 --> 00:48:33,716
<b>Okay. Do well in class...</b>

516
00:48:33,915 --> 00:48:35,716
<b>and have a fun day.</b>

517
00:48:36,156 --> 00:48:38,955
<b>By the way, when are you coming home?</b>

518
00:48:42,156 --> 00:48:43,966
<b>I'm hanging up. Let's talk later.</b>

519
00:48:44,026 --> 00:48:46,366
<b>Okay. Let's talk later.</b>

520
00:49:07,585 --> 00:49:10,855
<b>My wife asked if something happened to you, Dr. Sul.</b>

521
00:49:11,455 --> 00:49:12,886
<b>She says you don't call her anymore.</b>

522
00:49:14,026 --> 00:49:16,455
<b>The hospital's associate director position is out of the question now,</b>

523
00:49:16,826 --> 00:49:19,395
<b>so why would I call her?</b>

524
00:49:19,725 --> 00:49:21,495
<b>You're unexpectedly snobby.</b>

525
00:49:21,495 --> 00:49:23,866
<b>No, I'm quite open about being a snob like you.</b>

526
00:49:23,866 --> 00:49:27,276
<b>That's no reason to tell others about what we talked about.</b>

527
00:49:27,875 --> 00:49:30,506
<b>Do you know how embarrassing it is for me to see our nurses?</b>

528
00:49:30,506 --> 00:49:33,276
<b>That's why you should've given it a lot of thought...</b>

529
00:49:33,276 --> 00:49:34,645
<b>before saying what you did.</b>

530
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:36,515
<b>Hey, Dr. Sul!</b>

531
00:49:39,116 --> 00:49:40,315
<b>Good morning.</b>

532
00:49:48,795 --> 00:49:52,596
<b>This is a suggestion I'm making for business reasons.</b>

533
00:49:52,995 --> 00:49:55,866
<b>Dr. Kim, do you want to get married?</b>

534
00:49:57,165 --> 00:49:58,205
<b>Pardon?</b>

535
00:49:58,205 --> 00:50:00,636
<b>To get any approval from this hospital,</b>

536
00:50:00,636 --> 00:50:01,875
<b>you have to be married.</b>

537
00:50:02,136 --> 00:50:04,245
<b>If you're single, you won't even get a promotion.</b>

538
00:50:04,406 --> 00:50:06,006
<b>Right, Dr. Kong?</b>

539
00:50:06,875 --> 00:50:08,015
<b>What should I do, Dr. Kong?</b>

540
00:50:08,515 --> 00:50:09,645
<b>Should I register a marriage?</b>

541
00:50:14,015 --> 00:50:15,716
<b>You're so sour.</b>

542
00:50:24,866 --> 00:50:28,895
<b>The nurses are complaining too, so he's in a bind.</b>

543
00:50:33,165 --> 00:50:34,306
<b>You should stop making fun of him.</b>

544
00:50:35,506 --> 00:50:37,446
<b>He should officially apologize...</b>

545
00:50:37,446 --> 00:50:39,375
<b>whether it bothers him or embarrasses him.</b>

546
00:50:39,375 --> 00:50:41,475
<b>He should apologize to all the women working here.</b>

547
00:50:41,716 --> 00:50:43,815
<b>I'll support you in silence.</b>

548
00:50:48,786 --> 00:50:49,915
<b>We can register our marriage.</b>

549
00:51:00,435 --> 00:51:01,665
<b>What are you thinking about?</b>

550
00:51:04,265 --> 00:51:05,435
<b>Nothing.</b>

551
00:51:06,335 --> 00:51:07,435
<b>How's Joon Young?</b>

552
00:51:08,576 --> 00:51:10,946
<b>- Is he doing well? - Yes,</b>

553
00:51:12,306 --> 00:51:13,545
<b>he seems to be doing well.</b>

554
00:51:15,415 --> 00:51:16,716
<b>Do you want to go see a movie?</b>

555
00:51:19,846 --> 00:51:21,386
<b>You must be lonely alone.</b>

556
00:51:23,315 --> 00:51:24,426
<b>Maybe another time.</b>

557
00:51:56,585 --> 00:51:57,986
<b>What are you doing in here?</b>

558
00:51:59,886 --> 00:52:01,426
<b>Why did you just take him in?</b>

559
00:52:02,596 --> 00:52:05,725
<b>Do you think it'll be easy to raise someone else's child?</b>

560
00:52:05,966 --> 00:52:08,136
<b>He's not someone else's child. He's Tae Oh's son.</b>

561
00:52:08,236 --> 00:52:09,395
<b>I can't understand you either,</b>

562
00:52:10,236 --> 00:52:12,665
<b>but I really can't understand Dr. Ji.</b>

563
00:52:13,335 --> 00:52:15,736
<b>How can she send her son here? She's so shameless.</b>

564
00:52:15,975 --> 00:52:17,076
<b>Stop it.</b>

565
00:52:17,846 --> 00:52:19,375
<b>I suggested it.</b>

566
00:52:19,375 --> 00:52:20,716
<b>That's why I'm asking why you did that.</b>

567
00:52:21,116 --> 00:52:22,915
<b>Why are you making more trouble?</b>

568
00:52:22,915 --> 00:52:24,116
<b>Don't say that.</b>

569
00:52:24,915 --> 00:52:27,855
<b>To be honest, what did he do wrong? It's the adults who did wrong.</b>

570
00:52:28,216 --> 00:52:31,426
<b>Also, I'm partially responsible.</b>

571
00:52:33,696 --> 00:52:36,096
<b>I want to find a good path for Joon Young,</b>

572
00:52:36,926 --> 00:52:38,795
<b>so please just accept it.</b>

573
00:52:39,926 --> 00:52:44,306
<b>You're my daughter, but sometimes you surprise me.</b>

574
00:52:49,776 --> 00:52:52,006
<b>Hey, Tae Oh.</b>

575
00:52:52,806 --> 00:52:54,515
<b>I'll go over after picking up Joon Young.</b>

576
00:52:56,245 --> 00:52:57,346
<b>Okay.</b>

577
00:53:01,216 --> 00:53:02,415
<b>You still sound like a newlywed.</b>

578
00:53:04,526 --> 00:53:06,056
<b>My son's at home right now.</b>

579
00:53:06,556 --> 00:53:09,696
<b>You should take care of your son even if you're divorced.</b>

580
00:53:10,366 --> 00:53:12,096
<b>You're a good dad.</b>

581
00:53:16,636 --> 00:53:18,605
<b>What is it you want to talk about to bring you all the way here?</b>

582
00:53:18,736 --> 00:53:19,866
<b>Right.</b>

583
00:53:21,406 --> 00:53:23,036
<b>My book concert is coming up soon.</b>

584
00:53:25,605 --> 00:53:27,245
<b>("Communicating Is Having a Vision")</b>

585
00:53:27,576 --> 00:53:29,975
<b>Are you slowly preparing to go into politics?</b>

586
00:53:30,486 --> 00:53:31,716
<b>While we're on that,</b>

587
00:53:32,616 --> 00:53:34,116
<b>I want you to become my sponsor.</b>

588
00:53:34,486 --> 00:53:37,326
<b>Out of all of our classmates, you're the most famous.</b>

589
00:53:38,786 --> 00:53:39,886
<b>You'll agree, won't you?</b>

590
00:53:40,656 --> 00:53:44,026
<b>I'm not sure. I'm preparing a new movie,</b>

591
00:53:44,295 --> 00:53:46,495
<b>and I have to focus on Joon Young.</b>

592
00:53:46,765 --> 00:53:48,265
<b>It's hard to make the time.</b>

593
00:53:48,395 --> 00:53:49,866
<b>There's no need to make time for this.</b>

594
00:53:50,196 --> 00:53:53,205
<b>Just let me put your name down, and you can just show up.</b>

595
00:53:53,205 --> 00:53:55,276
<b>If I'm going to get involved, I should give it my best.</b>

596
00:53:55,776 --> 00:53:58,105
<b>It won't be helpful if I'm being sloppy.</b>

597
00:53:59,446 --> 00:54:01,676
<b>I'd rather not do it at all...</b>

598
00:54:02,545 --> 00:54:03,886
<b>then have you get upset over it.</b>

599
00:54:04,716 --> 00:54:08,056
<b>What is it? Do you need your father-in-law's approval?</b>

600
00:54:16,026 --> 00:54:18,165
<b>Let me say one thing since you came here as a friend.</b>

601
00:54:20,636 --> 00:54:22,495
<b>You should watch your mouth in front of your kid.</b>

602
00:54:22,736 --> 00:54:25,006
<b>You know very well our sons are friends.</b>

603
00:54:25,435 --> 00:54:27,205
<b>Didn't you think Joon Young would hear about it?</b>

604
00:54:27,205 --> 00:54:29,636
<b>Why are you bringing up our kids?</b>

605
00:54:29,636 --> 00:54:32,406
<b>You should've been more careful since they're involved too.</b>

606
00:54:33,306 --> 00:54:34,446
<b>Don't you agree?</b>

607
00:54:35,515 --> 00:54:38,085
<b>I'm not saying what Sun Woo did was good,</b>

608
00:54:38,616 --> 00:54:39,886
<b>but you disappointed me.</b>

609
00:54:41,515 --> 00:54:43,315
<b>My son was hurt.</b>

610
00:54:48,156 --> 00:54:50,026
<b>Stop bothering several people,</b>

611
00:54:50,466 --> 00:54:52,426
<b>and ask Chairman Yeo yourself.</b>

612
00:54:52,725 --> 00:54:55,466
<b>It's not me you need. It's him you want.</b>

613
00:54:55,795 --> 00:54:58,565
<b>- Come on, Tae Oh. - Don't live like that.</b>

614
00:54:59,906 --> 00:55:01,705
<b>Especially if you want to work in politics.</b>

615
00:55:02,036 --> 00:55:03,605
<b>It'd be humiliating.</b>

616
00:55:11,886 --> 00:55:13,145
<b>How's Da Kyung?</b>

617
00:55:13,716 --> 00:55:17,286
<b>I thought she might be anxious, but she's completely fine.</b>

618
00:55:18,826 --> 00:55:20,596
<b>She wants to treat him well.</b>

619
00:55:21,656 --> 00:55:24,966
<b>I guess this might be better if we don't want to get involved...</b>

621

<b>You should check on Da Kyung often...</b>

<b>to make sure she's really okay.</b>

<b>She has no experience with raising teenage boys.</b>

<b>You're right. I'm used to it.</b>

782
01:11:37,286 --> 01:11:39,685
<b>But now that it's gone, I realized...</b>

783
01:11:41,496 --> 01:11:43,996
<b>I used to think I needed passion for it to be love.</b>

784
01:11:45,725 --> 01:11:47,395
<b>I was such an idiot.</b>

785
01:11:50,065 --> 01:11:52,006
<b>It's like oxygen. Like water.</b>

786
01:11:52,866 --> 01:11:54,305
<b>Something you can't live without.</b>

787
01:11:57,076 --> 01:11:58,246
<b>I realized that's love.</b>

788
01:12:09,685 --> 01:12:12,885
<b>I lost her because I made a mistake, but I'm going to get her back.</b>

789
01:12:16,225 --> 01:12:17,925
<b>I don't want to regret it like you do.</b>

790
01:12:23,095 --> 01:12:25,036
<b>Do I look like I regret it?</b>

791
01:12:26,236 --> 01:12:27,906
<b>You don't look happy, that's for sure.</b>

792
01:12:40,385 --> 01:12:42,355
<b>Stop by when you have time.</b>

793
01:12:43,055 --> 01:12:44,555
<b>I packed some of Joon Young's things.</b>

794
01:12:46,855 --> 01:12:48,296
<b>Who is that? Your wife?</b>

795
01:12:49,956 --> 01:12:51,095
<b>Sun Woo.</b>

796
01:12:59,706 --> 01:13:00,805
<b>I think...</b>

797
01:13:01,805 --> 01:13:03,775
<b>Sun Woo is considering leaving town.</b>

798
01:14:01,565 --> 01:14:03,895
<b>I'm sure he didn't pack everything he needed because he was rushing.</b>

799
01:14:04,805 --> 01:14:08,105
<b>Tell him to let me know if he needs anything else.</b>

800
01:14:12,576 --> 01:14:13,876
<b>Are you really leaving?</b>

801
01:14:17,876 --> 01:14:18,986
<b>I'm considering it.</b>

802
01:14:20,116 --> 01:14:21,215
<b>Why?</b>

803
01:14:24,156 --> 01:14:25,456
<b>Isn't that what you wanted?</b>

804
01:14:30,156 --> 01:14:31,395
<b>It was.</b>

805
01:14:34,425 --> 01:14:35,996
<b>I'll talk to Joon Young,</b>

806
01:14:38,366 --> 01:14:39,635
<b>and leave if he wants me to.</b>

807
01:14:46,475 --> 01:14:48,076
<b>Can I trust him with you?</b>

808
01:14:59,456 --> 01:15:01,826
<b>I thought he meant he didn't want me to worry about him,</b>

809
01:15:04,656 --> 01:15:07,626
<b>but I feel like maybe he wants me to leave.</b>

810
01:15:09,036 --> 01:15:10,796
<b>A mom the kids gossip about...</b>

811
01:15:11,836 --> 01:15:12,965
<b>must be embarrassing.</b>

812
01:15:15,406 --> 01:15:16,675
<b>I'm sure he's sick of it.</b>

813
01:15:19,906 --> 01:15:21,916
<b>I think it's best for him that I keep my distance.</b>

814
01:15:29,086 --> 01:15:30,555
<b>But I'll take him back...</b>

815
01:15:31,855 --> 01:15:33,355
<b>if and when he wants.</b>

816
01:15:35,656 --> 01:15:36,696
<b>Okay.</b>

817
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:38,895
<b>Do that.</b>

818
01:15:46,666 --> 01:15:47,765
<b>Do you want some?</b>

819
01:16:35,086 --> 01:16:36,486
<b>How's that marriage?</b>

820
01:16:39,826 --> 01:16:41,425
<b>Do you still love her dearly?</b>

821
01:16:43,196 --> 01:16:44,456
<b>Why don't you tell me?</b>

822
01:16:47,425 --> 01:16:49,236
<b>What was marriage to you?</b>

823
01:16:50,465 --> 01:16:51,736
<b>And what did love mean to you?</b>

824
01:16:58,946 --> 01:17:00,475
<b>To me, marriage...</b>

825
01:17:05,715 --> 01:17:07,015
<b>was a delusion.</b>

826
01:17:09,815 --> 01:17:11,086
<b>The fence that protected me...</b>

827
01:17:12,925 --> 01:17:15,555
<b>and the stable foundation my life was built on...</b>

828
01:17:19,425 --> 01:17:21,465
<b>I thought no one would be able to break...</b>

829
01:17:21,465 --> 01:17:22,696
<b>what I thought was wholly mine.</b>

830
01:17:24,836 --> 01:17:27,135
<b>Love was the start of this delusion...</b>

831
01:17:30,206 --> 01:17:31,746
<b>and the end to my pains.</b>

832
01:17:33,475 --> 01:17:35,746
<b>It could've been a passing affair.</b>

833
01:17:38,385 --> 01:17:40,286
<b>Had you let it be one.</b>

834
01:17:43,486 --> 01:17:44,986
<b>Are you still telling me it's my fault...</b>

835
01:17:44,986 --> 01:17:46,525
<b>that we turned out this way?</b>

836
01:17:46,986 --> 01:17:48,055
<b>I just...</b>

837
01:17:49,156 --> 01:17:50,725
<b>gave it a thought.</b>

838
01:17:52,425 --> 01:17:55,135
<b>If you forgave me then,</b>

839
01:17:59,635 --> 01:18:00,765
<b>what would it be like now?</b>

840
01:18:06,046 --> 01:18:07,546
<b>You should go. It's late.</b>

841
01:18:08,206 --> 01:18:10,046
<b>What if I told you I regret getting remarried?</b>

842
01:18:12,145 --> 01:18:14,315
<b>That love wasn't any different.</b>

843
01:18:16,456 --> 01:18:17,885
<b>Would saying this help?</b>

844
01:18:20,956 --> 01:18:22,355
<b>Once love became marriage,</b>

845
01:18:22,355 --> 01:18:24,126
<b>everything turned out to be the same.</b>

846
01:18:24,725 --> 01:18:26,425
<b>What if I told you it's plain...</b>

847
01:18:28,536 --> 01:18:29,895
<b>and I've gotten sick of it?</b>

848
01:18:34,635 --> 01:18:36,236
<b>Will you tell me the truth too?</b>

849
01:18:39,706 --> 01:18:42,046
<b>- What truth? - That you regret what happened.</b>

850
01:18:44,645 --> 01:18:46,345
<b>For not forgiving me.</b>

851
01:18:46,715 --> 01:18:49,116
<b>For pushing me away and for making me a jerk!</b>

852
01:18:50,855 --> 01:18:52,456
<b>Tell me you're regretting it all.</b>

853
01:18:55,956 --> 01:18:58,525
<b>Tell me you still have feelings for me.</b>

854
01:19:00,265 --> 01:19:01,395
<b>You're crazy.</b>

855
01:19:01,395 --> 01:19:03,095
<b>It doesn't make sense otherwise.</b>

856
01:19:04,465 --> 01:19:05,866
<b>Why did you come all the way to the police station...</b>

857
01:19:05,866 --> 01:19:07,906
<b>to become my alibi?</b>

858
01:19:08,406 --> 01:19:11,435
<b>Why did you say such a lie for me?</b>

859
01:19:15,576 --> 01:19:16,876
<b>Be careful.</b>

860
01:19:18,315 --> 01:19:20,515
<b>There's no guarantee that you won't end up...</b>

861
01:19:23,756 --> 01:19:24,956
<b>like me.</b>

862
01:19:27,525 --> 01:19:29,126
<b>You should leave. You're drunk.</b>

863
01:19:31,925 --> 01:19:34,866
<b>Weren't you actually waiting for me to come back?</b>

864
01:19:34,965 --> 01:19:37,036
<b>You were waiting for me to go on my knees and beg...</b>

865
01:19:37,036 --> 01:19:38,296
<b>to get back together.</b>

866
01:19:39,706 --> 01:19:41,876
<b>Isn't that what you were waiting for?</b>

867
01:19:42,406 --> 01:19:44,275
<b>- I told you to leave. - That's why...</b>

868
01:19:44,275 --> 01:19:46,275
<b>you used Joon Young as an excuse to stay here!</b>

869
01:19:46,775 --> 01:19:49,515
<b>Even at this moment, you want to be in my arms!</b>

870
01:19:52,946 --> 01:19:54,246
<b>I know it's killing you.</b>

871

<b>Am I wrong?</b>

872
01:20:00,555 --> 01:20:02,696
<b>- You're insane. - Are you saying I'm wrong?</b>

873
01:20:11,166 --> 01:20:12,336
<b>Am I really wrong?</b>

<b>Should I...</b>

<b>go back to you?</b>

878
01:21:42,456 --> 01:21:43,525
<b>No.</b>

<b>All of these problems started because of the divorce, right?</b>

01:22:29,876 --> 01:22:30,906
<b>You're not even sure.</b>

884
01:22:30,906 --> 01:22:32,206
<b>Did you have to ask him when he was going to school?</b>

885

<b>Do you think it's puberty that made him do this?</b>

<b>Why are you seeing him again after all that?</b>

<b>You making amends...</b>
