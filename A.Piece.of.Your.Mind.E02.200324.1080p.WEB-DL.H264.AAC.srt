<b>No, never.</b>

3
00:00:59,567 --> 00:01:03,112
<b>I only want a small piece of her.</b>

4
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:08,051
<b>It was nothing.</b>

5

<b>I'm sorry.</b>

11

<b>I just...</b>

18

<b>wanted to do something for you.</b>

19
00:02:19,107 --> 00:02:22,391
<b>Do you know what the last thing he said to me was?</b>

20

<b>"Call me when you become miserable."</b>

21

<b>I became miserable,</b>

<b>I won't. I will never. Do you know why?</b>

24

<b>Before Dawn. They didn't meet.</b>

<b>Doesn't it feel so warm?</b>

49
00:06:27,957 --> 00:06:29,272
<b>It's a typical Korean house.</b>

50
00:06:30,697 --> 00:06:32,371
<b>How long were you in Seoul?</b>

51
00:06:33,096 --> 00:06:34,272
<b>I wasn't.</b>

<b>- College. - From the States?</b>

<b>You wanted to see me, so I left in the middle of a lecture.</b>

55
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,931
<b>I guess you have something important to tell me.</b>

56
00:06:58,457 --> 00:07:00,001
<b>Let's take some time to breathe before then.</b>

57
00:07:00,786 --> 00:07:01,996
<b>I'm okay now.</b>

58
00:07:01,996 --> 00:07:04,257
<b>Let's still do it. Otherwise, your mom will give me a scolding.</b>

59
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,472
<b>I said I'm okay.</b>

60
00:07:06,366 --> 00:07:08,102
<b>I know a park here. Let's go.</b>

61
00:07:17,106 --> 00:07:19,051
<b>Your mom always said...</b>

62
00:07:19,976 --> 00:07:22,116
<b>that you shouldn't live in Seoul...</b>

63

<b>That you should live around trees.</b>

65
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:30,361
<b>That was just briefly when I was a kid. I'm fine now.</b>

<b>Tell me. What did you want to tell me?</b>

67
00:07:39,096 --> 00:07:40,542
<b>Not yet.</b>

68
00:07:41,267 --> 00:07:43,496
<b>You and I always wondered...</b>

69
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:45,681
<b>what Korea was like.</b>

70
00:07:46,536 --> 00:07:50,152
<b>We could only imagine it before, but we're here together now.</b>

71
00:07:51,007 --> 00:07:52,222
<b>Let's take it slow.</b>

72
00:07:54,647 --> 00:07:55,852
<b>Do you have enough time?</b>

73
00:07:56,717 --> 00:07:57,821
<b>Yes.</b>

74
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:01,292
<b>- Should we go to that place? - Is there a place you want to go?</b>

75
00:08:02,257 --> 00:08:03,691
<b>Where you wanted to go.</b>

76
00:08:05,457 --> 00:08:06,532
<b>Me?</b>

77
00:08:10,457 --> 00:08:13,972
<b>A single leaf Lands on the shoulder</b>

78
00:08:15,267 --> 00:08:17,912
<b>Without making a sound</b>

<b>Cosmos laid its hand on me</b>

<b>"Sunset in Misiryeong", right?</b>

82

<b>Won, look.</b>

84
00:09:03,546 --> 00:09:05,991
<b>We always pictured this place together.</b>

<b>I'm so glad I came here with you.</b>

86

<b>I think I can say it now.</b>

87
00:09:35,146 --> 00:09:36,421
<b>I'm getting married.</b>

88

<b>(A Piece of Your Mind)</b>

89
00:09:57,037 --> 00:09:58,711
<b>So she ran away?</b>

90
00:10:00,136 --> 00:10:02,037
<b>She didn't exactly run away.</b>

91
00:10:02,037 --> 00:10:05,177
<b>That's the same thing. I mean, was that really necessary?</b>

92
00:10:05,177 --> 00:10:07,246
<b>She changed her mind and dumped him.</b>

93
00:10:07,246 --> 00:10:09,091
<b>It's ridiculous.</b>

94
00:10:12,717 --> 00:10:14,522
<b>Did Ji Soo dump him?</b>

95
00:10:16,016 --> 00:10:18,486
<b>I'll plant a lot of herbs here...</b>

96

<b>and make tea with the leaves...</b>

97

<b>- for our customers. - There's no way you'd tell me.</b>

98
00:10:27,896 --> 00:10:30,642
<b>After breaking up with Kim Ji Soo, he told me to...</b>

99
00:10:32,067 --> 00:10:33,311
<b>I was flabbergasted.</b>

100
00:10:38,236 --> 00:10:41,252
<b>My grandma was a diplomat.</b>

101
00:10:41,447 --> 00:10:43,547
<b>She felt guilty that she couldn't do anything for the Koreans...</b>

102

<b>who suffered injustice abroad.</b>

103
00:10:47,287 --> 00:10:48,762
<b>It's different now though.</b>

104
00:10:48,957 --> 00:10:51,516
<b>Anyway, Ha Won ended up alone...</b>

105
00:10:51,516 --> 00:10:54,862
<b>for a similar reason, and my grandma brought him here.</b>

106
00:10:55,396 --> 00:10:56,971
<b>That's how he became my uncle.</b>

107
00:10:57,096 --> 00:10:59,301
<b>- I told you about him before. - Yes, that he's so competent.</b>

108
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,211
<b>When I first saw him...</b>

109
00:11:03,636 --> 00:11:05,311
<b>Oh, he and I are the same age.</b>

110
00:11:05,437 --> 00:11:07,307
<b>I call him as Won or Uncle.</b>

111
00:11:07,307 --> 00:11:09,307
<b>Sometimes, that guy or hey. It all indicates him.</b>

<b>Specifically, we're going to keep...</b>

<b>through a circuit...</b>

118
00:11:27,427 --> 00:11:29,256
<b>He was in a lecture in the States...</b>

119

<b>when he got a call from Ji Soo, and he hopped on the next flight.</b>

120
00:11:33,366 --> 00:11:36,071
<b>He has been living in Seoul ever since.</b>

<b>Oh, that's the shipping address.</b>

127

00:12:29,587 --> 00:12:32,201
<b>Gosh, why am I crying over this?</b>

129

<b>Where did you live?</b>

130

<b>What does your address have to do with the research?</b>

<b>Where were you with Kim Ji Soo?</b>

<b>Gangneung.</b>

<b>When did you go to Gangneung with her?</b>

136

<b>We broke up there,</b>

137

<b>and I lived there alone for a few months the following year.</b>

<b>- What year was it exactly? - 2013.</b>

<b>2013?</b>

<b>Hey, where you lived is restricted,</b>

<b>I can get all the information...</b>

<b>if I ask indirectly relating it to Kim Ji Soo.</b>

<b>Try changing the password.</b>

<b>to improve its accuracy.</b>

00:14:08,417 --> 00:14:11,492
<b>I feel kind of bad.</b>

162
00:14:16,896 --> 00:14:18,132
<b>What?</b>

163
00:14:21,496 --> 00:14:22,941
<b>Since it's for treatment.</b>

164
00:14:23,467 --> 00:14:24,971
<b>For treatment?</b>

165
00:14:38,146 --> 00:14:39,586
<b>What do you think?</b>

166
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,792
<b>I like it.</b>

167
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:43,591
<b>Try mixing it.</b>

168
00:14:44,087 --> 00:14:45,087
<b>Pardon?</b>

169
00:14:45,087 --> 00:14:47,362
<b>Me? I'm still...</b>

170
00:14:47,657 --> 00:14:49,232
<b>You need experience to improve.</b>

171
00:14:49,657 --> 00:14:52,542
<b>You have a good ear, so I have high hopes for you.</b>

172
00:14:53,067 --> 00:14:54,642
<b>Thank you.</b>

173
00:14:57,197 --> 00:14:59,311
<b>It feels strange that all of us are here.</b>

174
00:14:59,636 --> 00:15:02,351
<b>If I join too, we'll have our original team again.</b>

175
00:15:02,577 --> 00:15:04,376
<b>What did the studio tell you?</b>

176
00:15:04,376 --> 00:15:06,047
<b>Did they make it clear yet?</b>

177
00:15:06,047 --> 00:15:07,451
<b>Not yet.</b>

178
00:15:09,846 --> 00:15:12,146
<b>We're recording a live play this week.</b>

179
00:15:12,146 --> 00:15:13,221
<b>And?</b>

180
00:15:13,947 --> 00:15:15,587
<b>Come if you want to watch.</b>

181
00:15:15,587 --> 00:15:17,762
<b>The place is small but nice for capturing sounds.</b>

182
00:15:17,957 --> 00:15:19,331
<b>It'll be helpful to you.</b>

183
00:15:20,687 --> 00:15:21,862
<b>I see.</b>

184
00:15:22,726 --> 00:15:23,872
<b>(Before Dawn, They didn't meet)</b>

185
00:15:28,467 --> 00:15:30,872
<b>Is Before Dawn not coming anymore?</b>

186
00:15:39,577 --> 00:15:41,152
<b>Excuse me.</b>

187
00:15:48,087 --> 00:15:49,762
<b>Did she say she was miserable?</b>

188
00:15:50,087 --> 00:15:52,327
<b>She was miserable, but she didn't say it.</b>

189
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:54,262
<b>That means she's miserable.</b>

190
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:01,502
<b>I'm done meddling with their relationship now.</b>

191
00:16:04,067 --> 00:16:06,136
<b>Order a drink if you want. I don't drink.</b>

192
00:16:06,136 --> 00:16:07,711
<b>I'm okay too.</b>

193
00:16:09,876 --> 00:16:12,782
<b>I feel so bad for that guy Ha Won.</b>

194
00:16:13,246 --> 00:16:15,275
<b>I don't feel bad for him at all.</b>

195
00:16:15,276 --> 00:16:16,951
<b>He's so like me.</b>

196
00:16:18,846 --> 00:16:20,016
<b>In what way?</b>

197
00:16:20,016 --> 00:16:22,532
<b>He believes it exists when it actually doesn't.</b>

198
00:16:22,587 --> 00:16:24,762
<b>I'm great at it, you know.</b>

199
00:16:25,287 --> 00:16:28,657
<b>I always run toward it, dream about it,</b>

200
00:16:28,657 --> 00:16:30,396
<b>read too much into it,</b>

201
00:16:30,396 --> 00:16:33,297
<b>and pour my heart and soul and my time into it.</b>

202
00:16:33,297 --> 00:16:35,671
<b>But for more than 10 years, he...</b>

203
00:16:36,467 --> 00:16:38,236
<b>Who has unrequited love these days?</b>

204
00:16:38,236 --> 00:16:40,136
<b>They're competitive even about love.</b>

205
00:16:40,136 --> 00:16:41,766
<b>They argue about who loves the other more.</b>

206
00:16:41,766 --> 00:16:45,482
<b>They measure and weigh love although it's unmeasurable.</b>

207
00:16:46,776 --> 00:16:49,992
<b>But he says a small piece of her is enough.</b>

208
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,417
<b>I guess he told you all sorts of things in hiding.</b>

209
00:16:53,417 --> 00:16:56,792
<b>How do you think he endured 10 years?</b>

210
00:16:57,187 --> 00:16:58,392
<b>I wonder.</b>

211
00:17:01,526 --> 00:17:03,671
<b>Wouldn't it be possible if she was precious to him?</b>

212
00:17:06,866 --> 00:17:10,612
<b>I think it would be possible if she were the center of his life.</b>

213
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:15,982
<b>You know how a single word can let some people go on living.</b>

214
00:17:20,307 --> 00:17:22,292
<b>A single word.</b>

215
00:17:23,516 --> 00:17:27,245
<b>There is something that I think would keep me going...</b>

216
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:30,262
<b>for about three years if someone would say it to me.</b>

217
00:17:30,657 --> 00:17:32,632
<b>Something no one ever says to me.</b>

218
00:17:35,386 --> 00:17:36,831
<b>"Stay."</b>

219
00:17:38,026 --> 00:17:40,566
<b>The real estate agent called me several times...</b>

220
00:17:40,566 --> 00:17:42,397
<b>to sell the semi-basement unit.</b>

221
00:17:42,397 --> 00:17:45,472
<b>I'd sell it off right away if it weren't for you.</b>

222
00:17:46,367 --> 00:17:48,141
<b>"Seo Woo."</b>

223
00:17:48,937 --> 00:17:50,236
<b>"Stay."</b>

224
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:51,576
<b>I'll get going.</b>

225
00:17:51,576 --> 00:17:53,452
<b>Okay, bye.</b>

226
00:17:53,576 --> 00:17:56,177
<b>- Now, the cello. - Okay.</b>

227
00:17:56,177 --> 00:17:57,752
<b>"Seo Woo."</b>

228
00:17:58,246 --> 00:17:59,692
<b>"Stay."</b>

229
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,871
<b>I wonder what Ha Won's next assignment will be.</b>

230
00:18:16,296 --> 00:18:17,911
<b>I doubt there will be any.</b>

231
00:18:18,296 --> 00:18:20,611
<b>Really? Did she say that?</b>

232
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:23,311
<b>(Eatery)</b>

233
00:19:13,657 --> 00:19:15,161
<b>I hear you're miserable.</b>

234
00:19:30,664 --> 00:19:32,199
<b>I hear you're miserable.</b>

235
00:19:40,874 --> 00:19:42,679
<b>I hear you're miserable.</b>

236
00:19:44,574 --> 00:19:46,520
<b>You haven't called in years,</b>

237
00:19:47,215 --> 00:19:48,414
<b>and the first thing you say...</b>

238
00:19:48,414 --> 00:19:49,889
<b>I told you to call me.</b>

239
00:19:53,685 --> 00:19:55,899
<b>I could tell you were unhappy even from behind.</b>

240
00:19:55,985 --> 00:19:59,600
<b>Why did you run so hard? You don't even run that well.</b>

241
00:20:04,824 --> 00:20:06,439
<b>It's been a while.</b>

242
00:20:10,404 --> 00:20:11,834
<b>I'm not miserable.</b>

243
00:20:11,834 --> 00:20:13,479
<b>Then why did you run away?</b>

244
00:20:14,604 --> 00:20:16,675
<b>Because you showed up out of the blue.</b>

245
00:20:16,675 --> 00:20:18,449
<b>Then how else was I supposed to show up?</b>

246
00:20:24,614 --> 00:20:27,760
<b>Won, I can't really talk right now.</b>

247
00:20:28,354 --> 00:20:30,459
<b>- Let's talk later... - Later when?</b>

248
00:20:39,394 --> 00:20:41,370
<b>Let's talk again in 20 minutes.</b>

249
00:20:46,904 --> 00:20:47,979
<b>(Ha Won)</b>

250
00:21:25,245 --> 00:21:27,320
<b>My fiance knows you.</b>

251
00:21:27,475 --> 00:21:29,260
<b>He seems to be bothered by you.</b>

252
00:21:29,985 --> 00:21:31,659
<b>Who is he that he knows me?</b>

253
00:21:32,985 --> 00:21:36,784
<b>He has been with me ever since you left.</b>

254
00:21:36,785 --> 00:21:38,959
<b>So you knew him in Norway?</b>

255
00:21:40,054 --> 00:21:41,195
<b>Who could...</b>

256
00:21:41,195 --> 00:21:43,070
<b>Can you not try to find out?</b>

257
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:44,870
<b>Please.</b>

258
00:21:53,404 --> 00:21:54,810
<b>Do you love him?</b>

259
00:21:56,045 --> 00:21:57,350
<b>Well,</b>

260
00:21:57,705 --> 00:22:00,414
<b>I feel like I grow when I'm with him.</b>

261
00:22:00,414 --> 00:22:01,675
<b>We get each other musically...</b>

262
00:22:01,675 --> 00:22:02,790
<b>So...</b>

263
00:22:05,314 --> 00:22:06,790
<b>do you love him?</b>

264
00:22:08,685 --> 00:22:09,899
<b>Yes.</b>

265
00:22:28,205 --> 00:22:31,080
<b>Please respect my decision.</b>

266
00:22:33,675 --> 00:22:35,189
<b>Of course, I do.</b>

267
00:22:37,045 --> 00:22:38,290
<b>But...</b>

268
00:22:42,054 --> 00:22:43,760
<b>you get married.</b>

269
00:22:46,394 --> 00:22:48,669
<b>I'll keep loving you as I always have.</b>

270
00:22:52,094 --> 00:22:53,995
<b>The fact that I love you...</b>

271
00:22:53,995 --> 00:22:56,310
<b>won't affect your life in any way.</b>

272
00:22:56,834 --> 00:23:00,649
<b>I'll never intrude on your life, so don't worry.</b>

273
00:23:05,074 --> 00:23:06,750
<b>Please respect my decision too.</b>

274
00:23:15,255 --> 00:23:16,659
<b>I have faith you'll be well.</b>

275
00:23:19,054 --> 00:23:20,199
<b>You have to be.</b>

276
00:23:22,925 --> 00:23:24,070
<b>But...</b>

277
00:23:26,295 --> 00:23:28,239
<b>call me when you become miserable.</b>

278
00:23:44,584 --> 00:23:48,760
<b>(Ji Soo)</b>

279
00:23:55,755 --> 00:23:58,699
<b>Sure. The voice recording, the shipping address...</b>

280
00:23:59,564 --> 00:24:00,810
<b>It was all you.</b>

281
00:24:01,965 --> 00:24:03,080
<b>Why?</b>

282
00:24:03,864 --> 00:24:05,010
<b>To refresh...</b>

283
00:24:10,604 --> 00:24:12,020
<b>your recollection.</b>

284
00:24:13,114 --> 00:24:14,719
<b>To call me when you become miserable.</b>

285
00:24:16,084 --> 00:24:17,545
<b>I wanted to do it once every 10 years,</b>

286
00:24:17,545 --> 00:24:19,189
<b>and you got me from the start.</b>

287
00:24:20,285 --> 00:24:21,459
<b>You and your "being miserable".</b>

288
00:24:22,725 --> 00:24:25,459
<b>I can't say I'm perfectly happy,</b>

289
00:24:26,554 --> 00:24:28,469
<b>but I can't say I'm miserable either.</b>

290
00:24:30,465 --> 00:24:33,810
<b>I'm sufficiently miserable and sufficiently happy.</b>

291
00:24:34,235 --> 00:24:35,540
<b>You're making no sense.</b>

292
00:24:38,265 --> 00:24:39,479
<b>I'm doing well.</b>

293
00:24:42,804 --> 00:24:45,120
<b>- Ji Soo. - I won't run away next time.</b>

294
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:46,949
<b>Okay?</b>

295
00:24:49,114 --> 00:24:50,219
<b>Ji Soo.</b>

296
00:24:52,015 --> 00:24:53,860
<b>"Ji Soo."</b>

<b>It's been so long...</b>

298
00:25:09,604 --> 00:25:12,209
<b>Hey. I'm doing just fine.</b>

299
00:25:12,804 --> 00:25:13,949
<b>Don't worry.</b>

300
00:25:23,045 --> 00:25:26,755
<b>I was going to ask you first before throwing it out.</b>

301
00:25:26,755 --> 00:25:28,030
<b>Why would you throw it out?</b>

302
00:25:28,785 --> 00:25:31,755
<b>Let's try leaving it out when it rains.</b>

303
00:25:31,755 --> 00:25:33,530
<b>Rain rejuvenates them at times.</b>

304
00:25:33,695 --> 00:25:36,199
<b>They grow crazy well when they get rainwater.</b>

305
00:25:36,265 --> 00:25:37,664
<b>What if someone steals it?</b>

306
00:25:37,664 --> 00:25:39,064
<b>Isn't it better if someone steals it...</b>

307
00:25:39,064 --> 00:25:40,969
<b>and saves it than it dying?</b>

308
00:25:43,104 --> 00:25:45,304
<b>- Hello. - Do you deliver?</b>

309
00:25:45,304 --> 00:25:46,449
<b>Of course.</b>

310
00:25:53,715 --> 00:25:55,449
<b>I guess he doesn't remember me.</b>

311
00:25:59,614 --> 00:26:00,959
<b>Do you want something in particular?</b>

312
00:26:02,154 --> 00:26:05,000
<b>- I'd like something small. - Look over there.</b>

313
00:26:07,425 --> 00:26:08,969
<b>Take your time.</b>

314

<b>Hello.</b>

<b>I recognized you as soon as you walked in.</b>

319

<b>- Don't you remember me? - Hello?</b>

320
00:26:50,664 --> 00:26:52,104
<b>Yes?</b>

321
00:26:52,104 --> 00:26:54,205
<b>Mr. Choi checked the cello sonata recording...</b>

322
00:26:54,205 --> 00:26:56,005
<b>and approved it,</b>

323
00:26:56,005 --> 00:26:57,750
<b>so I emailed you the file.</b>

324
00:26:58,545 --> 00:26:59,675
<b>I mixed it,</b>

325
00:26:59,675 --> 00:27:01,889
<b>but Mr. Choi said it was good.</b>

326
00:27:01,914 --> 00:27:03,860
<b>Would you please listen to it?</b>

327
00:27:04,715 --> 00:27:06,790
<b>It's the first I've ever mixed.</b>

328
00:27:06,884 --> 00:27:09,330
<b>- Congratulations. I'll check it. - Congratulations on what?</b>

329
00:27:13,795 --> 00:27:15,530
<b>I'll ask her once you're off the phone.</b>

330
00:27:16,324 --> 00:27:18,664
<b>Seo Woo, someone says she'll call you.</b>

331
00:27:18,664 --> 00:27:19,770
<b>Okay.</b>

332
00:27:20,295 --> 00:27:22,370
<b>Okay. Bye.</b>

333
00:27:23,334 --> 00:27:25,739
<b>You hung up already? I feel bad.</b>

334
00:27:26,574 --> 00:27:27,780
<b>Han Seo Woo. Han...</b>

335
00:27:32,945 --> 00:27:35,449
<b>Seo Woo. I hear congratulations are in order.</b>

336
00:27:36,245 --> 00:27:38,120
<b>What do you mean, how do I know?</b>

337
00:27:38,485 --> 00:27:40,360
<b>I told you. It's a small world.</b>

338
00:27:40,715 --> 00:27:43,159
<b>Will you come here if you're not busy?</b>

339
00:27:44,225 --> 00:27:45,729
<b>The address is...</b>

340
00:27:46,594 --> 00:27:48,830
<b>I wanted to clarify something.</b>

341
00:27:49,124 --> 00:27:51,600
<b>Can I keep working at the studio?</b>

342
00:27:52,225 --> 00:27:54,795
<b>Even when we don't have recordings scheduled.</b>

343
00:27:54,795 --> 00:27:56,209
<b>Most studios have someone like that.</b>

344
00:27:57,064 --> 00:27:58,209
<b>I don't know.</b>

345
00:27:59,064 --> 00:28:00,505
<b>Please tell me,</b>

346
00:28:00,505 --> 00:28:03,350
<b>so that I know whether or not to let the studio grow on me.</b>

347
00:28:06,914 --> 00:28:08,475
<b>I guess everything is personal to you.</b>

348
00:28:08,475 --> 00:28:12,790
<b>Of course. Every single thing, every corner, is mine when I work.</b>

349
00:28:13,614 --> 00:28:16,159
<b>Okay. Then it makes sense that you want to know.</b>

350
00:28:16,554 --> 00:28:17,699
<b>Give me a minute.</b>

351
00:28:30,864 --> 00:28:31,939
<b>Hey.</b>

352
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:36,780
<b>Tell her to stay.</b>

353
00:28:37,304 --> 00:28:38,379
<b>Okay.</b>

354
00:28:39,975 --> 00:28:41,120
<b>Stay.</b>

355
00:28:41,844 --> 00:28:42,919
<b>Excuse me?</b>

356
00:28:43,715 --> 00:28:44,959
<b>He says to stay.</b>

357
00:28:45,785 --> 00:28:47,760
<b>Keep staying at the studio.</b>

358
00:28:51,154 --> 00:28:53,429
<b>Is that Ha Won too?</b>

359
00:28:53,594 --> 00:28:56,300
<b>Your entire world is filled with Ha Won, isn't it?</b>

360
00:28:57,495 --> 00:28:59,870
<b>I was important to him.</b>

361
00:29:01,134 --> 00:29:04,939
<b>No one can be important to him on a personal level.</b>

362
00:29:06,275 --> 00:29:07,379
<b>Let's go.</b>

363
00:29:22,455 --> 00:29:26,129
<b>(Ji Soo)</b>

364
00:29:37,235 --> 00:29:38,310
<b>Hey.</b>

365
00:29:39,104 --> 00:29:41,280
<b>I was doing the laundry, so I couldn't pick up.</b>

366
00:29:41,804 --> 00:29:42,879
<b>What's up?</b>

367
00:29:43,275 --> 00:29:45,379
<b>Ji Soo even does laundry now?</b>

368
00:29:47,614 --> 00:29:49,919
<b>I'm so speechless, I can't help but laugh.</b>

369
00:29:51,745 --> 00:29:53,290
<b>You called for no reason, didn't you?</b>

370
00:29:55,654 --> 00:29:56,729
<b>That's right.</b>

371
00:30:23,515 --> 00:30:24,620
<b>You came.</b>

372
00:30:30,621 --> 00:30:35,621


373
00:30:42,495 --> 00:30:44,010
<b>(Ji Soo)</b>

374
00:30:47,834 --> 00:30:49,979
<b>(Sindongmun)</b>

375
00:30:57,785 --> 00:30:59,590
<b>You sent me a new message?</b>

376
00:31:01,255 --> 00:31:02,330
<b>It suddenly...</b>

377
00:31:04,225 --> 00:31:06,199
<b>got dark and started to rain, right?</b>

378
00:31:07,854 --> 00:31:10,469
<b>- Yes. - That's my message too.</b>

379
00:31:11,925 --> 00:31:13,570
<b>The sun rising, and setting,</b>

380
00:31:15,134 --> 00:31:18,540
<b>the wind blowing, and it raining. All of it.</b>

381
00:31:19,904 --> 00:31:23,149
<b>Everything you saw, heard, and gazed upon... Everything.</b>

382
00:31:24,545 --> 00:31:27,590
<b>It's my message to be happy wherever you are.</b>

383
00:31:48,594 --> 00:31:49,979
<b>It's from Kang In Wook.</b>

384
00:32:21,295 --> 00:32:23,505
<b>Is today the only day we can record it here?</b>

385
00:32:23,505 --> 00:32:25,479
<b>- Yes. Probably. - How much time do we have?</b>

386
00:32:25,864 --> 00:32:28,209
<b>One hour. It's hard to rent this place.</b>

387
00:32:31,945 --> 00:32:33,250
<b>Record that for me now.</b>

388
00:32:35,374 --> 00:32:36,520
<b>Seo Woo!</b>

389
00:32:37,584 --> 00:32:40,629
<b>Seo Woo. Can you find just the piano?</b>

390
00:32:42,584 --> 00:32:43,699
<b>Yes.</b>

391
00:32:44,354 --> 00:32:45,429
<b>Look for me.</b>

392
00:32:48,124 --> 00:32:50,370
<b>Was that not a person's voice?</b>

393
00:33:23,965 --> 00:33:25,199
<b>Stay here.</b>

394
00:33:26,164 --> 00:33:27,540
<b>In Wook.</b>

395
00:33:33,935 --> 00:33:37,580
<b>If I could apologize...</b>

396
00:33:40,745 --> 00:33:42,050
<b>To whom?</b>

397
00:33:44,744 --> 00:33:46,259
<b>Are you going to Oslo?</b>

398
00:33:46,615 --> 00:33:47,889
<b>Should I?</b>

399
00:33:54,854 --> 00:33:57,170
<b>If you're going to apologize to just scenery, do it here.</b>

400
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:02,710
<b>What if...</b>

401
00:34:05,865 --> 00:34:08,080
<b>I could apologize to Won?</b>

402
00:34:11,905 --> 00:34:13,620
<b>You don't keep in touch with him.</b>

403
00:34:15,545 --> 00:34:17,385
<b>I know his email address.</b>

404
00:34:17,385 --> 00:34:19,659
<b>- I can call... - It's nothing to apologize for.</b>

405
00:34:21,055 --> 00:34:24,199
<b>How many times must I tell you that it makes me miserable...</b>

406
00:34:24,255 --> 00:34:26,400
<b>and that it's too hard for me?</b>

407
00:34:27,894 --> 00:34:32,025
<b>Ji Soo. This isn't a problem as long as you're okay with it.</b>

408
00:34:32,025 --> 00:34:33,940
<b>It's not worth making us...</b>

409
00:34:37,635 --> 00:34:39,009
<b>like this.</b>

410
00:34:41,235 --> 00:34:43,049
<b>It's your problem now.</b>

411
00:35:57,014 --> 00:35:58,620
<b>I saw you come in.</b>

412
00:35:59,045 --> 00:36:00,630
<b>Do you know this place?</b>

413
00:36:00,954 --> 00:36:03,659
<b>This is my favorite cafe. Isn't it nice?</b>

414
00:36:04,055 --> 00:36:05,730
<b>You looked like you were watching someone.</b>

415
00:36:06,724 --> 00:36:08,330
<b>I was people-watching.</b>

416
00:36:08,494 --> 00:36:09,595
<b>I like doing that.</b>

417
00:36:09,595 --> 00:36:10,839
<b>Alone?</b>

418
00:36:11,724 --> 00:36:13,940
<b>Maybe someone will come.</b>

419
00:36:14,595 --> 00:36:16,264
<b>I'm so clueless.</b>

420
00:36:16,264 --> 00:36:18,109
<b>I'll go to another table.</b>

421
00:36:19,005 --> 00:36:21,175
<b>Actually, I have happy news.</b>

422
00:36:21,175 --> 00:36:23,449
<b>The studio said to keep coming.</b>

423
00:36:24,104 --> 00:36:27,549
<b>Congratulations. I won't be going there anymore.</b>

424
00:36:28,974 --> 00:36:30,489
<b>Did you finish?</b>

425
00:36:33,115 --> 00:36:35,589
<b>From now on, I'm going to enjoy coffee and music in the mornings,</b>

426
00:36:36,655 --> 00:36:38,060
<b>rather than cleaning.</b>

427
00:36:40,994 --> 00:36:42,400
<b>As you should.</b>

428
00:36:45,425 --> 00:36:46,870
<b>You see over there?</b>

429
00:36:47,264 --> 00:36:50,139
<b>That's where Ha Won missed Ji Soo.</b>

430
00:36:50,164 --> 00:36:52,279
<b>And I almost found Ha Won.</b>

431
00:36:56,135 --> 00:36:59,580
<b>Is there something you want to ask that person Ha Won?</b>

432
00:37:02,075 --> 00:37:03,460
<b>No.</b>

433
00:37:04,084 --> 00:37:06,389
<b>I just want to see him from afar.</b>

434
00:37:07,655 --> 00:37:08,960
<b>From afar?</b>

435
00:37:10,084 --> 00:37:12,400
<b>I want to see his face from afar.</b>

436
00:37:13,425 --> 00:37:14,624
<b>Why from afar?</b>

437
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:18,139
<b>If I'm too close, he'll see that I pity him.</b>

438
00:37:20,534 --> 00:37:22,040
<b>He'll see that look on my face.</b>

439
00:37:23,235 --> 00:37:25,735
<b>I want to see what he looks like from afar.</b>

440
00:37:25,735 --> 00:37:28,175
<b>"So that's what someone who does something like that looks like."</b>

441
00:37:28,175 --> 00:37:31,449
<b>I'll just look at his face. I wouldn't ask him anything.</b>

442
00:37:32,175 --> 00:37:35,190
<b>I hope you work a very long time at the place that asked you to stay.</b>

443
00:37:39,284 --> 00:37:40,359
<b>Thank you.</b>

444
00:37:45,124 --> 00:37:46,555
<b>Work here.</b>

445
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:48,699
<b>You said you were waiting for someone.</b>

446
00:37:49,425 --> 00:37:50,525
<b>I don't think the person is coming.</b>

447
00:37:50,525 --> 00:37:52,739
<b>I'm sure they will. I'll...</b>

448
00:37:54,635 --> 00:37:57,639
<b>There are plenty of other places nearby where I can work.</b>

449
00:38:15,514 --> 00:38:18,359
<b>Why am I sad to hear I won't see him again?</b>

450
00:38:40,115 --> 00:38:41,449
<b>Won,</b>

451
00:38:42,744 --> 00:38:44,659
<b>do you want to go to Norway?</b>

452
00:38:53,124 --> 00:38:54,255
<b>When?</b>

453
00:38:54,255 --> 00:38:56,170
<b>Tomorrow is good too.</b>

454
00:38:58,264 --> 00:38:59,469
<b>Why?</b>

455
00:39:00,064 --> 00:39:02,210
<b>I need your help.</b>

456
00:39:03,434 --> 00:39:05,810
<b>There's something I need you to do there.</b>

457
00:39:09,235 --> 00:39:10,449
<b>What is it?</b>

458
00:39:12,644 --> 00:39:15,014
<b>You just have to say one thing.</b>

459
00:39:15,014 --> 00:39:16,549
<b>What's that?</b>

460
00:39:17,345 --> 00:39:18,859
<b>I'll say it now.</b>

461
00:39:21,354 --> 00:39:22,885
<b>Well...</b>

462
00:39:22,885 --> 00:39:25,060
<b>It's okay. Tell me.</b>

463
00:39:25,954 --> 00:39:27,770
<b>Tell me, and I'll help you.</b>

464
00:39:28,695 --> 00:39:31,670
<b>I shouldn't have said anything. Sorry.</b>

465
00:39:32,124 --> 00:39:34,469
<b>- I'll call you again... - Let's go tomorrow.</b>

466
00:39:36,905 --> 00:39:38,739
<b>I'll help you, and then you can tell me.</b>

467
00:39:41,534 --> 00:39:44,104
<b>Okay. Let's meet at the cafe.</b>

468
00:39:44,104 --> 00:39:45,380
<b>I know.</b>

469
00:39:46,104 --> 00:39:47,549
<b>Where you ran away.</b>

470
00:39:50,244 --> 00:39:52,589
<b>See you there tomorrow morning...</b>

471
00:39:56,284 --> 00:39:58,259
<b>It's nothing to apologize for.</b>

472
00:39:58,525 --> 00:40:01,600
<b>How many times must I tell you that it makes me miserable...</b>

473
00:40:01,624 --> 00:40:03,969
<b>and that it's too hard for me?</b>

474
00:40:05,224 --> 00:40:07,094
<b>Never mind. No.</b>

475
00:40:07,095 --> 00:40:10,534
<b>I'll call you tonight after I think it over some more.</b>

476
00:40:10,534 --> 00:40:12,440
<b>What are you thinking about?</b>

477
00:40:14,974 --> 00:40:16,704
<b>It may be too hard for you...</b>

478
00:40:16,704 --> 00:40:17,920
<b>See you tomorrow.</b>

479
00:41:09,025 --> 00:41:10,540
<b>Are you here for the cafe?</b>

480
00:41:11,865 --> 00:41:13,100
<b>Yes.</b>

481
00:41:13,224 --> 00:41:15,040
<b>Would you like to wait inside?</b>

482
00:41:16,235 --> 00:41:17,509
<b>Thank you.</b>

483
00:42:30,905 --> 00:42:32,279
<b>Leave.</b>

484
00:42:33,715 --> 00:42:37,359
<b>I'll stay behind and find out why.</b>

485
00:43:17,184 --> 00:43:19,830
<b>I'm sorry again about the other day.</b>

486
00:43:19,985 --> 00:43:21,755
<b>Please call or text me when you have time.</b>

487
00:43:21,755 --> 00:43:24,264
<b>(I'm sorry again about the other day.)</b>

488
00:43:24,264 --> 00:43:25,295
<b>(I'm nearby.)</b>

489
00:43:25,295 --> 00:43:26,469
<b>I'm nearby.</b>

490
00:43:36,934 --> 00:43:38,049
<b>Over here.</b>

491
00:43:43,744 --> 00:43:45,819
<b>It can be a gift or a nuisance.</b>

492
00:43:46,584 --> 00:43:48,830
<b>- What is it? - A plant.</b>

493
00:43:49,314 --> 00:43:51,029
<b>Keep it if you can grow it.</b>

494
00:43:51,184 --> 00:43:54,100
<b>If not, just water it a little for a few days.</b>

495
00:43:54,255 --> 00:43:55,630
<b>It's quite finicky.</b>

496
00:43:55,894 --> 00:43:57,600
<b>I'm super good with plants.</b>

497
00:43:58,425 --> 00:44:00,370
<b>Then it's a gift. It's all yours.</b>

498
00:44:01,334 --> 00:44:03,139
<b>What were you doing nearby?</b>

499
00:44:05,735 --> 00:44:07,509
<b>I had something to decide.</b>

500
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:10,009
<b>I'm going to go alone.</b>

501
00:44:10,474 --> 00:44:13,179
<b>I'm scared, but I'm going to go.</b>

502
00:44:15,775 --> 00:44:18,819
<b>It concerns me that you're scared.</b>

503
00:44:21,985 --> 00:44:23,429
<b>I'll be fine.</b>

504
00:44:24,155 --> 00:44:27,029
<b>I gained courage the moment I told you.</b>

505
00:44:30,595 --> 00:44:31,799
<b>Tell me more.</b>

506
00:44:32,224 --> 00:44:34,670
<b>I'll listen to everything you want to say.</b>

507
00:44:35,834 --> 00:44:38,179
<b>I received a gift and everything. Say anything you want.</b>

508
00:44:38,805 --> 00:44:40,949
<b>It's okay if it's about things that upset you.</b>

509
00:44:58,755 --> 00:44:59,830
<b>Before...</b>

510
00:45:00,454 --> 00:45:02,230
<b>I met my husband,</b>

511
00:45:03,354 --> 00:45:05,500
<b>he did something...</b>

512
00:45:06,624 --> 00:45:08,609
<b>He made a mistake.</b>

513
00:45:11,405 --> 00:45:13,380
<b>Now that I found out about it,</b>

514
00:45:14,704 --> 00:45:16,250
<b>it's too hard for me to bear.</b>

515
00:45:18,575 --> 00:45:21,719
<b>My whole world turned upside down in an instant.</b>

516
00:45:24,545 --> 00:45:25,989
<b>This...</b>

517
00:45:27,314 --> 00:45:28,989
<b>This pain...</b>

518
00:45:31,255 --> 00:45:32,699
<b>is all new to me.</b>

519
00:45:35,854 --> 00:45:36,969
<b>This...</b>

520
00:45:38,325 --> 00:45:39,440
<b>is too...</b>

521
00:45:44,164 --> 00:45:45,639
<b>You didn't go to the mountain, did you?</b>

522
00:45:45,805 --> 00:45:47,779
<b>I said to go somewhere high up.</b>

523
00:45:48,075 --> 00:45:50,250
<b>It's therapeutic to look down on the world.</b>

524
00:45:50,974 --> 00:45:53,420
<b>You can scream as loudly as you can.</b>

525
00:45:55,445 --> 00:45:57,389
<b>Do you want to scream in there?</b>

526
00:45:57,744 --> 00:46:00,560
<b>It's soundproofed, so it's the best at relieving stress.</b>

527
00:46:06,325 --> 00:46:09,230
<b>There's something particular that you want to hear,</b>

528
00:46:10,865 --> 00:46:13,139
<b>and not these silly things, right?</b>

529
00:46:15,394 --> 00:46:17,880
<b>That one thing that you feel would make it all go away.</b>

530
00:46:22,505 --> 00:46:23,710
<b>"It's okay."</b>

531
00:46:27,814 --> 00:46:29,489
<b>"It's nothing."</b>

532
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:48,839
<b>Everyone makes mistakes.</b>

533
00:46:51,064 --> 00:46:52,880
<b>Even nature makes mistakes.</b>

534
00:46:56,405 --> 00:46:57,880
<b>My parents...</b>

535
00:46:58,974 --> 00:47:01,750
<b>died in a forest fire.</b>

536
00:47:04,414 --> 00:47:06,259
<b>I don't usually tell people this.</b>

537
00:47:12,755 --> 00:47:14,500
<b>Even nature makes mistakes.</b>

538
00:47:16,025 --> 00:47:18,469
<b>It's okay. It's nothing.</b>

539
00:47:30,905 --> 00:47:32,049
<b>Just a minute.</b>

540
00:48:02,374 --> 00:48:04,779
<b>(Dear Before Dawn. Please clean before you leave.)</b>

541
00:48:06,305 --> 00:48:08,620
<b>(Dear Before Dawn. Please clean before you leave.)</b>

542
00:48:12,545 --> 00:48:14,489
<b>"Nightlike afternoon."</b>

543
00:48:16,584 --> 00:48:18,830
<b>Even objects fall flat on their faces.</b>

544
00:48:18,925 --> 00:48:21,270
<b>It's just me and the machines. How strange is that?</b>

545
00:48:21,954 --> 00:48:24,299
<b>What is this?</b>

546
00:48:25,965 --> 00:48:27,069
<b>This?</b>

547
00:48:29,834 --> 00:48:32,139
<b>I think Before Dawn wrote this.</b>

548
00:48:33,664 --> 00:48:35,710
<b>I wonder what he does for a living.</b>

549
00:48:36,034 --> 00:48:37,549
<b>This is a flowchart.</b>

550
00:48:38,445 --> 00:48:39,580
<b>Dawn?</b>

551
00:48:39,805 --> 00:48:41,414
<b>I call him "Before Dawn"...</b>

552
00:48:41,414 --> 00:48:43,719
<b>because he rents this space for four hours early in the morning.</b>

553
00:48:44,885 --> 00:48:46,744
<b>You know, I ran into him yesterday...</b>

554
00:48:46,744 --> 00:48:48,190
<b>at the cafe we go to all the time.</b>

555
00:48:48,755 --> 00:48:50,190
<b>He said he won't be coming anymore.</b>

556
00:48:53,255 --> 00:48:55,500
<b>He asked out of the blue if I was miserable,</b>

557
00:48:55,825 --> 00:48:57,130
<b>so I wondered why.</b>

558
00:48:58,595 --> 00:48:59,940
<b>So this is how he knew.</b>

559
00:49:03,695 --> 00:49:06,509
<b>You said you never saw Ha Won, right?</b>

560
00:49:06,664 --> 00:49:09,509
<b>Yes. I saw him from behind from far away. That's all.</b>

561
00:49:12,204 --> 00:49:13,620
<b>I think you will see him.</b>

562
00:49:14,014 --> 00:49:15,690
<b>You may have already.</b>

563
00:49:17,615 --> 00:49:18,719
<b>What?</b>

564
00:49:20,314 --> 00:49:21,429
<b>I'm glad.</b>

565
00:52:01,075 --> 00:52:02,319
<b>Is something wrong?</b>

566
00:52:03,744 --> 00:52:05,420
<b>I can't concentrate.</b>

567
00:52:08,584 --> 00:52:10,230
<b>I can't reschedule anymore.</b>

568
00:52:13,724 --> 00:52:16,529
<b>One more song and we're done.</b>

569
00:52:22,334 --> 00:52:23,670
<b>Why did you go?</b>

570
00:52:27,874 --> 00:52:29,279
<b>Why?</b>

571
00:52:40,615 --> 00:52:43,089
<b>- Please take your time. - Thank you.</b>

572
00:53:29,894 --> 00:53:32,139
<b>This isn't good.</b>

573
00:54:41,905 --> 00:54:45,480
<b>Nice. That was good.</b>

574
00:57:00,305 --> 00:57:01,989
<b>I guess she isn't coming today either.</b>

575
00:57:02,545 --> 00:57:04,075
<b>She'll come eventually.</b>

576
00:57:04,075 --> 00:57:06,945
<b>Once she does, I'll testify as to how much you waited.</b>

577
00:57:06,945 --> 00:57:08,555
<b>Make sure to collect for it all.</b>

578
00:57:08,555 --> 00:57:10,255
<b>You have to. You promised.</b>

579
00:57:10,255 --> 00:57:11,429
<b>I will.</b>

580
00:57:12,954 --> 00:57:16,500
<b>The moon is huge tonight. It looks like it's coming toward us.</b>

581
00:57:21,465 --> 00:57:23,040
<b>Make a wish.</b>

582
00:57:24,064 --> 00:57:25,339
<b>She'll come.</b>

583
00:57:42,215 --> 00:57:43,560
<b>Hello?</b>

584
00:57:43,655 --> 00:57:45,359
<b>It's...</b>

585
00:57:45,755 --> 00:57:47,429
<b>blinding here.</b>

586
00:57:47,624 --> 00:57:49,529
<b>It's so nice.</b>

587
00:57:51,795 --> 00:57:55,069
<b>Now that I'm here, I wonder why I lived like that.</b>

588
00:57:55,735 --> 00:57:57,334
<b>All my anxiety lifted.</b>

589
00:57:57,334 --> 00:57:58,779
<b>Where are you?</b>

590
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:02,179
<b>I'm on the path I used to walk all the time with Won.</b>

591
00:58:02,635 --> 00:58:04,210
<b>In Norway?</b>

592
00:58:07,474 --> 00:58:09,944
<b>How did I forget this place?</b>

593
00:58:09,945 --> 00:58:12,314
<b>Did you always have such a cheerful voice?</b>

594
00:58:12,314 --> 00:58:14,290
<b>Your voice sounds completely different.</b>

595
00:58:14,854 --> 00:58:16,655
<b>I'm glad you went.</b>

596
00:58:16,655 --> 00:58:18,853
<b>I can handle it all.</b>

597
00:58:18,854 --> 00:58:20,929
<b>I'm a tough girl.</b>

598
00:58:21,325 --> 00:58:23,630
<b>I'm so glad I came alone.</b>

599
00:58:25,724 --> 00:58:27,525
<b>Seo Woo.</b>

600
00:58:27,525 --> 00:58:31,739
<b>Would you please tell Won not to wait at the cafe?</b>

601
00:58:32,064 --> 00:58:33,904
<b>I just came.</b>

602
00:58:33,905 --> 00:58:37,945
<b>He's very simpleminded, so I feel like he'll keep waiting.</b>

603
00:58:37,945 --> 00:58:40,275
<b>I told you, I don't know who he is.</b>

604
00:58:40,275 --> 00:58:42,020
<b>It's so easy.</b>

605
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:43,845
<b>It's a quiz.</b>

606
00:58:43,845 --> 00:58:46,620
<b>I'll call you in a bit. Solve the quiz, okay?</b>

607
00:58:48,084 --> 00:58:49,330
<b>I'll give you a hint.</b>

608
00:58:49,655 --> 00:58:51,730
<b>You've already met him.</b>

609
00:58:54,425 --> 00:58:56,469
<b>I'll call you later.</b>

610
00:58:56,894 --> 00:58:58,000
<b>But...</b>

611
00:58:59,994 --> 00:59:01,870
<b>Who's Ha Won?</b>

612
00:59:07,264 --> 00:59:09,310
<b>Wouldn't it be possible if she was precious to him?</b>

613
00:59:10,275 --> 00:59:14,020
<b>I think it would be possible if she were the center of his life.</b>

614
00:59:15,045 --> 00:59:16,589
<b>No way.</b>

615
00:59:20,644 --> 00:59:23,989
<b>I became miserable, but I didn't call him.</b>

616
00:59:24,084 --> 00:59:25,900
<b>Did she say she was miserable?</b>

617
00:59:30,795 --> 00:59:31,894
<b>"Stay."</b>

618
00:59:31,894 --> 00:59:35,235
<b>He says to stay. Keep staying at the studio.</b>

619
00:59:35,235 --> 00:59:38,239
<b>I hope you work a very long time at the place that asked you to stay.</b>

620
00:59:40,135 --> 00:59:42,250
<b>Was that you too?</b>

621
00:59:43,934 --> 00:59:46,350
<b>Ms. Moon.</b>

622
01:00:33,038 --> 01:00:35,952
<b>I told you, I quit the piano a long time ago.</b>

623
01:00:36,277 --> 01:00:39,678
<b>You were the only one who didn't know that your favorite pupil...</b>

624
01:00:39,678 --> 01:00:41,392
<b>just didn't have the skills.</b>

625
01:00:44,478 --> 01:00:47,348
<b>Won lives in Seoul, but his skin is fine.</b>

626
01:00:47,348 --> 01:00:49,193
<b>He's very healthy.</b>

627
01:01:14,078 --> 01:01:16,323
<b>Won's mother, whom I love...</b>

628
01:01:17,178 --> 01:01:19,492
<b>and miss so very much.</b>

629
01:01:21,857 --> 01:01:23,532
<b>May I...</b>

630
01:01:26,558 --> 01:01:28,702
<b>apologize on his behalf?</b>

631
01:03:27,107 --> 01:03:28,823
<b>(Kim Ji Soo)</b>

632
01:03:31,518 --> 01:03:34,323
<b>Is he really Before Dawn? Is Ha Won Before Dawn?</b>

633
01:03:38,187 --> 01:03:39,262
<b>Hello?</b>

634
01:03:40,087 --> 01:03:41,233
