00:00:15,407 --> 00:00:18,252
<b>Yes. Jung Seo Yeon.</b>

4
00:00:19,537 --> 00:00:20,682
<b>Do you know her?</b>

5
00:00:24,846 --> 00:00:27,921
<b>No, I've never heard that name before.</b>

6

<b>Who is that?</b>

<b>(Patient Chart: Yeo Ha Jin)</b>

8
00:00:48,007 --> 00:00:49,681
<b>Why are you asking me?</b>

9
00:00:50,136 --> 00:00:52,512
<b>You need to explain to help me take a guess.</b>

10
00:00:53,076 --> 00:00:55,522
<b>Is she famous? Is she an actress?</b>

11
00:00:56,246 --> 00:00:57,617
<b>I may have met her,</b>

12
00:00:57,617 --> 00:00:59,776
<b>but I could have forgotten.</b>

13
00:00:59,776 --> 00:01:01,617
<b>I don't have a great memory.</b>

14
00:01:01,617 --> 00:01:03,961
<b>You said you got injured and stopped doing ballet, right?</b>

15
00:01:05,917 --> 00:01:07,632
<b>When exactly was that?</b>

16
00:01:09,126 --> 00:01:10,802
<b>My first year in college.</b>

17
00:01:11,227 --> 00:01:13,132
<b>I got into a motorcycle accident...</b>

18
00:01:13,227 --> 00:01:15,371
<b>and hurt my ankle badly.</b>

19
00:01:16,936 --> 00:01:18,597
<b>Why do you suddenly ask me this?</b>

20
00:01:18,597 --> 00:01:19,972
<b>What's with you?</b>

21

<b>Call your sister here and go.</b>

24

<b>What do you think you're doing?</b>

25
00:01:37,356 --> 00:01:38,532
<b>No.</b>

26
00:01:38,886 --> 00:01:40,731
<b>I can't leave like this. I won't.</b>

27
00:01:41,287 --> 00:01:42,386
<b>You need to tell me...</b>

28
00:01:42,386 --> 00:01:44,431
<b>why you're doing this and who Jung Seo Yeon is.</b>

29
00:01:44,856 --> 00:01:46,371
<b>I'll go once you tell me.</b>

30
00:01:46,966 --> 00:01:48,272
<b>I can't tell you.</b>

31
00:01:49,897 --> 00:01:51,371
<b>So you need to go.</b>

32
00:01:52,367 --> 00:01:53,882
<b>Call your sister,</b>

33
00:01:54,307 --> 00:01:56,211
<b>take a taxi, or walk.</b>

34
00:01:57,636 --> 00:01:58,851
<b>You need to go.</b>

35
00:02:04,716 --> 00:02:06,492
<b>Then I'll drop you off.</b>

<b>(Find Me in Your Memory)</b>

37
00:02:48,727 --> 00:02:51,602
<b>Why wouldn't she explain anything and just tell me to come?</b>

38
00:02:53,157 --> 00:02:55,467
<b>I think we're here. Could you stop?</b>

39
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:56,542
<b>Sure.</b>

40
00:02:59,497 --> 00:03:01,042
<b>Please wait a minute.</b>

41
00:03:08,706 --> 00:03:09,806
<b>Hello.</b>

42
00:03:09,806 --> 00:03:11,352
<b>- Hello. - Hello.</b>

43
00:03:13,546 --> 00:03:14,792
<b>You're early.</b>

44
00:03:14,886 --> 00:03:16,316
<b>Where are we?</b>

45
00:03:16,317 --> 00:03:17,586
<b>It's his house.</b>

46
00:03:17,586 --> 00:03:18,691
<b>"His house"?</b>

47
00:03:22,157 --> 00:03:23,657
<b>What did you two do in there?</b>

48
00:03:23,657 --> 00:03:25,172
<b>Nothing.</b>

49
00:03:26,356 --> 00:03:28,426
<b>I just dropped him off.</b>

50
00:03:28,426 --> 00:03:30,072
<b>You did what?</b>

51
00:03:30,866 --> 00:03:33,172
<b>Can't a grown man go home alone?</b>

52
00:03:33,866 --> 00:03:35,681
<b>It's late. Let's talk at home.</b>

53
00:03:42,646 --> 00:03:44,852
<b>What are we doing outside so late at night?</b>

54
00:04:00,826 --> 00:04:02,702
<b>Please go back.</b>

55
00:04:22,546 --> 00:04:25,032
<b>Why did she leave her car here?</b>

56
00:04:25,486 --> 00:04:28,732
<b>So what? Am I supposed to get it back?</b>

57
00:04:29,426 --> 00:04:31,602
<b>Of course, I should. Right.</b>

58
00:04:32,227 --> 00:04:33,602
<b>Let's go.</b>

59
00:04:55,486 --> 00:04:57,587
<b>There wasn't a traffic jam, right? Do you want some coffee?</b>

60
00:04:57,587 --> 00:05:00,191
<b>Forget about coffee. Let's straighten things out.</b>

61
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:02,056
<b>What did you do with Anchor Lee?</b>

62
00:05:02,056 --> 00:05:04,327
<b>I already told you everything yesterday.</b>

63
00:05:04,327 --> 00:05:06,426
<b>I want to check.</b>

64
00:05:06,426 --> 00:05:10,227
<b>So you two decided to act as if you're dating.</b>

65
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:13,606
<b>No, wait. You officially asked him out,</b>

66
00:05:13,606 --> 00:05:14,736
<b>but he said no?</b>

67
00:05:14,736 --> 00:05:16,235
<b>You heard me right the first time.</b>

68
00:05:16,236 --> 00:05:18,137
<b>I'm so speechless.</b>

69
00:05:18,137 --> 00:05:21,106
<b>Why would he dump you then ask to be dropped off at home?</b>

70
00:05:21,106 --> 00:05:24,552
<b>I offered to do so. It's nothing.</b>

71
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:26,422
<b>Why are you getting all worked up?</b>

72
00:05:26,577 --> 00:05:28,217
<b>I know you're the exhausting type...</b>

73
00:05:28,217 --> 00:05:30,186
<b>and have been dumped often.</b>

74
00:05:30,186 --> 00:05:32,587
<b>But no one has ever rejected you from the beginning.</b>

75
00:05:32,587 --> 00:05:34,426
<b>I was dumped only once for being too exhausting.</b>

76
00:05:34,426 --> 00:05:36,287
<b>No, there were numerous times. They just didn't tell you.</b>

77
00:05:36,287 --> 00:05:38,657
<b>Like who? Dong Joon? Min Seok?</b>

78
00:05:38,657 --> 00:05:40,842
<b>Forget it. What's the point?</b>

79
00:05:41,566 --> 00:05:42,827
<b>There's no way.</b>

80
00:05:42,827 --> 00:05:44,011
<b>Forget what I said.</b>

81
00:05:44,167 --> 00:05:46,337
<b>I'm getting hungry from getting all worked up.</b>

82
00:05:46,337 --> 00:05:47,407
<b>Are you going to have ramyeon?</b>

83
00:05:47,407 --> 00:05:49,037
<b>Yes. You can't, right?</b>

84
00:05:49,037 --> 00:05:52,681
<b>No, I'm on a diet. Lucky you.</b>

85
00:05:52,777 --> 00:05:54,577
<b>Tell me right now if you're going to have some.</b>

86
00:05:54,577 --> 00:05:56,552
<b>If not, I'm going to cook just enough for myself.</b>

87
00:05:56,977 --> 00:05:58,492
<b>No, I won't eat.</b>

88
00:06:01,287 --> 00:06:04,462
<b>Right, do you know who Jung Seo Yeon is?</b>

89
00:06:07,556 --> 00:06:09,061
<b>Are you okay?</b>

90
00:06:13,356 --> 00:06:15,271
<b>I'm so famished that I have no energy.</b>

91
00:06:17,496 --> 00:06:18,871
<b>What was the name again?</b>

92
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,612
<b>Jung Seo Yeon.</b>

93
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:24,212
<b>Do you know her? I don't.</b>

94
00:06:24,876 --> 00:06:26,352
<b>Me neither.</b>

95
00:06:26,876 --> 00:06:28,381
<b>But why all of a sudden?</b>

96
00:06:28,746 --> 00:06:31,722
<b>Jeong Hoon asked yesterday whether I knew her or not.</b>

97
00:06:31,816 --> 00:06:33,792
<b>He did? Why?</b>

98
00:06:34,246 --> 00:06:36,162
<b>I don't know. He didn't say why.</b>

99
00:06:38,256 --> 00:06:40,555
<b>I can't take this. I'll have half of the ramyeon.</b>

100
00:06:40,556 --> 00:06:42,602
<b>I can exercise afterward, right?</b>

101
00:06:42,686 --> 00:06:43,802
<b>Yes.</b>

102
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,871
<b>Don't cook it for too long.</b>

103

<b>Hold on. You guys got it wrong.</b>

114
00:07:56,626 --> 00:07:59,542
<b>You've made the same mistake again.</b>

115

<b>You have something in your teeth.</b>

116

<b>Ha jin, Seo Yeon. What did I tell you?</b>

<b>You shouldn't eat anything before your performance.</b>

<b>- Come on out. - It's nothing.</b>

<b>- Why did you laugh? - What?</b>

121

<b>You laughed first.</b>

<b>We can start now.</b>

151

<b>Then do you want to bike along the Han River?</b>

00:10:55,046 --> 00:10:56,121
<b>Okay.</b>

162
00:10:56,777 --> 00:10:58,121
<b>What should we have there?</b>

163
00:10:58,277 --> 00:10:59,976
<b>- Tteokbokki. - And?</b>

164
00:10:59,976 --> 00:11:01,487
<b>And the sweet and sour chicken we talked about before.</b>

165
00:11:01,487 --> 00:11:02,787
<b>I love that.</b>

166
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:03,891
<b>It's really good, right?</b>

167
00:11:09,887 --> 00:11:12,871
<b>(Dear Ha Na, this is the last page of our diary.)</b>

168
00:11:15,267 --> 00:11:18,212
<b>Ha Kyung, come on out. The ramyeon is getting too soggy.</b>

169
00:11:18,267 --> 00:11:19,336
<b>I'm going to finish it.</b>

170
00:11:19,336 --> 00:11:21,742
<b>Stop right there. I'm coming.</b>

171
00:11:27,377 --> 00:11:29,647
<b>- Look this way! - Ha Jin!</b>

172
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,051
<b>I love you!</b>

173
00:11:31,976 --> 00:11:34,815
<b>Ha Jin, so many of your fans are here.</b>

174
00:11:34,816 --> 00:11:35,992
<b>Really?</b>

175
00:11:42,257 --> 00:11:43,432
<b>We'll begin now.</b>

176
00:11:45,027 --> 00:11:46,556
<b>I'm Kim Ea Na, and this is "Nighttime Letters".</b>

177
00:11:46,556 --> 00:11:50,897
<b>Ever since its release, the movie has received a lot of love.</b>

178
00:11:50,897 --> 00:11:52,537
<b>I'm here with Yeo Ha Jin,</b>

179
00:11:52,537 --> 00:11:55,367
<b>the female lead of "My First Love".</b>

180
00:11:55,367 --> 00:11:58,537
<b>Could you describe the movie...</b>

181
00:11:58,537 --> 00:12:00,781
<b>in one phrase?</b>

182
00:12:01,777 --> 00:12:04,816
<b>I could say that it's a sadistic movie.</b>

183
00:12:04,816 --> 00:12:06,147
<b>"Sadistic"?</b>

184
00:12:06,147 --> 00:12:07,387
<b>Is it the same definition...</b>

185
00:12:07,387 --> 00:12:09,946
<b>that I'm aware of as in to abuse someone?</b>

186
00:12:09,946 --> 00:12:11,086
<b>Yes, that's correct.</b>

187
00:12:11,086 --> 00:12:14,426
<b>This movie can shake things up emotionally,</b>

188
00:12:14,426 --> 00:12:16,387
<b>so if you watch the movie, it might be painful.</b>

189
00:12:16,387 --> 00:12:20,426
<b>I see. So you chose that description in a positive way.</b>

190
00:12:20,426 --> 00:12:23,696
<b>Yes. Here's a story from the movie.</b>

191
00:12:23,696 --> 00:12:27,507
<b>Love can shake things up for people, you know.</b>

192
00:12:27,507 --> 00:12:28,982
<b>So it gets painful.</b>

193
00:12:29,637 --> 00:12:31,781
<b>And the most painful moment is...</b>

194
00:12:32,936 --> 00:12:35,076
<b>when your happiest moments...</b>

195
00:12:35,076 --> 00:12:37,452
<b>become the saddest memories.</b>

196
00:12:39,316 --> 00:12:41,661
<b>So on some days, you want to forget about them.</b>

197
00:12:42,247 --> 00:12:44,932
<b>But on some days, you never want to forget.</b>

198
00:12:47,387 --> 00:12:50,127
<b>So in the movie, Ae Young is torn...</b>

199
00:12:50,127 --> 00:12:51,857
<b>because once she forgets about them,</b>

200
00:12:51,857 --> 00:12:53,602
<b>it means she'd lost her brightest moments.</b>

201
00:12:53,897 --> 00:12:55,541
<b>So in the end, she...</b>

202
00:12:57,226 --> 00:12:58,411
<b>Go on.</b>

203
00:12:59,637 --> 00:13:01,107
<b>Please watch the movie to find out what happens.</b>

204
00:13:01,107 --> 00:13:04,107
<b>My gosh, that was great timing to stop.</b>

205
00:13:04,107 --> 00:13:05,637
<b>You're a pro.</b>

206
00:13:05,637 --> 00:13:08,046
<b>All right. Let me stop here for a moment then.</b>

207
00:13:08,046 --> 00:13:09,907
<b>Let's listen to a song.</b>

208
00:13:09,907 --> 00:13:12,716
<b>Ha Jin, you chose this song yourself.</b>

209
00:13:12,716 --> 00:13:14,787
<b>Yes, it's one of my favorite songs.</b>

210
00:13:14,787 --> 00:13:16,216
<b>The lyrics are beautiful.</b>

211
00:13:16,216 --> 00:13:17,417
<b>Great.</b>

212
00:13:17,417 --> 00:13:20,761
<b>Let's listen to "Two People" by Sung Si Kyung.</b>

213
00:14:12,537 --> 00:14:14,082
<b>You're early.</b>

214
00:14:14,546 --> 00:14:16,952
<b>Look at this. You ordered my coffee too.</b>

215
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:18,791
<b>I like you very much these days.</b>

216
00:14:19,816 --> 00:14:20,992
<b>You're doing very well.</b>

217
00:14:33,897 --> 00:14:35,702
<b>My favorite song is playing.</b>

218
00:14:36,226 --> 00:14:38,641
<b>I guess the owner of the cafe also likes this song.</b>

219
00:14:38,936 --> 00:14:40,271
<b>This cafe plays this song often.</b>

220
00:14:41,936 --> 00:14:43,836
<b>Right. Did I tell you?</b>

221
00:14:43,836 --> 00:14:46,781
<b>Ha Na was the one who introduced this song to me.</b>

222
00:14:47,206 --> 00:14:48,706
<b>She told me the lyrics were beautiful.</b>

223
00:14:48,706 --> 00:14:51,692
<b>For some time, she recited the lyrics as if they were a poem.</b>

224
00:14:53,446 --> 00:14:57,062
<b>I am still learning a lot</b>

225
00:14:57,716 --> 00:15:00,592
<b>And I'm still lacking in many ways</b>

226
00:15:01,257 --> 00:15:06,972
<b>But I will always stay by your side</b>

227
00:15:07,867 --> 00:15:13,641
<b>Even if we get lost in the dark</b>

228
00:15:14,306 --> 00:15:17,141
<b>The two of us</b>

229
00:15:17,637 --> 00:15:22,521
<b>Will become each other's light</b>

230
00:15:26,017 --> 00:15:27,887
<b>Ha Na is a terrible singer.</b>

231
00:15:27,887 --> 00:15:29,487
<b>She keeps saying she's not,</b>

232
00:15:29,487 --> 00:15:30,562
<b>but she is.</b>

233
00:15:31,887 --> 00:15:33,017
<b>Come to think of it,</b>

234
00:15:33,017 --> 00:15:35,261
<b>I've done a lot of things for the first time with Ha Na.</b>

235
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:38,301
<b>The two of us went to karaoke for the first time.</b>

236
00:15:38,556 --> 00:15:40,157
<b>And we drank alcohol for the first time together.</b>

237
00:15:40,157 --> 00:15:41,972
<b>We drank whiskey together, swam together,</b>

238
00:15:45,497 --> 00:15:46,742
<b>and went on a blind date together.</b>

239
00:15:48,436 --> 00:15:50,566
<b>You have a long way to go if you want to catch up...</b>

240
00:15:50,566 --> 00:15:52,212
<b>with our friendship.</b>

241
00:15:52,507 --> 00:15:53,881
<b>Work harder.</b>

242
00:15:54,706 --> 00:15:55,781
<b>Sure.</b>

243
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:08,462
<b>I hope we get to see her together next year.</b>

244
00:16:15,066 --> 00:16:16,541
<b>I think I've met...</b>

245
00:16:17,196 --> 00:16:18,612
<b>your friend, Ha Na.</b>

246
00:16:20,667 --> 00:16:23,682
<b>It took me a while to recognize her because her name changed.</b>

247
00:16:34,887 --> 00:16:36,647
<b>I'm sorry. I'm late.</b>

248
00:16:36,647 --> 00:16:38,192
<b>No, it's all right.</b>

249
00:16:43,287 --> 00:16:45,301
<b>I apologize for suddenly asking you to meet me.</b>

250
00:16:45,627 --> 00:16:47,501
<b>It really has been a long time.</b>

251
00:16:47,796 --> 00:16:51,041
<b>I don't think we've met after Seo Yeon's funeral.</b>

252
00:16:52,167 --> 00:16:54,712
<b>Yes, you're right.</b>

253
00:16:56,137 --> 00:16:58,682
<b>By the way, what is this about?</b>

254
00:17:00,676 --> 00:17:02,781
<b>I had a question...</b>

255
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:05,952
<b>about her friend, Ha Na.</b>

256
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:09,192
<b>Seo Yeon and Ha Jin were really close.</b>

257
00:17:09,716 --> 00:17:11,331
<b>You'd never met her before?</b>

258
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:13,732
<b>No,</b>

259
00:17:14,526 --> 00:17:16,261
<b>I had never met her.</b>

260
00:17:16,486 --> 00:17:19,372
<b>So you're right. Ha Jin is Ha Na.</b>

261
00:17:20,496 --> 00:17:21,942
<b>You know, when you're young,</b>

262
00:17:22,266 --> 00:17:25,071
<b>you change your friend's name for a nickname.</b>

263
00:17:25,837 --> 00:17:27,367
<b>Seo Yeon was Yeong.</b>

264
00:17:27,367 --> 00:17:28,912
<b>And Ha Jin was Ha Na.</b>

265
00:17:29,206 --> 00:17:31,152
<b>That's how they used to call each other.</b>

266
00:17:51,057 --> 00:17:52,827
<b>You're not nervous at all.</b>

267
00:17:52,827 --> 00:17:54,026
<b>You're good with words too.</b>

268
00:17:54,026 --> 00:17:57,127
<b>Gosh, no. You made me feel very comfortable here.</b>

269
00:17:57,127 --> 00:17:58,672
<b>- Excuse me. - Okay.</b>

270
00:18:05,673 --> 00:18:10,673


271
00:18:18,516 --> 00:18:19,591
<b>What?</b>

272
00:18:21,456 --> 00:18:22,662
<b>Where did he go?</b>

273
00:18:25,297 --> 00:18:28,341
<b>My gosh, a radio show is more exhausting than I thought.</b>

274
00:18:30,996 --> 00:18:32,242
<b>What are you thinking?</b>

275
00:18:32,496 --> 00:18:33,966
<b>I need to go upstairs for a second.</b>

276
00:18:33,966 --> 00:18:36,067
<b>Go where? To the newsroom?</b>

277
00:18:36,067 --> 00:18:38,712
<b>Yes. I definitely saw Jeong Hoon earlier.</b>

278
00:18:39,107 --> 00:18:41,476
<b>Ha Jin, no one likes it when you barge into their offices...</b>

279
00:18:41,476 --> 00:18:42,807
<b>without an appointment.</b>

280
00:18:42,807 --> 00:18:45,147
<b>This is why people say they get sick of you.</b>

281
00:18:45,147 --> 00:18:47,251
<b>No, that can't be true.</b>

282
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:48,446
<b>I'm so sick of you.</b>

283
00:18:48,446 --> 00:18:50,387
<b>Wait. Hello.</b>

284
00:18:50,387 --> 00:18:51,716
<b>Okay. Thank you.</b>

285
00:18:51,716 --> 00:18:53,587
<b>What? This is Reporter Jo Il Kwon.</b>

286
00:18:53,587 --> 00:18:55,887
<b>- Hello. It's been a while. - Hi.</b>

287
00:18:55,887 --> 00:18:57,897
<b>Don't be like that. It's Reporter Jo.</b>

288
00:18:57,897 --> 00:19:00,402
<b>I see. I thought he was your fan or something.</b>

289
00:19:00,627 --> 00:19:03,202
<b>But which program do you work for?</b>

290
00:19:03,567 --> 00:19:04,696
<b>"News Live".</b>

291
00:19:04,696 --> 00:19:06,167
<b>You and I talked on the phone. And before the interview,</b>

292
00:19:06,167 --> 00:19:08,206
<b>I even said hello to you. Do you not remember me?</b>

293
00:19:08,206 --> 00:19:11,176
<b>I'm sorry. I'm usually good at remembering people's faces.</b>

294
00:19:11,176 --> 00:19:12,907
<b>- But you... - What about me?</b>

295
00:19:12,907 --> 00:19:14,407
<b>That's a common face you have.</b>

296
00:19:14,407 --> 00:19:16,176
<b>I do? No way.</b>

297
00:19:16,176 --> 00:19:18,617
<b>A lot of people tell me I have unique looks.</b>

298
00:19:18,617 --> 00:19:21,291
<b>I see. Well, I see.</b>

299
00:19:22,587 --> 00:19:24,456
<b>Is Jeong Hoon in the office?</b>

300
00:19:24,456 --> 00:19:26,692
<b>No, he stepped out.</b>

301
00:19:26,956 --> 00:19:28,761
<b>I see. Really?</b>

302
00:19:31,397 --> 00:19:33,632
<b>- Doctor. - Yes?</b>

303
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:35,242
<b>You have a visitor.</b>

304
00:19:35,266 --> 00:19:36,442
<b>A visitor?</b>

305
00:19:38,196 --> 00:19:39,372
<b>I'm here.</b>

306
00:19:40,337 --> 00:19:41,966
<b>You should have just come in.</b>

307
00:19:41,966 --> 00:19:44,236
<b>I must go through the proper channels.</b>

308
00:19:44,236 --> 00:19:47,581
<b>You're the director of the biggest psychiatric clinic in this area.</b>

309
00:19:48,807 --> 00:19:50,377
<b>Do you want something to drink?</b>

310
00:19:50,377 --> 00:19:52,347
<b>We're fine. You should all go home.</b>

311
00:19:52,347 --> 00:19:53,847
<b>Okay. Have a nice time.</b>

312
00:19:53,847 --> 00:19:54,922
<b>Thanks.</b>

313
00:19:55,617 --> 00:19:57,291
<b>You didn't answer any of my calls.</b>

314
00:19:57,587 --> 00:19:58,992
<b>What brings you here all of a sudden?</b>

315
00:20:03,857 --> 00:20:05,902
<b>I need to hear something from you.</b>

316
00:20:06,127 --> 00:20:07,331

<b>But get married late.</b>

630

<b>Don't forget that I'm always cheering for you.</b>

631
00:39:51,476 --> 00:39:52,551
<b>Okay.</b>

632
00:39:53,875 --> 00:39:57,460
<b>Yes? I guess you read the articles. That's right.</b>

633

<b>I bet 10 million people will watch the movie.</b>

<b>If she finds out that you two aren't dating,</b>

637
00:40:06,096 --> 00:40:07,796
<b>she'll probably collapse.</b>

638

<b>She'll be worried sick about people's finding out...</b>

<b>and collapse from high blood pressure.</b>

640

<b>You're right. Let's take it to our graves.</b>

641

<b>I've never seen her so happy.</b>

<b>Hold on.</b>

645
00:40:21,275 --> 00:40:23,346
<b>This means our movie may be up for more than two weeks.</b>

646

<b>You're right. We'll have to find out,</b>

<b>I doubt it's a flop.</b>

649

<b>Really?</b>

650
00:40:32,615 --> 00:40:36,501

<b>I'm talking about Jeong Hoon. His article is in the limelight.</b>

<b>You know what? I'm quite surprised...</b>

<b>to see Anchor Lee date an actress.</b>

671
00:41:44,485 --> 00:41:46,556
<b>When I first read the article, I wasn't sure.</b>

672
00:41:46,556 --> 00:41:48,865
<b>But seeing how he's keeping his silence, he must be dating her.</b>

673
00:41:48,865 --> 00:41:51,995
<b>Then, when Ha Jin came to our show for the interview,</b>

674
00:41:51,995 --> 00:41:53,796
<b>did they already know each other?</b>

675

<b>Gosh, isn't that obvious?</b>

676

<b>They were already dating even before the interview.</b>

677

<b>And that's probably why he messed up that day.</b>

<b>I'm not sure if they had a fight...</b>

<b>or they are head over heels for each other.</b>

680

<b>You're right. Anchor Lee was a bit different that day.</b>

681
00:42:07,915 --> 00:42:09,820
<b>Right. He did seem a bit off.</b>

682

<b>- Here's a revised script. - He's dating her in secret,</b>

<b>- That's right. - Thanks. Thank you.</b>

686

<b>You're dating her...</b>

<b>You must be happy.</b>

<b>Let me ask you a question.</b>

708
00:43:21,586 --> 00:43:24,155
<b>Why did you freeze during her interview?</b>

709
00:43:24,155 --> 00:43:25,726
<b>Were you not able to speak...</b>

710
00:43:25,726 --> 00:43:28,154
<b>because you couldn't be so mean to your girlfriend?</b>

711
00:43:28,155 --> 00:43:31,226
<b>Or were you not able to focus because things were going...</b>

712
00:43:31,226 --> 00:43:33,235
<b>so well between you two and she was sitting next to you?</b>

713
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:36,606
<b>Were you thinking about something else?</b>

714
00:43:36,606 --> 00:43:38,676
<b>She said you were sexy when you were critiquing others.</b>

715
00:43:38,676 --> 00:43:41,235
<b>What about you? What side of her do you find so sexy?</b>

716
00:43:41,235 --> 00:43:43,775
<b>Wait, you don't have to answer that. I think I already know.</b>

717
00:43:43,775 --> 00:43:47,490
<b>I saw her photos in the magazine. She has a fine body.</b>

718
00:43:49,785 --> 00:43:51,690
<b>I can't put up with this anymore.</b>

719
00:43:52,186 --> 00:43:54,891
<b>What? What will you do if you can't put up with it?</b>

720
00:44:10,936 --> 00:44:13,176
<b>What just happened? What's he doing?</b>

721
00:44:13,176 --> 00:44:16,046
<b>Come on, man. You went too far with this.</b>

722
00:44:16,046 --> 00:44:17,421
<b>I agree.</b>

723
00:44:19,915 --> 00:44:21,551
<b>What did I do?</b>

724
00:44:22,816 --> 00:44:25,216
<b>You know what? People make mistakes when they talk.</b>

725
00:44:25,216 --> 00:44:27,716
<b>That doesn't mean he can be rude to his senior like this!</b>

726
00:44:27,716 --> 00:44:28,956
<b>What will he do after he storms out?</b>

727
00:44:28,956 --> 00:44:31,901
<b>Will he come over here and punch me or something?</b>

728
00:44:40,566 --> 00:44:41,641
<b>Why are you here?</b>

729
00:44:41,665 --> 00:44:45,181
<b>Anchor Lee told me to inform you that he's using the restroom.</b>

730
00:44:45,405 --> 00:44:47,135
<b>- What? - He couldn't hold it anymore,</b>

731
00:44:47,135 --> 00:44:48,781
<b>so it was urgent.</b>

732
00:44:51,476 --> 00:44:53,590
<b>That jerk.</b>

733
00:45:00,885 --> 00:45:02,600
<b>It's about Ha Jin.</b>

734
00:45:03,926 --> 00:45:05,970
<b>What happens if she gets her memories back?</b>

735
00:45:07,956 --> 00:45:09,070
<b>She'll probably...</b>

736
00:45:10,196 --> 00:45:11,771
<b>be in a lot of pain.</b>

737
00:45:12,865 --> 00:45:15,340
<b>And things might get worse like before.</b>

738
00:45:19,106 --> 00:45:22,820
<b>Is it possible that she might never get her memories back?</b>

739
00:45:23,505 --> 00:45:24,580
<b>Yes.</b>

740
00:45:25,275 --> 00:45:28,051
<b>It's rare, but it happens for some people.</b>

741
00:45:28,375 --> 00:45:31,761
<b>Her memories aren't coming back even after a long time.</b>

742
00:45:33,086 --> 00:45:36,501
<b>But I still can't guarantee anything.</b>

743
00:45:38,956 --> 00:45:40,871
<b>A part of me is envious of her.</b>

744
00:45:41,456 --> 00:45:43,301
<b>And a part of me feels bad for her.</b>

745
00:45:49,735 --> 00:45:52,651
<b>I can't even imagine how she must be feeling.</b>

746
00:45:53,806 --> 00:45:56,450
<b>Living a life without precious memories.</b>

747
00:45:58,676 --> 00:46:00,651
<b>Which one of us is more pitiful?</b>

748
00:46:02,015 --> 00:46:04,690
<b>Me who can't forget my memories for the rest of my life?</b>

749
00:46:05,185 --> 00:46:07,661
<b>Or Ha Jin who had to forget her memories to live?</b>

750
00:46:12,662 --> 00:46:17,662


751

00:46:26,006 --> 00:46:27,510
<b>Are you sick?</b>

754
00:46:27,905 --> 00:46:30,405
<b>Like do you have the pink eyes, so you can't read my text?</b>

755
00:46:30,405 --> 00:46:33,720
<b>Or did you hurt your fingers, so you can't text me back?</b>

756
00:46:33,945 --> 00:46:36,561
<b>If it's neither, call me. It's important.</b>

757
00:46:41,516 --> 00:46:42,601
<b>It's mine.</b>

758
00:46:43,086 --> 00:46:44,786
<b>It's mine. Someone is calling me.</b>

<b>Yes, Ms. Park.</b>

<b>I see. She has an interview tomorrow? At what time?</b>

763
00:46:54,096 --> 00:46:55,381
<b>Okay.</b>

<b>What are you doing? Slapstick comedy?</b>

765

<b>I thought my phone was ringing.</b>

766

<b>You took yours earlier. Check your pocket.</b>

<b>Yes, right.</b>

768

<b>Yes. But he still hasn't gotten back to me.</b>

<b>Is he that busy?</b>

<b>Anchors on the news program are busy, right?</b>

<b>- But... - "But"?</b>

783
00:47:56,665 --> 00:47:58,266
<b>I'm curious and worried.</b>

784
00:47:58,266 --> 00:48:00,596
<b>What are you curious and worried about?</b>

785
00:48:00,596 --> 00:48:02,665
<b>Like when he froze on the news,</b>

786
00:48:02,665 --> 00:48:05,480
<b>there are times when it looks like he's somewhere else.</b>

787
00:48:06,236 --> 00:48:08,280
<b>He freezes and stops talking.</b>

788
00:48:09,506 --> 00:48:11,750
<b>I know that he's in front of me,</b>

789
00:48:12,346 --> 00:48:14,651
<b>but it looks like he's in some other universe.</b>

790
00:48:16,546 --> 00:48:18,720
<b>But whenever that happens, he looks sad.</b>

791
00:48:19,256 --> 00:48:20,960
<b>And it looks like he's in danger too.</b>

792
00:48:23,286 --> 00:48:25,901
<b>For some reason, if I don't hold onto him,</b>

793
00:48:26,625 --> 00:48:29,071
<b>he looks like he might disappear into thin air.</b>

794
00:48:32,596 --> 00:48:34,141
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

795
00:48:34,596 --> 00:48:36,280
<b>You won't get it.</b>

796
00:48:37,236 --> 00:48:39,975
<b>Oh, that. Silence is always harder than words.</b>

797
00:48:39,975 --> 00:48:42,010
<b>You were the one who told me that.</b>

798
00:48:43,875 --> 00:48:45,151
<b>Right, I did.</b>

799
00:48:46,975 --> 00:48:48,576
<b>It's pointless if it's one-sided.</b>

800
00:48:48,576 --> 00:48:50,290
<b>I doubt it's going to work out for you.</b>

801
00:48:50,385 --> 00:48:52,760
<b>He rejected you right away and ignored your calls and texts.</b>

802
00:48:52,885 --> 00:48:55,885
<b>It's all right. It's not over until it is.</b>

803
00:48:55,885 --> 00:48:58,685
<b>Gosh. This is not the right time to use that expression.</b>

804
00:48:58,685 --> 00:48:59,895
<b>It's a really cool saying.</b>

805
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:01,455
<b>Excuse me. Hey.</b>

806
00:49:01,455 --> 00:49:03,700
<b>The news must be starting now.</b>

807
00:49:04,895 --> 00:49:05,996
<b>What are you doing? Answer the phone.</b>

808
00:49:05,996 --> 00:49:07,871
<b>What? Is it mine?</b>

809
00:49:12,135 --> 00:49:13,210
<b>(Anchor Lee)</b>

810
00:49:14,375 --> 00:49:15,921
<b>(Anchor Lee)</b>

811
00:49:18,006 --> 00:49:19,546
<b>Anchor Lee, we're starting in 10 minutes.</b>

812
00:49:19,546 --> 00:49:21,115
<b>Give me a minute. I'll be right in.</b>

813
00:49:21,115 --> 00:49:22,190
<b>Okay.</b>

814
00:49:29,225 --> 00:49:30,500
<b>Hello?</b>

815
00:49:30,725 --> 00:49:32,030
<b>This is Lee Jeong Hoon.</b>

816
00:49:32,395 --> 00:49:35,000
<b>I'm sorry I didn't get back to you sooner. I was busy today.</b>

817
00:49:35,496 --> 00:49:37,865
<b>I see. You were very busy today.</b>

818
00:49:37,865 --> 00:49:38,970
<b>Hey, he was busy.</b>

819
00:49:39,266 --> 00:49:41,171
<b>It's all right. I understand.</b>

820
00:49:42,205 --> 00:49:44,311
<b>But what's so important that we needed to talk?</b>

821
00:49:45,036 --> 00:49:47,705
<b>Well, the situation has changed.</b>

822
00:49:47,705 --> 00:49:49,621
<b>It's a long conversation.</b>

823
00:49:49,776 --> 00:49:52,151
<b>I'd like to talk to you about the details in person.</b>

824
00:49:52,776 --> 00:49:55,220
<b>Sure. Let's meet then.</b>

825
00:49:55,486 --> 00:49:57,190
<b>I have something to tell you too.</b>

826
00:49:57,615 --> 00:49:59,185
<b>Are you free tomorrow?</b>

827
00:49:59,185 --> 00:50:00,431
<b>Tomorrow?</b>

828
00:50:02,655 --> 00:50:05,086
<b>How about today instead of tomorrow?</b>

829
00:50:05,086 --> 00:50:07,901
<b>After your news program. That will work for me.</b>

830
00:50:08,395 --> 00:50:10,566
<b>Okay, then. Where should we meet?</b>

831
00:50:10,566 --> 00:50:12,766
<b>Well... We failed at the Han River.</b>

832
00:50:12,766 --> 00:50:14,270
<b>Let's meet somewhere else.</b>

833
00:50:14,496 --> 00:50:16,135
<b>I know a cafe.</b>

834
00:50:16,135 --> 00:50:19,111
<b>I'll text you the address. I'll meet you there at 1am.</b>

835
00:50:19,675 --> 00:50:20,750
<b>Okay.</b>

836
00:50:21,405 --> 00:50:22,480
<b>Okay.</b>

837
00:50:27,316 --> 00:50:29,516
<b>What is this? He ignored you all day today.</b>

838
00:50:29,516 --> 00:50:30,645
<b>Did he agree to meet you?</b>

839
00:50:30,645 --> 00:50:33,316
<b>Yes. He said he needed to tell me something too.</b>

840
00:50:33,316 --> 00:50:34,516
<b>Like what?</b>

841
00:50:34,516 --> 00:50:37,000
<b>I don't know. What does he want to talk about?</b>

842
00:50:37,185 --> 00:50:39,831
<b>I doubt that he will agree to your plan.</b>

843
00:50:40,125 --> 00:50:41,526
<b>If you ask him to continue...</b>

844
00:50:41,526 --> 00:50:43,571
<b>this fake relationship for two months, he'll be appalled.</b>

845
00:50:44,225 --> 00:50:47,371
<b>- He won't be appalled. - I don't think so.</b>

846
00:50:49,365 --> 00:50:50,665
<b>Hello, everyone.</b>

847
00:50:50,665 --> 00:50:53,411
<b>Let us begin "Lee Jeong Hoon's News Live".</b>

848
00:50:54,276 --> 00:50:56,651
<b>But what does he want to say to me?</b>

849
00:50:57,905 --> 00:51:00,050
<b>Is it something good or bad?</b>

850
00:51:01,115 --> 00:51:03,161
<b>I don't think you should be sitting around.</b>

851
00:51:03,415 --> 00:51:04,486
<b>Are you going to see him like that?</b>

852
00:51:04,486 --> 00:51:06,516
<b>What? No!</b>

853
00:51:06,516 --> 00:51:09,000
<b>You have to be ready in 40 minutes to get there in time.</b>

854
00:51:09,056 --> 00:51:10,230
<b>Gosh, this is bad.</b>

855
00:51:12,395 --> 00:51:13,700
<b>I won't go if you run too late.</b>

856
00:51:15,725 --> 00:51:16,901
<b>Hey!</b>

857
00:51:18,395 --> 00:51:19,911
<b>Which one do you think looks better?</b>

858
00:51:20,435 --> 00:51:21,571
<b>Can you see?</b>

859
00:51:23,106 --> 00:51:26,010
<b>- The silver dress. - The silver one? Okay.</b>

860
00:51:34,776 --> 00:51:37,690
<b>If you're going to wear whatever you want, why did you ask me?</b>

861
00:51:38,316 --> 00:51:40,556
<b>No, you were very helpful.</b>

862
00:51:40,556 --> 00:51:43,401
<b>I left out everything you liked, and it ended in no time.</b>

863
00:52:01,106 --> 00:52:04,480
<b>Hey, he's here already. I'm getting off.</b>

864
00:52:04,905 --> 00:52:06,345
<b>Call me when you're done talking.</b>

865
00:52:06,346 --> 00:52:07,450
<b>Okay.</b>

866
00:52:17,786 --> 00:52:19,171
<b>You got here early.</b>

867
00:52:19,925 --> 00:52:21,200
<b>I just got here.</b>

868
00:52:21,425 --> 00:52:23,296
<b>I enjoyed the news today.</b>

869
00:52:23,296 --> 00:52:25,641
<b>Although I only caught half of it trying to get ready to go out.</b>

870
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:29,341
<b>Your tie looked great on you.</b>

871
00:52:29,465 --> 00:52:30,641
<b>Really?</b>

872
00:52:31,205 --> 00:52:32,480
<b>I'm glad.</b>

873
00:52:33,606 --> 00:52:35,780
<b>Let's go inside. It's chilly.</b>

874
00:52:37,346 --> 00:52:38,480
<b>It's right here.</b>

875
00:52:48,685 --> 00:52:49,901
<b>No one is here.</b>

876
00:52:50,225 --> 00:52:52,856
<b>Yes, it's not her business hour,</b>

877
00:52:52,856 --> 00:52:54,601
<b>but I asked her for a favor.</b>

878
00:52:55,195 --> 00:52:58,200
<b>I'm close to the owner here, so I came here from time to time.</b>

879
00:52:58,465 --> 00:52:59,970
<b>Our table is on the second floor.</b>

880
00:53:07,675 --> 00:53:09,581
<b>Isn't the night view here awfully pretty?</b>

881
00:53:09,776 --> 00:53:12,891
<b>I came here often to see this with Ha Kyung and...</b>

882
00:53:13,145 --> 00:53:14,250
<b>Goodness.</b>

883
00:53:29,496 --> 00:53:30,841
<b>Be careful.</b>

884
00:53:31,526 --> 00:53:33,841
<b>I should never let my guard down when I'm with you.</b>

885
00:53:35,266 --> 00:53:37,811
<b>Walk up carefully. Don't fall down again.</b>

886
00:53:39,806 --> 00:53:40,881
<b>Okay.</b>

887
00:53:54,516 --> 00:53:56,230
<b>Do you know who Jung Seo Yeon is?</b>

888
00:53:58,086 --> 00:54:00,931
<b>Jeong Hoon asked yesterday whether I knew her or not.</b>

889
00:54:01,856 --> 00:54:03,601
<b>Gosh, no way.</b>

890
00:54:05,125 --> 00:54:06,871
<b>I'm sure it's someone with the same name.</b>

891
00:54:07,566 --> 00:54:09,811
<b>It's not like she was the only one with that name.</b>

892
00:54:15,106 --> 00:54:16,905
<b>I didn't want to interrupt you in the middle of the news,</b>

893
00:54:16,905 --> 00:54:19,250
<b>so I ordered everything myself. Is that all right?</b>

894
00:54:19,516 --> 00:54:20,846
<b>It's a cocktail.</b>

895
00:54:20,846 --> 00:54:22,415
<b>Yours is a virgin.</b>

896
00:54:22,415 --> 00:54:24,520
<b>You have to drive, and you don't like alcohol.</b>

897
00:54:34,195 --> 00:54:36,141
<b>I think this is yours.</b>

898
00:54:44,036 --> 00:54:46,780
<b>Yes, this is the one without alcohol.</b>

899
00:54:48,036 --> 00:54:50,220
<b>See that? I can never let my guard down.</b>

900
00:54:51,375 --> 00:54:52,591
<b>You're right.</b>

901
00:54:54,375 --> 00:54:55,520
<b>It's good.</b>

902
00:54:56,316 --> 00:54:58,490
<b>And I like the ambiance here.</b>

903
00:55:00,115 --> 00:55:01,190
<b>Right?</b>

904
00:55:01,586 --> 00:55:04,661
<b>One second. It's way too pretty.</b>

905
00:55:04,725 --> 00:55:06,500
<b>May I take some pictures and come back?</b>

906
00:55:06,925 --> 00:55:09,665
<b>I'll leave you out of the picture, and I won't post it either.</b>

907
00:55:09,665 --> 00:55:12,270
<b>I just want to keep it for myself. Is that okay?</b>

908
00:55:12,996 --> 00:55:14,111
<b>Sure.</b>

909
00:55:14,496 --> 00:55:15,710
<b>I'll be back soon.</b>

910
00:55:54,036 --> 00:55:57,980
<b>Don't people like you usually hate taking pictures?</b>

911
00:55:58,576 --> 00:56:01,651
<b>You already get a lot of pictures taken as a celebrity.</b>

912
00:56:02,076 --> 00:56:05,020
<b>You're right. Some people hate taking pictures.</b>

913
00:56:06,155 --> 00:56:07,831
<b>But I like it.</b>

914
00:56:08,356 --> 00:56:10,730
<b>It's harder to forget if I have these pictures.</b>

915
00:56:14,356 --> 00:56:16,895
<b>I don't have a good memory,</b>

916
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:18,740
<b>so I forget a lot of things.</b>

917
00:56:20,596 --> 00:56:23,411
<b>But if you take pictures, these memories don't disappear.</b>

918
00:56:24,465 --> 00:56:27,050
<b>And I won't have to be nervous about not remembering.</b>

919
00:56:28,276 --> 00:56:30,050
<b>When I look at these pictures later,</b>

920
00:56:30,945 --> 00:56:32,891
<b>I feel reassured that...</b>

921
00:56:33,246 --> 00:56:36,290
<b>I've been living very well and diligently.</b>

922
00:56:41,455 --> 00:56:42,561
<b>Why?</b>

923
00:56:43,185 --> 00:56:44,861
<b>Did I seem weird again?</b>

924
00:56:45,685 --> 00:56:49,500
<b>No, come to think about it, I can see why you do that.</b>

925
00:56:50,665 --> 00:56:52,540
<b>I have too good of a memory.</b>

926
00:56:54,236 --> 00:56:55,411
<b>What is this?</b>

927
00:56:56,205 --> 00:56:57,841
<b>Are you showing off?</b>

928
00:57:00,036 --> 00:57:01,980
<b>Anyway, what's this important thing you have to say?</b>

929
00:57:02,675 --> 00:57:06,321
<b>Right, our prediction was completely wrong.</b>

930
00:57:06,475 --> 00:57:09,561
<b>I think my movie will become a huge hit.</b>

931
00:57:10,086 --> 00:57:13,015
<b>We held a press preview today, and everyone loved it.</b>

932
00:57:13,016 --> 00:57:14,931
<b>And it's the number one on ticket sales too.</b>

933
00:57:15,955 --> 00:57:16,986
<b>Really?</b>

934
00:57:16,986 --> 00:57:19,796
<b>I doubt it'll be taken off after just two weeks,</b>

935
00:57:19,796 --> 00:57:20,970
<b>so our contract...</b>

936
00:57:22,725 --> 00:57:26,036
<b>I mean, it's not really a contract, per se,</b>

937
00:57:26,036 --> 00:57:28,371
<b>but I thought we should extend this period.</b>

938
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:32,240
<b>How much longer?</b>

939
00:57:33,236 --> 00:57:34,681
<b>At least two months.</b>

940
00:57:36,546 --> 00:57:37,950
<b>Or maybe longer.</b>

941
00:57:40,945 --> 00:57:45,121
<b>Well, you know, it might be a huge failure,</b>

942
00:57:45,346 --> 00:57:46,816
<b>but if I ruin its success...</b>

943
00:57:46,816 --> 00:57:49,190
<b>because of my breakup news,</b>

944
00:57:49,356 --> 00:57:52,161
<b>I'd feel too bad for everyone who worked hard.</b>

945
00:57:56,395 --> 00:57:57,500
<b>Okay.</b>

946
00:57:58,225 --> 00:58:00,240
<b>Let's do as you'd like.</b>

947
00:58:02,336 --> 00:58:03,510
<b>Really?</b>

948
00:58:05,006 --> 00:58:07,250
<b>I don't care about the period. You can do that.</b>

949
00:58:11,246 --> 00:58:12,321
<b>Okay.</b>

950
00:58:19,685 --> 00:58:22,661
<b>By the way, is something going on?</b>

951
00:58:23,486 --> 00:58:24,486
<b>Like what?</b>

952
00:58:24,486 --> 00:58:27,171
<b>You seem a little different.</b>

953
00:58:28,655 --> 00:58:33,040
<b>How can I put this? You seem nicer and gentler...</b>

954
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:36,181
<b>as if you had a change of mind.</b>

955
00:58:37,536 --> 00:58:40,210
<b>To be frank, you were awfully cold to me.</b>

956
00:58:40,935 --> 00:58:42,151
<b>What did you say?</b>

957
00:58:42,675 --> 00:58:43,780
<b>Yes, right.</b>

958
00:58:43,975 --> 00:58:47,621
<b>You hated someone who is reckless, thoughtless, and inconsiderate.</b>

959
00:58:49,316 --> 00:58:51,091
<b>You're a good person.</b>

960
00:58:55,486 --> 00:58:57,401
<b>I want you to always be happy.</b>

961
00:59:00,526 --> 00:59:01,800
<b>I mean it.</b>

962
00:59:10,536 --> 00:59:12,381
<b>You mean that in a good way, right?</b>

963
00:59:13,106 --> 00:59:14,581
<b>But it sounds like...</b>

964
00:59:15,576 --> 00:59:18,250
<b>you'll never see me again.</b>

965
00:59:19,816 --> 00:59:21,821
<b>Yes, you're right.</b>

966
00:59:23,016 --> 00:59:25,460
<b>I hope you will never contact me or ask me to meet...</b>

967
00:59:26,655 --> 00:59:28,391
<b>ever again.</b>

968
00:59:29,685 --> 00:59:31,760
<b>That's why I wanted to see you.</b>

969
00:59:35,655 --> 00:59:38,901
<b>You just said you didn't care how long it lasts,</b>

970
00:59:39,365 --> 00:59:41,171
<b>that I can do whatever I want.</b>

971
00:59:41,435 --> 00:59:44,881
<b>That doesn't matter. It's all fake anyway.</b>

972
00:59:46,705 --> 00:59:48,851
<b>So you wanted to say...</b>

973
00:59:49,475 --> 00:59:51,921
<b>you never want to meet me again?</b>

974
00:59:53,415 --> 00:59:54,520
<b>Yes.</b>

975
01:00:01,756 --> 01:00:03,401
<b>What's the reason?</b>

976
01:00:06,455 --> 01:00:08,030
<b>You and I were...</b>

977
01:00:08,796 --> 01:00:11,700
<b>strangers until a few days ago.</b>

978
01:00:13,165 --> 01:00:16,841
<b>We're just going back to our places.</b>

979
01:00:17,806 --> 01:00:19,010
<b>It's simple.</b>

980
01:00:20,975 --> 01:00:22,450
<b>"It's simple"?</b>

981
01:00:23,606 --> 01:00:26,851
<b>I'm responsible for playing along with the love scandal,</b>

982
01:00:27,175 --> 01:00:28,520
<b>so you can release...</b>

983
01:00:29,145 --> 01:00:32,290
<b>the news of our breakup when your movie stops playing.</b>

984
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:46,811
<b>Let's go.</b>

985
01:01:56,365 --> 01:01:58,181
<b>(We thank Kim Ea Na for her special appearance.)</b>

986
01:02:13,256 --> 01:02:15,516
<b>(Find Me in Your Memory)</b>

987
01:02:15,516 --> 01:02:17,455
<b>I ended it well with Ha Jin.</b>

988
01:02:17,455 --> 01:02:19,385
<b>I'm sure the wounds will become dull over time.</b>

989
01:02:19,385 --> 01:02:20,695
<b>Don't be too concerned.</b>

990
01:02:20,695 --> 01:02:23,096
<b>I can never tell what he's like.</b>

991
01:02:23,096 --> 01:02:26,195
<b>Did you never think of me once ever since that time?</b>

992
01:02:26,195 --> 01:02:27,865
<b>I hope you'll be happier...</b>

993
01:02:27,865 --> 01:02:30,935
<b>in the times to come compared to the times of the past.</b>

994
01:02:30,935 --> 01:02:33,506
<b>There's no way he can live a normal life.</b>

995
01:02:33,506 --> 01:02:34,705
<b>Someone who's suspicious?</b>

996
01:02:34,705 --> 01:02:36,205
<b>Have you ever received...</b>

997
01:02:36,205 --> 01:02:38,276
<b>any weird photos or threatening letters?</b>

998
01:02:38,276 --> 01:02:40,290
<b>We ran into each other quite a few times.</b>

999
01:02:40,445 --> 01:02:41,720
<b>Don't you know me?</b>
