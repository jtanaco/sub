4
00:00:56,696 --> 00:00:58,156
<b>What happened, Father?</b>

5
00:00:59,796 --> 00:01:01,527
<b>Why is Mother's picture up there?</b>

6
00:01:04,167 --> 00:01:06,137
<b>She was fine until yesterday. Why...</b>

7
00:01:07,537 --> 00:01:09,307
<b>Say something, Father.</b>

8
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:13,347
<b>What happened to her?</b>

9
00:01:17,976 --> 00:01:20,517
<b>How did you know
you'll find her here?</b>

10
00:01:21,586 --> 00:01:22,717
<b>What did you say?</b>

11
00:01:23,717 --> 00:01:25,487
<b>Why didn't you call me?</b>

12
00:01:26,026 --> 00:01:27,657
<b>Why do I have to...</b>

13
00:01:28,657 --> 00:01:31,597
<b>find out about this right here
in this way?</b>

14
00:01:31,957 --> 00:01:33,927
<b>What did you hide and not tell me...</b>

15
00:01:34,827 --> 00:01:37,967
<b>about Mother's condition
to this day? What is it?</b>

16
00:01:39,467 --> 00:01:41,836
<b>When we found it out
three months ago,</b>

17
00:01:42,877 --> 00:01:46,106
<b>she was already in her
last stage of cancer.</b>

18
00:01:48,347 --> 00:01:51,377
<b>Thankfully, she was able
to receive chemotherapy,</b>

19
00:01:51,677 --> 00:01:53,646
<b>so we had set a surgery date.</b>

20
00:01:54,987 --> 00:01:56,916
<b>The success rate was low,</b>

21
00:01:57,487 --> 00:01:59,127
<b>but your mom...</b>

22
00:01:59,856 --> 00:02:01,487
<b>wanted to fight until the end.</b>

23
00:02:01,627 --> 00:02:02,657
<b>And...</b>

24
00:02:03,396 --> 00:02:06,267
<b>you hadn't told your own son
about that?</b>

25
00:02:08,026 --> 00:02:09,166
<b>You should've...</b>

26
00:02:10,866 --> 00:02:14,467
<b>You should've told me
about this sooner!</b>

27
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:20,407
<b>How could you not let me
say my last goodbye?</b>

28
00:02:22,206 --> 00:02:24,277
<b>This was what she wanted.</b>

29
00:02:26,347 --> 00:02:27,386
<b>It was all for you.</b>

30
00:02:28,347 --> 00:02:29,416
<b>She...</b>

31
00:02:30,256 --> 00:02:31,956
<b>pitied you.</b>

32
00:02:36,196 --> 00:02:37,597
<b>She's not doing too well.</b>

33
00:02:38,196 --> 00:02:39,926
<b>Her neutrophil count is very low,</b>

34
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:41,696
<b>so the cancer cells are spreading.</b>

35
00:02:42,027 --> 00:02:45,166
<b>I think it's best
that you prepare for the worst.</b>

36

<b>It is time.</b>

37
00:02:59,886 --> 00:03:01,717
<b>We should tell Jeong Hoon.</b>

38
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:03,016
<b>No.</b>

39
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:06,627
<b>No, honey.</b>

<b>Stop being stubborn.</b>

41

<b>Don't you miss him?</b>

42
00:03:11,127 --> 00:03:14,127
<b>You should see him

43
00:03:15,196 --> 00:03:16,766
<b>I'm not going to see him.</b>

44
00:03:18,636 --> 00:03:20,606
<b>I'm not going to let him see me.</b>

45
00:03:22,606 --> 00:03:24,037
<b>Don't show my body...</b>

46
00:03:25,437 --> 00:03:29,217
<b>to him.</b>

47
00:03:29,217 --> 00:03:32,687
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

48
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:36,187
<b>You know very well.</b>

49
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:38,916
<b>Our son...</b>

50
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:42,386
<b>can't forget anything.</b>

51

<b>I can't let him...</b>

52
00:03:48,067 --> 00:03:51,296
<b>go to bed every night,</b>

53
00:03:52,037 --> 00:03:54,506
<b>thinking about
my cold, lifeless body.</b>

54
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:58,277
<b>After some time,</b>

55
00:03:59,277 --> 00:04:01,147
<b>you will be able...</b>

56
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:04,277
<b>to forget that image.</b>

57
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:08,516
<b>But...</b>

58
00:04:10,157 --> 00:04:11,687
<b>that's not the case for him.</b>

59
00:04:16,527 --> 00:04:17,997
<b>That poor kid...</b>

60
00:04:21,866 --> 00:04:23,666
<b>won't forget it.</b>

61
00:04:24,467 --> 00:04:26,507
<b>I pity him.</b>

62
00:04:29,037 --> 00:04:31,907
<b>So please...</b>

63
00:04:33,347 --> 00:04:34,476
<b>Please...</b>

64
00:04:35,947 --> 00:04:37,847
<b>listen to me.</b>

65
00:04:41,587 --> 00:04:43,387
<b>I beg you.</b>

66
00:04:52,796 --> 00:04:53,996
<b>So...</b>

67
00:04:55,397 --> 00:04:57,936
<b>let's just let her go.</b>

68
00:05:01,566 --> 00:05:04,176

<b>Why are you out here alone?</b>

72
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:55,587
<b>Hello.</b>

73

<b>Hello.</b>

<b>I brought Jeong Hoon's clothes.

80

<b>Can you tell me?</b>

<b>My friends...</b>

<b>don't want to play with me.</b>

<b>They said I'm weird.</b>

<b>They said I'm like an alien.</b>

<b>Jeong Hoon.</b>

87

<b>Being able to remember more

<b>is an amazing talent.</b>

<b>Most people tend to forget
important things.</b>

90
00:07:19,376 --> 00:07:21,546
<b>That's why they make mistakes...</b>

91
00:07:21,546 --> 00:07:23,777
<b>and hurt each other.</b>

92
00:07:25,217 --> 00:07:28,717
<b>But since you remember
every single thing,</b>

93
00:07:28,717 --> 00:07:32,157
<b>you will neither make mistakes
nor hurt others.</b>

94
00:07:34,327 --> 00:07:36,397
<b>You mean like how
you were disappointed in Dad...</b>

95

<b>because he forgot
that it was your birthday?</b>

<b>Exactly.</b>

97
00:07:41,267 --> 00:07:43,837
<b>Then it's a good thing...</b>

98
00:07:44,796 --> 00:07:45,967
<b>to have a good memory.</b>

99
00:07:45,967 --> 00:07:47,467
<b>Of course.</b>

100
00:07:48,207 --> 00:07:51,007
<b>I'm so jealous of you.</b>

101
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:54,746
<b>You are...</b>

102
00:07:55,746 --> 00:07:58,816
<b>the most special person

<b>It's okay.</b>

111

<b>Did you not know either?</b>

113
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:29,537
<b>No.</b>

114
00:10:34,037 --> 00:10:35,566
<b>How could she pass away

115
00:10:36,607 --> 00:10:38,706
<b>She had stomach cancer...</b>

116
00:10:38,706 --> 00:10:41,277
<b>but hid it from Jeong Hoon

117
00:10:42,046 --> 00:10:43,446
<b>Did you speak with him?</b>

118
00:10:43,446 --> 00:10:46,487
<b>No, but I spoke with his friend.</b>

<b>Of course.</b>

124
00:10:56,696 --> 00:10:58,127
<b>You can go first.</b>

125
00:10:58,127 --> 00:10:59,867
<b>Let me know if something happens.</b>

<b>Has he been following us

132
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:43,737
<b>Come on, you shouldn't

133
00:12:43,737 --> 00:12:46,096
<b>The look on Ha Jin's face

<b>What are you doing?</b>

135
00:12:47,836 --> 00:12:49,907
<b>I mean, I still have work to do.</b>

136
00:12:49,907 --> 00:12:51,507
<b>I should get a photo

<b>Please leave when I ask nicely.</b>

138
00:12:52,936 --> 00:12:54,846
<b>Come on, don't be like that.
Where is that?</b>

139
00:12:55,176 --> 00:12:57,846
<b>I'm here to pay my respect too.</b>

140
00:12:59,477 --> 00:13:02,316
<b>My gosh, you must have cried a lot.</b>

141
00:13:02,316 --> 00:13:04,186
<b>Your eyes are all puffy.</b>

142
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:08,326
<b>I guess you and Anchor Lee
must have gotten very close.</b>

143
00:13:08,326 --> 00:13:10,056
<b>I thought
you two wouldn't last long.</b>

144
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:11,997
<b>Your relationship is
lasting longer than I thought.</b>

145
00:13:11,997 --> 00:13:13,527
<b>That's enough, Reporter Park.</b>

146
00:13:13,527 --> 00:13:15,527
<b>Seeing how you came
to his mother's funeral,</b>

147

<b>- does it mean the families met...
- Hey.</b>

148
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:19,596
<b>Do you want to do this even

<b>It's my job, you know.</b>

150

<b>Hey, you should leave.</b>

151
00:13:23,137 --> 00:13:25,037
<b>- Let go of me. Let go.
- Please leave.</b>

152

<b>Il Kwon, are you out of your mind?

<b>What are you doing? Hold on.</b>

158

<b>Be quiet. Quiet down.</b>

159
00:13:37,887 --> 00:13:39,987
<b>My gosh. Come here.
Stand right here.</b>

160

<b>- Attention.

<b>- No.
- As if.</b>

<b>He acts all classy and all,</b>

<b>No way. This isn't enough

<b>If that was my goal, I would've done

<b>Well, that's...</b>

207
00:15:34,107 --> 00:15:36,706
<b>Did you hear anything

00:15:58,826 --> 00:16:00,466

<b>Why didn't you go home?
Why are you sitting out here?</b>

<b>- Are you sick?
- Do I look slimmer?</b>

225
00:17:28,886 --> 00:17:32,586

227
00:17:34,187 --> 00:17:37,356
<b>I'm totally fine.</b>

228
00:17:39,027 --> 00:17:40,096
<b>Later.</b>

229
00:17:40,967 --> 00:17:42,796

230
00:17:43,697 --> 00:17:46,967

<b>- So...
- Can you fix my condition?</b>

239

<b>You said you'll do everything.</b>

240

<b>You can't, can you?</b>

242
00:18:19,197 --> 00:18:21,007
<b>Then, leave me alone.</b>

243
00:18:26,806 --> 00:18:28,507
<b>You must be exhausted too.</b>

244
00:18:28,777 --> 00:18:30,247
<b>Let's go home and rest.</b>

245

00:21:34,767 --> 00:21:36,896
<b>It's natural for him to grieve now.</b>

316
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,396
<b>His mother passed away.</b>

317
00:21:38,396 --> 00:21:39,997
<b>Keep an eye on him.</b>

318
00:21:40,437 --> 00:21:42,606
<b>You never know
where he'll cause trouble.</b>

319
00:21:42,906 --> 00:21:44,876
<b>Keep a close watch over him.</b>

320
00:21:45,336 --> 00:21:47,747
<b>"Keep a close watch"?
Why should I keep a watch on him?</b>

321
00:21:47,747 --> 00:21:50,846
<b>If you don't want to use that word,
call it "looking after" or whatever.</b>

322
00:21:50,846 --> 00:21:52,846
<b>There's no time
for wordplay right now.</b>

323
00:21:53,247 --> 00:21:54,646
<b>Honey.</b>

324
00:21:56,086 --> 00:21:58,457
<b>He was out of his mind
when his girlfriend died...</b>

325
00:21:58,457 --> 00:21:59,957
<b>eight years ago.</b>

326
00:22:00,556 --> 00:22:02,626
<b>And you also said
he'll be fine back then.</b>

327
00:22:02,626 --> 00:22:03,957
<b>But what happened?</b>

328
00:22:03,957 --> 00:22:06,896
<b>He took the wheel while he was
out of his mind and almost died.</b>

329
00:22:07,796 --> 00:22:09,227
<b>- That's...
- And you said you're his friend...</b>

330
00:22:09,227 --> 00:22:10,767
<b>before you're his doctor.</b>

331
00:22:11,066 --> 00:22:14,606
<b>Should a friend just sit and watch
while he slowly destroys himself?</b>

332
00:22:14,636 --> 00:22:17,677
<b>Dad, I'm sure he'll manage.</b>

333
00:22:19,106 --> 00:22:20,677
<b>Let me know if you can't do it.</b>

334
00:22:20,677 --> 00:22:22,677
<b>I'll find someone else
to watch over him.</b>

335
00:22:23,616 --> 00:22:25,616
<b>I can't
let Jeong Hoon get destroyed.</b>

336
00:22:25,947 --> 00:22:29,616
<b>Do you know how hard I tried to
let him function as a decent human?</b>

337
00:22:31,217 --> 00:22:32,316
<b>Let's eat.</b>

338
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:45,336
<b>You were home?</b>

339
00:22:45,767 --> 00:22:47,537
<b>I thought you were at the funeral.</b>

340
00:22:48,306 --> 00:22:50,507
<b>Hey, I just got home.</b>

341
00:22:52,207 --> 00:22:53,606
<b>How's Ha Jin?</b>

342
00:22:53,606 --> 00:22:56,477
<b>She must've been shocked to hear
Anchor Lee's mother passed.</b>

343
00:22:57,177 --> 00:22:58,417
<b>She's all right.</b>

344
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:03,046
<b>You received more of those pictures?</b>

345
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:07,027
<b>Yes. So Jeong Hoon had been
investigating this continuously,</b>

346
00:23:07,027 --> 00:23:09,727
<b>including Soo Chang
and other people he's suspicious of.</b>

347
00:23:09,787 --> 00:23:12,197
<b>"Other people he's suspicious of"?
Who are they?</b>

348
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:16,826
<b>This is about my sister.
I need to know.</b>

349
00:23:18,437 --> 00:23:21,906
<b>Well, Director Ji Hyun Geun
and her manager, Moon Chul.</b>

350
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:23,537
<b>Chul?</b>

351
00:23:24,477 --> 00:23:26,677
<b>I knew something was odd
about Director Ji,</b>

352
00:23:26,677 --> 00:23:27,947
<b>but why Chul?</b>

353
00:23:27,947 --> 00:23:30,816
<b>After all, he's one of
her closest associates.</b>

354
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:34,017
<b>Over 70 percent of stalkers are
known as acquaintances.</b>

355
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:37,287
<b>I'm so sorry about yesterday.</b>

356
00:23:37,787 --> 00:23:40,386
<b>I had to meet a friend
who lives far away.</b>

357
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:42,187
<b>I left as soon as possible,</b>

358
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:44,056
<b>but the traffic was
worse than I expected.</b>

359
00:23:44,326 --> 00:23:45,457
<b>It's okay.</b>

360
00:23:47,326 --> 00:23:49,267
<b>Anyway, why are you suddenly here?</b>

361
00:23:49,366 --> 00:23:52,167
<b>Oh, because of the outfit she wore
last week for that variety show.</b>

362
00:23:52,167 --> 00:23:54,136
<b>Eun Jeong said she has to
return it to the clothing sponsor,</b>

363
00:23:54,136 --> 00:23:55,406
<b>so she asked me to bring it.</b>

364
00:23:55,806 --> 00:23:58,207
<b>What outfit? I returned everything.</b>

365
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:00,477
<b>Really?</b>

366
00:24:01,247 --> 00:24:02,306
<b>That's odd.</b>

367
00:24:03,376 --> 00:24:06,076
<b>She must've been confused.
I'll check.</b>

368
00:24:07,717 --> 00:24:11,017
<b>Let us know before you come home.
Don't barge in like this.</b>

369
00:24:12,487 --> 00:24:13,886
<b>Yes, I understand.</b>

370
00:24:14,126 --> 00:24:16,927
<b>If you don't have anything else
you need me to do, I'll get going.</b>

371
00:24:17,227 --> 00:24:18,296
<b>Okay.</b>

372
00:24:32,937 --> 00:24:35,747
<b>No, how can this happen?</b>

373
00:24:35,747 --> 00:24:39,046
<b>How can this happen to her? No...</b>

374
00:24:52,626 --> 00:24:53,767
<b>Yes, Doctor Yoo.</b>

375
00:24:53,997 --> 00:24:57,096
<b>Did you go home safely? I had
no time to greet you when you came.</b>

376
00:24:58,636 --> 00:25:01,836
<b>Yes. How's Anchor Lee?</b>

377
00:25:03,007 --> 00:25:05,777
<b>It must be very tough for him.</b>

378
00:25:06,537 --> 00:25:08,546
<b>And it won't be easy
for him to get better.</b>

379
00:25:10,747 --> 00:25:13,517
<b>I don't even know
what I can say to comfort him.</b>

380
00:25:15,947 --> 00:25:17,156
<b>Time...</b>

381
00:25:18,757 --> 00:25:21,227
<b>can't help him either.</b>

382
00:25:29,596 --> 00:25:33,136
<b>(The late Seo Mi Hyun)</b>

383
00:26:29,826 --> 00:26:31,396
<b>He's doing that again.</b>

384
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:33,427
<b>- He's a clean freak.
- He's very clean.</b>

385
00:26:33,427 --> 00:26:35,126
<b>Why is he making a fuss?</b>

386
00:26:35,126 --> 00:26:36,896
<b>He's very clean, that's all.</b>

387
00:26:38,136 --> 00:26:42,106
<b>He's doing that again.
He must be awfully clean.</b>

388
00:26:42,106 --> 00:26:45,237
<b>Does he do this
as a part of his live news ritual?</b>

389
00:26:45,237 --> 00:26:49,046
<b>Goodness, let him be.
He said he's sensitive to dust.</b>

390
00:26:49,046 --> 00:26:50,306
<b>There's no dust in there.</b>

391
00:26:51,116 --> 00:26:52,747
<b>He's such a drama king.</b>

392
00:26:52,846 --> 00:26:55,717
<b>After all, Anchor Lee is the best,
isn't he?</b>

393
00:26:56,287 --> 00:26:59,917
<b>Wait, do you miss him already?</b>

394
00:26:59,917 --> 00:27:01,257
<b>- Me?
- Yes.</b>

395
00:27:01,257 --> 00:27:04,596
<b>Are you insane?
I just don't like him, that's all.</b>

396
00:27:04,596 --> 00:27:07,227
<b>I know he's just a fill-in,
but don't we have better anchors?</b>

397
00:27:07,227 --> 00:27:08,826
<b>Even I could do better than him.</b>

398
00:27:09,927 --> 00:27:10,967
<b>Chul Woong.</b>

399
00:27:11,437 --> 00:27:14,106
<b>I wanted to tell you this
since yesterday.</b>

400
00:27:14,306 --> 00:27:16,566
<b>Yes? What is it?</b>

401
00:27:16,566 --> 00:27:19,106
<b>You know how you count down
from three after the video?</b>

402
00:27:19,106 --> 00:27:21,046
<b>Can you stop doing that?</b>

403
00:27:22,277 --> 00:27:25,846
<b>Why? I do that to tell you
when you should begin to talk...</b>

404
00:27:25,846 --> 00:27:26,846
<b>so that you won't make a mistake.</b>

405
00:27:26,846 --> 00:27:29,017
<b>I can manage to go in
without you counting,</b>

406
00:27:29,017 --> 00:27:30,146
<b>so don't do it.</b>

407
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:33,717
<b>It's way too annoying.</b>

408
00:27:34,427 --> 00:27:35,987
<b>The tone of your voice...</b>

409
00:27:36,886 --> 00:27:38,027
<b>doesn't go well with me.</b>

410
00:27:38,027 --> 00:27:39,326
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

411
00:27:39,927 --> 00:27:42,467
<b>Who cares about
the tone of my voice?</b>

412
00:27:42,467 --> 00:27:43,697
<b>Anyway, do that for me.</b>

413
00:27:44,136 --> 00:27:47,237
<b>What was that?
What's so bad with my voice?</b>

414
00:27:48,237 --> 00:27:49,267
<b>Hey.</b>

415
00:27:49,737 --> 00:27:51,277
<b>Isn't that Anchor Lee?</b>

416
00:27:51,406 --> 00:27:54,346
<b>What are you talking about?
Are you lovesick?</b>

417
00:27:54,747 --> 00:27:56,247
<b>There's no way he's back already...</b>

418
00:27:57,947 --> 00:27:59,017
<b>Or there is.</b>

419
00:28:03,586 --> 00:28:05,417
<b>Why are you suddenly here?</b>

420
00:28:05,886 --> 00:28:08,326
<b>I thought today was
your mother's burial.</b>

421
00:28:08,487 --> 00:28:10,997
<b>Yes. Thanks for filling in for me.</b>

422
00:28:10,997 --> 00:28:12,427
<b>You may go now.</b>

423
00:28:12,757 --> 00:28:14,427
<b>Wait, what are you talking about?</b>

424
00:28:14,927 --> 00:28:17,767
<b>Can you bring the script to me?
I'll get ready.</b>

425
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:19,096
<b>What?</b>

426
00:28:47,326 --> 00:28:48,326
<b>Hey.</b>

427
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:51,497
<b>You were supposed to be away
until next week. Why are you back?</b>

428
00:28:51,497 --> 00:28:54,237
<b>I don't need to be away.
I'll begin again as of today.</b>

429
00:28:54,606 --> 00:28:56,336
<b>That's nonsense.</b>

430
00:28:56,336 --> 00:28:58,477
<b>You were at the funeral
for three whole days.</b>

431
00:28:58,477 --> 00:29:00,336
<b>You can't do the news
in that condition.</b>

432
00:29:00,677 --> 00:29:01,846
<b>I can do it.</b>

433
00:29:01,846 --> 00:29:03,346
<b>What's with you, man?</b>

434
00:29:08,017 --> 00:29:09,046
<b>Hey.</b>

435
00:29:09,987 --> 00:29:12,257
<b>Go. Go home!</b>

436
00:29:12,257 --> 00:29:14,126
<b>Lee Jeong Hoon, what is this?
Why are you here?</b>

437
00:29:14,126 --> 00:29:15,787
<b>He's out of his mind.</b>

438
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:18,497
<b>He suddenly barged in
and said he'll read the news.</b>

439
00:29:18,497 --> 00:29:19,527
<b>What?</b>

440
00:29:19,957 --> 00:29:21,427
<b>Let me do it, Director Choi.</b>

441
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:24,167
<b>How can you do the news?
You're burning up with fever!</b>

442
00:29:24,467 --> 00:29:25,967
<b>If you go on air like this,</b>

443
00:29:25,967 --> 00:29:28,537
<b>you'll collapse
before the second story.</b>

444
00:29:29,507 --> 00:29:30,937
<b>Will you give us a moment?</b>

445
00:29:39,316 --> 00:29:41,247
<b>What are you doing here?</b>

446
00:29:41,247 --> 00:29:42,517
<b>I can do it.</b>

447
00:29:44,017 --> 00:29:46,017
<b>You know that I have
enough time to remember the script.</b>

448
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:47,086
<b>No.</b>

449
00:29:47,727 --> 00:29:50,086
<b>You can't do the news
in this condition.</b>

450
00:29:50,257 --> 00:29:51,257
<b>Director Choi.</b>

451
00:29:51,257 --> 00:29:53,656
<b>Go home, get some rest,
and we'll talk again tomorrow.</b>

452
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:57,767
<b>No, you're coming with me
to the hospital.</b>

453
00:29:58,167 --> 00:29:59,866
<b>I need to put you on an IV.</b>

454
00:30:04,306 --> 00:30:06,007
<b>I have to do the news, Director.</b>

455
00:30:06,207 --> 00:30:09,507
<b>What is wrong with you?
Why are you so stubborn?</b>

456
00:30:11,846 --> 00:30:13,376
<b>It's what my mother wanted.</b>

457
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:16,487
<b>So I have to do the news.</b>

458
00:30:16,816 --> 00:30:17,957
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

459
00:30:18,787 --> 00:30:20,927
<b>I can't let you do the news
unless I'm 100 percent confident.</b>

460
00:30:22,156 --> 00:30:23,886
<b>I can't gamble with the news.</b>

461
00:30:24,527 --> 00:30:26,596
<b>You're taking a week off
no matter what.</b>

462
00:30:26,596 --> 00:30:27,596
<b>I'll call you.</b>

463
00:30:33,866 --> 00:30:35,606
<b>What will change
even if I take time off?</b>

464
00:30:39,007 --> 00:30:41,046

<b>(Anchor Lee)</b>

467
00:31:13,636 --> 00:31:16,177
<b>Ha Kyung, you got a call.</b>

468
00:31:18,346 --> 00:31:19,546
<b>It's Chul.</b>

469
00:31:21,976 --> 00:31:23,717
<b>- Hey.
- Ha Kyung.</b>

470
00:31:23,717 --> 00:31:25,717
<b>Why am I in charge of Se Min
all of a sudden?</b>

471
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:26,986
<b>I'm in charge of Ha Jin.</b>

472
00:31:27,347 --> 00:31:28,887
<b>Did I do something wrong?</b>

473
00:31:29,016 --> 00:31:30,516
<b>What do you mean?</b>

474
00:31:31,757 --> 00:31:32,757
<b>Hey.</b>

475
00:31:33,387 --> 00:31:35,327
<b>No, you didn't do anything wrong.</b>

476
00:31:35,327 --> 00:31:37,397
<b>The newbie seemed
very inexperienced,</b>

477
00:31:37,397 --> 00:31:38,696
<b>so we thought you could help him.</b>

478
00:31:38,696 --> 00:31:40,296
<b>Did Ms. Park not tell you?</b>

479
00:31:41,497 --> 00:31:43,166
<b>Yes, that's why.</b>

480
00:31:43,497 --> 00:31:44,766
<b>All right.</b>

481
00:31:44,766 --> 00:31:46,637
<b>Let's talk again later. Bye.</b>

482
00:31:47,436 --> 00:31:49,777
<b>What's going on?
Why haven't I heard about this?</b>

483
00:31:50,077 --> 00:31:51,277
<b>Well...</b>

484
00:31:51,946 --> 00:31:54,106
<b>I really wasn't trying to hide it
from you this time.</b>

485
00:31:54,106 --> 00:31:55,946
<b>I just didn't have the time
to tell you...</b>

486
00:31:55,946 --> 00:31:58,147
<b>because of what happened
to Anchor Lee. Don't misunderstand.</b>

487
00:31:58,347 --> 00:31:59,787
<b>Okay, I won't.</b>

488
00:31:59,787 --> 00:32:01,317
<b>So what's going on?</b>

489
00:32:02,856 --> 00:32:03,856
<b>Well...</b>

490
00:32:05,187 --> 00:32:07,157
<b>Anchor Lee received more photos
from your stalker.</b>

491
00:32:07,526 --> 00:32:09,297
<b>- What?
- So Anchor Lee was looking...</b>

492
00:32:09,297 --> 00:32:12,297
<b>into any suspicious people
around you.</b>

493
00:32:13,067 --> 00:32:14,326
<b>And who were they?</b>

494
00:32:14,326 --> 00:32:16,737
<b>Reporter Park Soo Chang,
Director Ji Hyun Geun,</b>

495
00:32:18,207 --> 00:32:19,336
<b>and Chul.</b>

496
00:32:20,166 --> 00:32:21,166
<b>"Chul"?</b>

497
00:32:31,216 --> 00:32:32,886
<b>- Hello.
- Oh, my.</b>

498
00:32:33,317 --> 00:32:35,856
<b>What a pleasant surprise
so early in the morning.</b>

499
00:32:35,856 --> 00:32:38,326
<b>I wanted to discuss something
with you.</b>

500
00:32:38,326 --> 00:32:40,627
<b>Sure. Sit down.</b>

501
00:32:40,627 --> 00:32:41,627
<b>Okay.</b>

502
00:32:46,496 --> 00:32:49,097
<b>Did you hear about my movie?</b>

503
00:32:49,097 --> 00:32:52,136
<b>Yes. It's a shame that
she'll be busy during that time.</b>

504
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:54,877
<b>Ha Jin was always eager
to work with you.</b>

505
00:32:54,877 --> 00:32:56,507
<b>I'm so disappointed.</b>

506
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:59,247
<b>Do you still feel the same way?</b>

507
00:32:59,247 --> 00:33:01,307
<b>Of course. No doubt about it.</b>

508
00:33:01,516 --> 00:33:03,317
<b>Then it's settled.</b>

509
00:33:03,446 --> 00:33:05,946
<b>- I'll adjust the schedule.
- Sorry?</b>

510
00:33:05,946 --> 00:33:08,516
<b>I've been wanting
to take a break lately.</b>

511
00:33:08,516 --> 00:33:12,456
<b>And the film company is generous
enough to let me have my way,</b>

512
00:33:12,456 --> 00:33:13,886
<b>so I'm in no rush.</b>

513
00:33:14,287 --> 00:33:16,696
<b>We'll start
after Ha Jin finishes her work.</b>

514
00:33:16,956 --> 00:33:18,326
<b>Well...</b>

515
00:33:18,326 --> 00:33:21,396
<b>Don't worry. We'll adjust
the conditions as you wish.</b>

516
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,567
<b>Are we done here?</b>

517
00:33:23,567 --> 00:33:27,606
<b>You see, it's not solely up to me.</b>

518
00:33:27,606 --> 00:33:28,907
<b>To be honest,</b>

519
00:33:29,606 --> 00:33:31,507
<b>I was disappointed in you.</b>

520
00:33:32,007 --> 00:33:34,916
<b>I told everyone,
including the reporters,</b>

521
00:33:34,916 --> 00:33:38,046
<b>that Ha Jin and I would be working
on the next movie together.</b>

522
00:33:38,946 --> 00:33:40,916
<b>But you decided to let her work
on that other drama...</b>

523
00:33:40,916 --> 00:33:43,157
<b>without discussing it with me.</b>

524
00:33:45,657 --> 00:33:48,326
<b>Don't you think I'd feel humiliated?</b>

525
00:34:04,176 --> 00:34:05,377
<b>Hello.</b>

526
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:07,476
<b>Since when has he been following us?</b>

527
00:34:08,076 --> 00:34:09,446
<b>I was curious about something.</b>

528
00:34:09,446 --> 00:34:11,646
<b>- What's Anchor Lee up to nowadays?
- Please leave.</b>

529
00:34:11,646 --> 00:34:13,916
<b>You two don't seem
to be meeting these days.</b>

530
00:34:13,916 --> 00:34:14,986
<b>Did you break up?</b>

531
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:16,087
<b>Let's go.</b>

532
00:34:16,787 --> 00:34:18,687
<b>Gosh. Come on.</b>

533
00:34:19,226 --> 00:34:21,226
<b>Is it that hard...</b>

534
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:24,127
<b>to answer yes or no?</b>

535
00:34:29,236 --> 00:34:30,236
<b>Ha Jin.</b>

536
00:34:33,967 --> 00:34:37,337
<b>I talked with Ms. Park,
so don't worry about it.</b>

537
00:34:37,706 --> 00:34:39,606
<b>Let's grab something to eat soon.</b>

538
00:34:44,476 --> 00:34:45,486
<b>Let's go.</b>

539
00:34:50,787 --> 00:34:51,787
<b>Ha Jin.</b>

540
00:34:52,826 --> 00:34:55,426
<b>Hey, Chul.
Are you here to see Ms. Park?</b>

541
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:57,826
<b>Yes, but she's still having
a meeting.</b>

542
00:34:58,127 --> 00:34:59,396
<b>We need to talk.</b>

543
00:34:59,666 --> 00:35:00,967
<b>Later.</b>

544
00:35:00,967 --> 00:35:02,367
<b>She's feeling under the weather.</b>

545
00:35:02,367 --> 00:35:05,067
<b>- It won't take long.
- No, you can talk later.</b>

546
00:35:05,167 --> 00:35:06,636
<b>Why are you doing this
all of a sudden?</b>

547
00:35:06,636 --> 00:35:08,136
<b>Just tell me!</b>

548
00:35:08,136 --> 00:35:09,877
<b>I'll call you later
and explain everything.</b>

549
00:35:09,877 --> 00:35:10,877
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

550
00:35:19,146 --> 00:35:20,417
<b>Ha Jin.</b>

551
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:27,987
<b>Are you listening to me?</b>

552
00:35:37,266 --> 00:35:38,836
<b>Hey, are you okay?</b>

553
00:35:39,466 --> 00:35:40,466
<b>Yes.</b>

554
00:35:40,567 --> 00:35:42,937
<b>Why were all of them here?</b>

555
00:35:45,377 --> 00:35:46,607
<b>You're here.</b>

556
00:35:46,747 --> 00:35:47,747
<b>Ms. Park.</b>

557
00:35:48,076 --> 00:35:50,446
<b>I came down
since you weren't coming.</b>

558
00:35:51,177 --> 00:35:52,817
<b>Why do you look so down?</b>

559
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,886
<b>What did Director Ji say?
Why was he here?</b>

560
00:35:55,057 --> 00:35:56,386
<b>Well...</b>

561
00:35:56,557 --> 00:36:00,857
<b>It seems like you'll have to work
on his movie.</b>

562
00:36:01,086 --> 00:36:02,927
<b>What? Why?</b>

563
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:04,257
<b>She can't.</b>

564
00:36:04,257 --> 00:36:06,396
<b>I wanted to say no too but...</b>

565
00:36:07,196 --> 00:36:09,937
<b>First, come inside.</b>

566
00:36:35,427 --> 00:36:36,427
<b>Jeong Hoon.</b>

567
00:36:38,526 --> 00:36:40,326
<b>Jeong Hoon, open up.</b>

568
00:36:43,536 --> 00:36:44,536
<b>Jeong Hoon.</b>

569
00:36:45,667 --> 00:36:47,807
<b>Jeong Hoon. Open up.</b>

570
00:36:47,807 --> 00:36:49,437
<b>I know you're in there.</b>

571
00:36:50,937 --> 00:36:51,946
<b>Jeong Hoon.</b>

572
00:36:57,677 --> 00:37:00,417
<b>Since her role is an anchor,
I've prepared some formal outfits.</b>

573
00:37:04,586 --> 00:37:05,757
<b>How about this?</b>

574
00:37:05,987 --> 00:37:07,557
<b>Isn't it too old-fashioned?</b>

575
00:37:07,557 --> 00:37:09,156
<b>Does she need to wear something
so formal...</b>

576
00:37:09,156 --> 00:37:10,396
<b>just because she's an anchor?</b>

577
00:37:10,396 --> 00:37:12,927
<b>What do you think?
Doesn't it look too bland?</b>

578
00:37:18,266 --> 00:37:19,266
<b>Hey.</b>

579
00:37:20,406 --> 00:37:21,406
<b>Yes?</b>

580
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:23,136
<b>Why have you been acting like this
since yesterday?</b>

581
00:37:23,576 --> 00:37:25,007
<b>Is it because of Director Ji?</b>

582
00:37:25,846 --> 00:37:27,047
<b>He's such a pain.</b>

583
00:37:27,047 --> 00:37:29,047
<b>There are so many actresses
who want to work with him,</b>

584
00:37:29,047 --> 00:37:30,146
<b>so why is he doing this?</b>

585
00:37:30,146 --> 00:37:32,016
<b>How dare he threaten Ms. Park?</b>

586
00:37:33,016 --> 00:37:34,846
<b>- You're right.
- Don't worry.</b>

587
00:37:34,846 --> 00:37:37,257
<b>I'm going to make sure
you don't work with him.</b>

588
00:37:37,257 --> 00:37:38,456
<b>Never.</b>

589
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:43,826
<b>What is this?</b>

590
00:37:44,997 --> 00:37:45,997
<b>What is it?</b>

591
00:37:47,096 --> 00:37:48,896
<b>Can you reach Jeong Hoon?</b>

592
00:37:49,096 --> 00:37:50,836
<b>I haven't been able to for days.</b>

593
00:37:50,836 --> 00:37:52,136
<b>I'm getting worried.</b>

594
00:38:08,446 --> 00:38:09,956
<b>Anchor Lee, it's me.</b>

595
00:38:09,956 --> 00:38:11,886
<b>Please open up.</b>

596
00:38:12,286 --> 00:38:14,227
<b>Why don't you call him again?</b>

597
00:38:15,156 --> 00:38:16,156
<b>Anchor Lee.</b>

598
00:38:16,156 --> 00:38:17,526
<b>What's wrong?</b>

599
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:20,227
<b>Hello, sir.</b>

600
00:38:20,497 --> 00:38:21,766
<b>It's our friend's house.</b>

601
00:38:21,766 --> 00:38:24,367
<b>We're worried since we haven't
been able to reach him.</b>

602
00:38:24,367 --> 00:38:26,706
<b>I know that
this is Anchor Lee's house.</b>

603
00:38:26,706 --> 00:38:29,607
<b>Wait. Aren't you Yeo Ha Jin?</b>

604
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:31,706
<b>Have you seen him recently?</b>

605
00:38:31,706 --> 00:38:34,776
<b>No. I haven't seen him
for several days...</b>

606
00:38:34,776 --> 00:38:36,817
<b>and thought it was odd.</b>

607
00:38:37,276 --> 00:38:39,586
<b>Is there a way to open this door?</b>

608
00:38:39,586 --> 00:38:40,786
<b>Without his permission?</b>

609
00:38:40,786 --> 00:38:42,317
<b>I'd get in trouble for doing that.</b>

610
00:38:42,317 --> 00:38:43,817
<b>It may be urgent.</b>

611
00:38:43,817 --> 00:38:47,057
<b>I think it's better for you
to call 911.</b>

612
00:38:47,057 --> 00:38:48,526
<b>Right, 911.</b>

613
00:38:48,757 --> 00:38:49,927
<b>911.</b>

614
00:38:53,596 --> 00:38:54,596
<b>Anchor Lee.</b>

615
00:38:57,336 --> 00:38:59,567
<b>Why didn't he answer
if he was in there all along?</b>

616
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:05,877
<b>Sir, it must be difficult
working here.</b>

617
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:20,087
<b>How much did you drink?</b>

618
00:39:22,127 --> 00:39:23,796
<b>As you can see, I drank a lot.</b>

619
00:39:24,127 --> 00:39:25,526
<b>I thought you didn't enjoy drinking.</b>

620

<b>You sound like a close friend.</b>

628

<b>One thing I know for sure...</b>

629
00:39:57,627 --> 00:40:00,026
<b>is that this is unlike you.</b>

630

632
00:40:15,107 --> 00:40:17,276
<b>Even until the end,
she was worried about me...</b>

633
00:40:17,276 --> 00:40:19,316
<b>and didn't think
about her poor self.</b>

634
00:40:21,617 --> 00:40:23,487
<b>It was all because I was her son.</b>

635

<b>Your mother did that
out of her love for you.</b>

<b>Don't bring up
the word love that easily.</b>

637
00:40:36,766 --> 00:40:38,337
<b>I didn't bring it up easily.</b>

641
00:40:48,276 --> 00:40:49,646
<b>Not you.</b>

642
00:40:51,447 --> 00:40:53,016
<b>You forgot everything.</b>

643
00:40:53,516 --> 00:40:56,257
<b>You forgot everything, and you live
as if nothing had happened.</b>

<b>I can't visit him right now.</b>

<b>that I hope
your dream doesn't trouble you.</b>

00:53:30,007 --> 00:53:32,507
<b>I did it at the funeral
when he was distracted.</b>

774
00:53:33,776 --> 00:53:37,276
<b>I was worried
that something might happen to him.</b>

775
00:53:39,316 --> 00:53:40,487
<b>In the end,</b>

776
00:53:40,487 --> 00:53:43,286
<b>I treated Jeong Hoon like a patient
and kept a watch on him.</b>

777
00:53:43,957 --> 00:53:45,516
<b>Just like my father.</b>

778
00:53:46,427 --> 00:53:48,187
<b>But you had no other choice.</b>

779
00:53:48,526 --> 00:53:50,997
<b>You had to do something
for Anchor Lee.</b>

780
00:53:52,657 --> 00:53:56,137
<b>Perhaps, I might have driven him
out of his own house.</b>

781
00:53:57,866 --> 00:54:00,036
<b>I shouldn't have gone to his house.</b>

782
00:54:00,266 --> 00:54:02,007
<b>I shouldn't have talked rashly.</b>

783
00:54:05,977 --> 00:54:08,546
<b>Where on earth is he going?</b>

784
00:54:14,586 --> 00:54:17,116
<b>Now, I know where he's headed.</b>

785
00:54:30,437 --> 00:54:34,667
<b>(The late Seo Mi Hyun)</b>

786
00:54:34,667 --> 00:54:36,036
<b>I'm glad...</b>

787
00:54:37,076 --> 00:54:40,007
<b>this place has a lot of trees
which you like.</b>

788
00:54:44,576 --> 00:54:47,887
<b>There are so many things
I want to ask you.</b>

789
00:54:49,487 --> 00:54:52,487
<b>But I can't get your answers now.</b>

790
00:54:58,096 --> 00:54:59,927
<b>(The late Seo Mi Hyun)</b>

791
00:55:01,697 --> 00:55:04,667
<b>But still, I want to ask you
this one question.</b>

792
00:55:06,336 --> 00:55:07,806
<b>Mom!</b>

793
00:55:11,137 --> 00:55:12,977
<b>I'm...</b>

794
00:55:13,707 --> 00:55:18,217
<b>so happy
that you're with me, Jeong Hoon.</b>

795
00:55:23,387 --> 00:55:25,657
<b>Were you really happy with me?</b>

796
00:55:26,116 --> 00:55:28,487
<b>(The late Seo Mi Hyun)</b>

797
00:55:58,257 --> 00:55:59,657
<b>His cell phone is in the car.</b>

798
00:56:00,957 --> 00:56:02,187
<b>Let's go that way.</b>

799
00:56:06,326 --> 00:56:09,126
<b>(The late Seo Mi Hyun)</b>

800
00:56:10,167 --> 00:56:11,467
<b>Is this the place?</b>

801
00:56:12,296 --> 00:56:13,306
<b>Yes.</b>

802
00:56:16,336 --> 00:56:17,507
<b>Snow.</b>

803
00:56:18,407 --> 00:56:20,947
<b>Anchor Lee has a bad memory
about snow, right?</b>

804
00:56:22,576 --> 00:56:24,147
<b>I thought so.</b>

805
00:56:24,776 --> 00:56:27,717
<b>When it snowed the other day,
something was off about him.</b>

806
00:56:28,447 --> 00:56:30,316
<b>Shouldn't we try
to find him quickly then?</b>

807
00:56:30,586 --> 00:56:33,387
<b>His car is here. I don't think
he could've gone far from here.</b>

808
00:56:33,387 --> 00:56:34,487
<b>Let's split and look for him.</b>

809
00:56:34,487 --> 00:56:35,487
<b>Okay.</b>

810
00:58:15,586 --> 00:58:16,826
<b>Anchor Lee!</b>

811
00:58:20,326 --> 00:58:21,397
<b>Anchor Lee.</b>

812
00:58:25,237 --> 00:58:26,296
<b>Anchor Lee!</b>

813
00:58:29,306 --> 00:58:30,677
<b>Are you all right?</b>

814
00:58:35,876 --> 00:58:38,546
<b>Anchor Lee, get yourself together.
Please.</b>

815
00:59:29,167 --> 00:59:31,296
<b>Are you okay? Are you awake?</b>

816
01:00:26,786 --> 01:00:29,526
<b>Gosh, what perfect timing.</b>

817
01:00:29,526 --> 01:00:31,197
<b>I was about to wake you.</b>

818
01:00:32,026 --> 01:00:33,126
<b>Where are we?</b>

819
01:00:33,126 --> 01:00:34,897
<b>Where do you think we are?</b>

820
01:00:34,897 --> 01:00:38,296
<b>Do you know how tough it was to find
lodging while dragging you around?</b>

821
01:00:38,937 --> 01:00:41,566
<b>If you're up,
wake up and take a seat here.</b>

822
01:00:41,566 --> 01:00:42,806
<b>Don't be a crybaby.</b>

823
01:00:44,376 --> 01:00:47,477
<b>What about Ha Jin?
I thought she was here.</b>

824
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:50,247
<b>She watched over you the whole time,
then left not long ago.</b>

825
01:00:51,217 --> 01:00:52,846
<b>Ha Kyung picked her up.</b>

826
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:56,086
<b>Come and take a seat.
Ha Jin bought...</b>

827
01:00:56,957 --> 01:00:59,616
<b>this porridge for you. Eat up.</b>

828
01:01:11,296 --> 01:01:12,897
<b>I'm sorry I had to leave first.</b>

829
01:01:13,467 --> 01:01:15,937
<b>Make sure you eat everything.</b>

830
01:01:32,457 --> 01:01:34,126
<b>Are you sure
you don't have to go to a hospital?</b>

831
01:01:34,786 --> 01:01:37,356
<b>I already took medicine.
I just need to get some rest.</b>

832
01:01:38,096 --> 01:01:40,766
<b>Why did you stay there
until you got this sick?</b>

833
01:01:40,766 --> 01:01:42,667
<b>Why are you so foolish?</b>

834
01:01:46,497 --> 01:01:49,066
<b>I promised I'll stay by his side.</b>

835
01:01:51,536 --> 01:01:53,907
<b>I was really heartbroken,</b>

836
01:01:56,747 --> 01:01:58,747
<b>but there's nothing I could do.</b>

837
01:01:59,647 --> 01:02:01,417
<b>Doctor Yoo is there with him.</b>

838
01:02:03,757 --> 01:02:06,356
<b>You shouldn't be worried about him.
You're burning up.</b>

839
01:02:07,026 --> 01:02:09,187
<b>Wait here.
I have to get a wet towel.</b>

840
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:39,846
<b>(Find Me in Your Memory)</b>

841
01:03:39,846 --> 01:03:41,046
<b>Are you suspicious of me?</b>

842
01:03:41,046 --> 01:03:43,657
<b>It wasn't me. Okay? It's not me!</b>

843
01:03:43,657 --> 01:03:45,157
<b>I don't think this is right.</b>

844
01:03:45,157 --> 01:03:47,657
<b>If it's not too urgent,
can you tell me?</b>

845
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:49,826
<b>Who does she think she is
to boss me around?</b>

846
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:51,326
<b>Aren't these
all pictures of Ms. Yeo?</b>

847
01:03:51,326 --> 01:03:52,856
<b>Call that newspaper company...</b>

848
01:03:52,856 --> 01:03:54,927
<b>and find out if Park Soo Chang is
at work, then call me back.</b>

849
01:03:54,927 --> 01:03:58,237
<b>You broke into her house
and sent threatening letters.</b>

850
01:03:58,237 --> 01:04:00,836
<b>It wasn't me.
I'm not Yeo Ha Jin's stalker.</b>

851
01:04:00,836 --> 01:04:01,836
<b>Where are you?</b>

852
01:04:01,836 --> 01:04:04,677
<b>Is it because of that woman,
Yeo Ha Jin?</b>

853
01:04:04,677 --> 01:04:06,036
<b>It's nothing for you to worry about.</b>

854
01:04:06,036 --> 01:04:08,507
<b>That jerk isn't just a normal guy.</b>

855
01:04:08,507 --> 01:04:09,576
<b>Ha Jin!</b>
