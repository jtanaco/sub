<b>Even so, how could you...</b>

162
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,690
<b>Eun Ho woke up?</b>

163
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:00,730
<b>Yes, but he can't remember anything.</b>

164
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:02,260
<b>Not just the accident...</b>

165
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,500
<b>but the entire past month.</b>

166
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,070
<b>Sir...</b>

167
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,970
<b>Sir, I'll see you tomorrow at the office.</b>

168
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:16,680
<b>I need to deal with something more important right now.</b>

169
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,480
<b>There you are.</b>

170
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,880
<b>I just heard about Eun Ho's condition.</b>

171
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:27,620
<b>My gosh, I'd love to meet him.</b>

172
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:30,920
<b>But right now, I'm a stranger to him.</b>

173
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,660
<b>So I should hold back, right?</b>

174
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:33,930
<b>Yes, just hang in there.</b>

175
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,230
<b>He'll quickly get his memory back.</b>

176
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,000
<b>Of course.</b>

177
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:43,140
<b>Detective Cha, do you want Eun Ho...</b>

178
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,810
<b>to get his memory back?</b>

179
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:47,470
<b>I guess you don't.</b>

180
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,680
<b>What's so important about knowing the truth?</b>

181
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,080
<b>It's not like anything will change.</b>

182
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,450
<b>Do you really think it'd be worth the pain?</b>

183
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,850
<b>For me, yes.</b>

184
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:58,290
<b>No, no.</b>

185
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:01,920
<b>I wasn't talking about you. I was talking about Eun Ho.</b>

186
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:03,920
<b>Eun Ho's brain...</b>

187
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:07,330
<b>is trying to protect him...</b>

188
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:08,830
<b>from pain and danger.</b>

189
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,730
<b>Isn't that amazing?</b>

190
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,470
<b>Does that mean he'll be in danger...</b>

191
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,670
<b>once he gets his memory back?</b>

192
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:19,970
<b>My goodness.</b>

193
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:23,580
<b>You got the wrong message again.</b>

194
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,550
<b>The more he starts to remember,</b>

195
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,750
<b>the more he might remember things...</b>

196
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,220
<b>that he'd rather just forget.</b>

197
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,390
<b>And that will last forever.</b>

198
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:36,220
<b>Wouldn't that be like living in a nightmare?</b>

199
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:44,130
<b>(Special Crime Squad)</b>

200
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,910
<b>You look like you lost the country or something.</b>

201
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,710
<b>Have you ever seen anyone who's lost their country?</b>

202
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,150
<b>I'm sorry, but don't get on my nerves.</b>

203
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,030
<b>- Will you please... - I have a favor to ask.</b>

204
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:21,130
<b>- Go ahead. - Did you write your report...</b>

205
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:24,200
<b>based on exactly what you saw on the day that Seo Sang Won died?</b>

206
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,280
<b>Ms. Cha probably seemed a little suspicious that day.</b>

207
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,440
<b>But you didn't write that down.</b>

208
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,650
<b>- So what? - I want you...</b>

209
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,180
<b>to keep your statement consistent with the report you wrote.</b>

210
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:44,190
<b>- Aren't you angry? - About what?</b>

211
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:46,960
<b>That she never told us that she was friends with the victim?</b>

212
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:48,500
<b>If she didn't tell us,</b>

213
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,060
<b>she wouldn't have been able to be in charge of the case.</b>

214
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,970
<b>Ms. Cha should be the one telling me all this stuff.</b>

215
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,470
<b>Why must I hear all this from you?</b>

216
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:00,110
<b>Because Ms. Cha would feel too bad to ask you this.</b>

217
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,940
<b>I don't want to lose her.</b>

218
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:05,310
<b>We're finally seeing progress with Eun Ho's case.</b>

219
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:06,610
<b>And the same goes for the stigmata serial murders...</b>

220
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:12,090
<b>What do you mean? What are you talking about?</b>

221
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:15,120
<b>Why did you suddenly join our team?</b>

222
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:18,930
<b>Does Ms. Cha have something on you?</b>

223
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:20,230
<b>Do you really think she'd use...</b>

224
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,500
<b>my weakness against me to force me to join her team?</b>

225
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:24,360
<b>Who knows?</b>

226
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,570
<b>She looked at a photo of her friend's corpse with us,</b>

227
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:29,570
<b>but she didn't even blink.</b>

228
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:36,340
<b>I overheard her talk about the conversation she had...</b>

229
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,780
<b>with Seo Sang Won on the rooftop.</b>

230
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:42,580
<b>She couldn't write it on the report.</b>

231
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,320
<b>Seo Sang Won might've had an accomplice.</b>

232
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:48,090
<b>Please do me a favor.</b>

233
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:50,360
<b>Please stick to your report when they ask you questions.</b>

234
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,290
<b>If you refuse to do this for me, I'll just have to confess...</b>

235
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,600
<b>that I already knew everything.</b>

236
00:13:58,130 --> 00:13:59,200
<b>Are you threatening me?</b>

237
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,100
<b>Who uses something they like to threaten someone?</b>

238
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,410
<b>- Mom. - Yes?</b>

239
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,380
<b>You should get some rest.</b>

240
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:19,120
<b>Are you tired? Do you want to lie down?</b>

241
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,920
<b>No, I'm okay.</b>

242
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:27,790
<b>Then let's stay like this for a bit longer.</b>

243
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,760
<b>Once you fall asleep, I'll...</b>

244
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,070
<b>Mom.</b>

245
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,770
<b>How did I get hurt?</b>

246
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,840
<b>I'll tell you...</b>

247
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,850
<b>once you get better.</b>

248
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,150
<b>Mom.</b>

249
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:52,590
<b>Did I tell you anything strange...</b>

250
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:56,320
<b>before I got hurt?</b>

251
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,660
<b>Hey, you're here.</b>

252
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,630
<b>Come on in.</b>

253
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,840
<b>Don't you have any questions for me?</b>

254
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,740
<b>Eun Ho.</b>

255
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,540
<b>Next time.</b>

256
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:20,350
<b>I actually have a lot of questions for you.</b>

257
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:22,580
<b>But right now, I'm only going to ask you one thing.</b>

258
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,850
<b>If you had to hide something, where would you put it?</b>

259
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,860
<b>It depends on whether...</b>

260
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:31,960
<b>it's a thing or a secret.</b>

261
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,390
<b>- It's a thing. - What thing?</b>

262
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:35,930
<b>I don't know.</b>

263
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:38,160
<b>What is it that I had to hide?</b>

264
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:41,570
<b>It's not like I'd come across a lot of money.</b>

265
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,670
<b>What if someone asked you to keep something safe for a while?</b>

266
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,840
<b>Is it related to how I got injured?</b>

267
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,540
<b>No. It happened before you got hurt.</b>

268
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:53,410
<b>You saved a man's life and was awarded...</b>

269
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,690
<b>It's not important to you,</b>

270
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:00,990
<b>but it is important to the person who left it with you.</b>

271
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:02,490
<b>Where do you think...</b>

272
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,530
<b>you'd have kept it?</b>

273
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:11,970
<b>In my apartment?</b>

274
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:16,470
<b>The balcony or study?</b>

275
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:17,940
<b>Or the kitchen.</b>

276
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:20,410
<b>Okay.</b>

277
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,180
<b>You should...</b>

278
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:25,280
<b>rest now. Lie down.</b>

279
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,110
<b>- So Yeon, you should... - Why!</b>

280
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,020
<b>Why won't anyone tell me anything?</b>

281
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,890
<b>Why won't anyone tell me how I ended up like this?</b>

282
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,860
<b>It wasn't a car crash, was it?</b>

283
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,900
<b>I can tell you what I think,</b>

284
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,970
<b>but only you know the whole truth.</b>

285
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:48,030
<b>Do you still want to hear?</b>

286
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,170
<b>I don't want him to regain the memory.</b>

287
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:57,140
<b>Losing a month of his life won't affect his future, will it?</b>

288
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,050
<b>It can't have been a good memory.</b>

289
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:02,250
<b>I don't want him to be scared or suffer.</b>

290
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:14,830
<b>You fell from a roof 10 floors high.</b>

291
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,530
<b>Young Jin!</b>

292
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:18,400
<b>You used the descending life line,</b>

293
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,470
<b>then halfway down, you untied yourself and fell.</b>

294
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:23,500
<b>That's what I know so far.</b>

295
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:27,140
<b>I will not stop until I know the whole truth.</b>

296
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,610
<b>But I might fail.</b>

297
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:29,610
<b>That's enough.</b>

298
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:31,910
<b>Do you mind living with an incomplete puzzle?</b>

299
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:34,310
<b>It might feel like living a fractured life.</b>

300
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:36,350
<b>Come outside.</b>

301
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:39,390
<b>Come outside. Right now.</b>

302
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,330
<b>Just because you did,</b>

303
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:53,700
<b>don't force my son to live like that.</b>

304
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,540
<b>- What does that mean? - I read the news.</b>

305
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,440
<b>The schoolgirl, the eighth victim of the stigmata serial murders.</b>

306
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,140
<b>She was your friend, right?</b>

307
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,710
<b>Did finding the culprit...</b>

308
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,550
<b>make you feel better?</b>

309
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,430
<b>She found him at last.</b>

310
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:42,720
<b>Um, this one.</b>

311
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:44,650
<b>No.</b>

312
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:47,220
<b>Wrap the bulgogi in lettuce.</b>

313
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:49,520
<b>- In lettuce? - Yes. Make a wrap.</b>

314
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,620
<b>Are your hands clean?</b>

315
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,830
<b>You didn't wash them?</b>

316
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:55,660
<b>Gosh, that's gross.</b>

317
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:57,730
<b>Wash your hands clean.</b>

318
00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:59,570
<b>As the atmosphere becomes tense...</b>

319
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:00,630
<b>Hey, Du Seok.</b>

320
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:03,770
<b>Hey, hey. Hey!</b>

321
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:06,910
<b>Eat what I give you.</b>

322
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:09,680
<b>- What are you doing? - Then eat porridge.</b>

323
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,980
<b>The gazelle runs away at top speed.</b>

324
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,350
<b>The cheetah runs for food...</b>

325
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:16,680
<b>Watch it.</b>

326
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,220
<b>and the gazelle runs to live.</b>

327
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:21,450
<b>They're both running to survive.</b>

328
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:22,460
<b>Is this fun?</b>

329
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,220
<b>The animal world is...</b>

330
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:27,360
<b>an endless cycle of eating and being eaten.</b>

331
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,430
<b>What about humans then?</b>

332
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,600
<b>What do you mean?</b>

333
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,560
<b>We're animals too.</b>

334
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,300
<b>Memory loss.</b>

335
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,870
<b>Do you think they're lying to put us off guard?</b>

336
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:37,870
<b>Who?</b>

337
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:40,110
<b>Cha Young Jin? Lee Sun Woo?</b>

338
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:42,580
<b>Do you think they'd gamble with a kid?</b>

339
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:45,180
<b>If his memory never returns, the kid is of no use.</b>

340
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,410
<b>The best outcome is...</b>

341
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,050
<b>for Eun Ho to regain his memory,</b>

342
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:51,950
<b>and when Jang Ki Ho comes to reclaim what he gave Eun Ho,</b>

343
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:53,950
<b>we catch Ki Ho.</b>

344
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:55,120
<b>We'll kill the kid, right?</b>

345
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,490
<b>Let's just kill them both.</b>

346
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,490
<b>Without the kid and Jang Ki Ho,</b>

347
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:00,130
<b>your secret will be buried forever.</b>

348
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:04,130
<b>No. That's the most boring scenario.</b>

349
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:05,270
<b>Du Seok.</b>

350
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,100
<b>Unless we find and destroy it, it never disappears.</b>

351
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,140
<b>It exists some place I don't know.</b>

352
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:11,740
<b>Whenever I think of that,</b>

353
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:14,070
<b>I want to just blow up planet earth.</b>

354
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,040
<b>That's how annoying it is.</b>

355
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,680
<b>- Eun Ho must regain his memory. - What?</b>

356
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,350
<b>For peace on earth.</b>

357
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,980
<b>You're so witty.</b>

358
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,820
<b>It's a large piece of prey.</b>

359
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,990
<b>Eun Ho.</b>

360
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,790
<b>We're late, aren't we?</b>

361
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:43,170
<b>What I did was too rash.</b>

362
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:47,410
<b>I put myself first and didn't think of your condition.</b>

363
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,810
<b>I want to know...</b>

364
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,280
<b>what happened to me.</b>

365
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,810
<b>Of course you want to know.</b>

366
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:55,850
<b>You will find out.</b>

367
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,750
<b>But Eun Ho, first, you must recover.</b>

368
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:02,290
<b>Don't try to remember anything right now.</b>

369
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:03,820
<b>Don't imagine anything either.</b>

370
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,760
<b>Then I'll ask just one thing.</b>

371
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:08,130
<b>Why am I in such a nice room?</b>

372
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:12,070
<b>Now that you're awake, you'll be moved.</b>

373
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:29,320
<b>I want to have beef too.</b>

374
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,390
<b>You are.</b>

375
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:34,590
<b>This is beef too.</b>

376
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:39,530
<b>- What? - Do you want a beef slap?</b>

377
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:41,660
<b>How dare you say that?</b>

378
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,230
<b>You should offer to buy me...</b>

379
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:44,260
<b>What's this?</b>

380
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:47,770
<b>Do you still want to pass the exam to get promoted?</b>

381
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,170
<b>No.</b>

382
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,410
<b>That's why the book's stuffed in there.</b>

383
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:54,970
<b>Is that why you put it carefully...</b>

384
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:57,510
<b>where it's always within arm's reach?</b>

385
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:02,150
<b>How did I end up in Homicide?</b>

386
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:05,750
<b>There's no time to study for the exam.</b>

387
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:07,620
<b>So what? You'll quit?</b>

388
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,160
<b>I told you a few times.</b>

389
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:13,360
<b>Homicide just doesn't suit me.</b>

390
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:15,230
<b>Especially all these stake-outs.</b>

391
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:17,600
<b>Whenever I'm on a stake-out...</b>

392
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,800
<b>- Get down. Who's that? - Who's who?</b>

393
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:24,400
<b>Oh? Isn't that Yun Hee Seob?</b>

394
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,810
<b>Right? I didn't mistake him, did I?</b>

395
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:29,680
<b>Why do you think there's an accomplice?</b>

396

<b>The stigmata marks.</b>

397
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,780
<b>- On the hands? - Yes.</b>

398
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:36,180
<b>Before Seo Sang Won died, he said Im Hee Jung was punished,</b>

399
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:39,520
<b>and the other victims were blessed with resurrection.</b>

400
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,820
<b>There would be different marks for punishments and blessings?</b>

401
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,760
<b>We all know that much.</b>

402
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,960
<b>He said that Choi Su Jung didn't qualify.</b>

403
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:49,100
<b>She didn't qualify?</b>

404
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,570
<b>Same marks and different results.</b>

405
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:53,800
<b>Qualifications.</b>

406
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,740
<b>It's not the victim's qualifications.</b>

407
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:59,910
<b>It's the criminal's.</b>

408
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:02,680
<b>The one who killed Choi Su Jung...</b>

409
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,180
<b>could be someone else.</b>

<b>Yes, Ji Won. What is it?</b>

418
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:46,090
<b>Oh? Why aren't you in bed?</b>

419
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:49,420
<b>Dad promised to read to me,</b>

<b>but he went out to work.</b>

421
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:51,860
<b>I see.</b>

422
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:54,430
<b>Come in. I'll read to you.</b>

<b>- What? - Your eyes look sad.</b>

424

<b>Do they?</b>

425
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:09,110
<b>I was reading something sad.</b>

<b>As sad as "The Sun and the Moon"?</b>

427

<b>Yes, as sad as "The Sun and the Moon".</b>

<b>This story isn't sad.</b>

<b>- I'll read for you. - Perfect.</b>

<b>Let's hear you read to me.</b>

<b>Wouldn't you love to have a younger sibling?</b>

<b>You'd prefer a younger sibling too?</b>

<b>Not an older one, right?</b>

436

<b>- What do you mean? - Eun Ho...</b>

<b>Yes. But I said that I wanted...</b>

<b>a younger sibling and not an older brother.</b>

<b>But when I said that, Eun Ho's eyes...</b>

443

<b>became sad like yours were.</b>

444

<b>When did you talk about that?</b>

445
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,560
<b>Was it when we played soccer in the park?</b>

446

<b>No?</b>

447
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:01,830
<b>Then was it when we played games at home?</b>

448

<b>No. Later on, at school.</b>

<b>Why come here when you could call me?</b>

<b>Why hasn't he called me yet?</b>

454
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:22,220
<b>I passed the message.</b>

455
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:23,880
<b>After that, it's up to him.</b>

456
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,090
<b>Do you know why he's in hiding?</b>

457
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:27,450
<b>Beats me.</b>

458
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:31,560
<b>You...</b>

459
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:35,330
<b>- must pass on this message. - What is it?</b>

460
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:38,060
<b>Tell him that the Ko Eun Ho, the boy who saved his life,</b>

<b>is awake from his coma.</b>

00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:42,970
<b>Is that all I need to tell him?</b>

463
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:44,800
<b>Tell him that we should go and see him together.</b>

464
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,110
<b>Sure thing. I'll tell him word for word.</b>

465
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:50,510
<b>Enjoy your meal then. I'll leave you to it.</b>

466

<b>He has no respect for meat, does he?</b>

467
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:11,200
<b>I'm dying of curiosity.</b>

468
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,800
<b>Just like me, you'll never be able to leave Homicide.</b>

469
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,740
<b>We'll see.</b>

470
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:22,810
<b>What the...</b>

471
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,840
<b>He's going back inside.</b>

472
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:35,860
<b>So there's something more important you need to say.</b>

473
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,420

<b>wanted to reconcile with Eun Ho.</b>

<b>He thought sharing the answers would help.</b>

<b>It's obvious what happened.</b>

914

<b>able to get the answer sheet?</b>

917

<b>He must be rich...</b>

<b>suffer from a condition that makes him sneeze...</b>

<b>Did you know that?</b>

929
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:36,620

<b>Are you like that too?</b>

931
00:55:39,390 --> 00:55:40,490
<b>No.</b>

932
00:55:40,490 --> 00:55:43,060
<b>Then what about Eun Ho's father?</b>

933
00:55:44,730 --> 00:55:46,400
<b>A few months ago,</b>

934
00:55:47,130 --> 00:55:49,600
<b>Eun Ho asked the same question.</b>

935
00:55:50,970 --> 00:55:52,840
<b>Is Eun Ho's condition...</b>

936
00:55:54,610 --> 00:55:56,540
<b>hereditary?</b>

937
00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:59,610
<b>It's called photic sneeze reflex and that...</b>

938
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:01,880
<b>is hereditary.</b>

939
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:05,450
<b>So at least one of the parents...</b>

940
00:56:05,450 --> 00:56:07,720
<b>passes it on to the child.</b>

941
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:14,030
<b>Drive home safely then.</b>

942

<b>I checked it before,</b>

946
00:56:42,850 --> 00:56:45,790
<b>but I didn't check who lived there.</b>

947
00:56:47,690 --> 00:56:49,390
<b>- Who? - Ju Dong Myung's...</b>

948
00:56:49,890 --> 00:56:51,430
<b>- What? - His little brother.</b>

949
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:53,260
<b>Han Sol?</b>

950
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:54,600
<b>He lives there with his aunt.</b>

951
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:56,830
<b>The call lasted four minutes.</b>

952
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:01,940
<b>That means Han Sol could've heard something.</b>

953
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:04,080
<b>That boy sure loves to chat.</b>

954

<b>(Du Seok)</b>

955
00:57:12,150 --> 00:57:14,550
<b>Du Seok, meet me at Han Sol's hospital room...</b>

956
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:16,990
<b>and buy whatever it is that kids love.</b>

957
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:21,690
<b>How delicious.</b>

958
00:57:29,430 --> 00:57:32,440
<b>This is a lot. How am I supposed to carry these?</b>

959
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:33,470
<b>You're right.</b>

960
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:35,170
<b>Then just choose one to keep instead.</b>

961
00:57:35,170 --> 00:57:37,110
<b>That's way harder!</b>

962
00:57:40,710 --> 00:57:44,780
<b>Han Sol, did you know that Eun Ho saved a man's life?</b>

963
00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:45,880
<b>Of course!</b>

964
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:47,850
<b>He called me that day...</b>

965
00:57:47,990 --> 00:57:49,550
<b>to say that he couldn't come.</b>

966
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:51,260
<b>I see.</b>

967
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:53,190
<b>Isn't Eun Ho the kindest?</b>

968
00:57:53,190 --> 00:57:54,960
<b>If he had saved me,</b>

969
00:57:54,990 --> 00:57:57,360
<b>I would've given him all the presents he wanted.</b>

970
00:57:57,430 --> 00:57:58,660
<b>He received something.</b>

971
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:01,130
<b>Really? What did he receive?</b>

972
00:58:01,130 --> 00:58:02,930
<b>- A book. - A book?</b>

973
00:58:03,570 --> 00:58:04,670
<b>What kind of book?</b>

974
00:58:04,670 --> 00:58:07,810
<b>A gospel. Gospel of New Life.</b>

<b>The sly old man purposely made the gospel his map...</b>

<b>Let's fetch the gospel and head to Ki Ho.</b>

<b>Will he willingly read us the map?</b>
