ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

00:00:12.476 --> 00:00:13.978
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:22.111
Saeroyi.

00:00:39.211 --> 00:00:40.212
You

00:00:42.548 --> 00:00:44.091
brought me to my knees.

00:01:00.024 --> 00:01:01.317
Why are you being like this?

00:01:02.485 --> 00:01:05.154
Your beliefs and ambition.
Where did they all go?

00:01:10.034 --> 00:01:11.994
This was enough
to bring you to your knees?

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:19.293
After all, you're surrendering
because I have more power.

00:01:26.133 --> 00:01:27.635
Where is Jang Geun-won?

00:01:35.935 --> 00:01:38.521
I thought this would be my last chance
to enjoy some entertainment.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.568
How disappointing.

00:01:47.363 --> 00:01:49.782
You're truly pathetic.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.455
But because you got down
on those pathetic knees of yours,

00:01:59.458 --> 00:02:02.128
I have no choice
but to desert my son once again.

00:02:39.331 --> 00:02:41.709
You're kneeling before me, your enemy.

00:02:43.252 --> 00:02:44.128
Tell me.

00:02:45.838 --> 00:02:47.131
How does it feel?

00:02:53.804 --> 00:02:54.972
I feel pathetic.

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:57.850
You do?

00:03:01.187 --> 00:03:03.981
-You may leave.
-How do you feel now, sir?

00:03:10.321 --> 00:03:11.906
You brought me to my knees.

00:03:12.948 --> 00:03:14.116
Are you happy?

00:03:24.335 --> 00:03:25.711
Is this gratifying for you?

00:03:27.922 --> 00:03:29.673
-Are you--
-Wanting

00:03:30.758 --> 00:03:33.594
to get back at you
kept me going until now.

00:03:38.891 --> 00:03:40.768
Jang Dae-hee, the chairman of Jangga Co.

00:03:41.894 --> 00:03:42.978
My enemy.

00:03:44.605 --> 00:03:47.525
You made my life hell.
But at the same time,

00:03:49.235 --> 00:03:50.528
you were an inspiring man.

00:03:54.782 --> 00:03:57.493
I had to admit that
despite our different values.

00:03:59.453 --> 00:04:00.496
I devoted

00:04:03.457 --> 00:04:05.334
my whole life

00:04:06.418 --> 00:04:07.836
to follow in your footsteps.

00:04:12.591 --> 00:04:13.592
I thought

00:04:15.886 --> 00:04:18.138
this fight was worth it.

00:04:19.765 --> 00:04:21.684
-Hold on.
-But that man

00:04:23.644 --> 00:04:24.687
threatened me

00:04:25.938 --> 00:04:28.315
to kneel before him
by holding my close ones hostage.

00:04:32.653 --> 00:04:35.739
I wasted over a decade of my life
following in the footsteps

00:04:35.823 --> 00:04:37.157
of such a disgusting old grouch?

00:04:40.828 --> 00:04:42.580
I deeply regret

00:04:46.709 --> 00:04:47.710
wasting my life.

00:04:51.589 --> 00:04:52.673
But look at the outcome.

00:04:53.966 --> 00:04:55.426
You got down on your knees before me.

00:04:56.468 --> 00:04:57.928
Sometimes, to get what you want--

00:05:01.473 --> 00:05:02.600
Let's go, Seung-kwon.

00:05:03.267 --> 00:05:04.310
Okay.

00:05:27.791 --> 00:05:29.710
After over a decade,

00:05:31.086 --> 00:05:32.129
I got to know you.

00:05:51.023 --> 00:05:53.567
THE FINAL EPISODE

00:05:53.734 --> 00:05:54.777
All right.

00:05:55.569 --> 00:05:57.279
Forget about Park Saeroyi.

00:05:58.238 --> 00:06:00.574
I want you to die, Jo Yi-seo.

00:06:21.428 --> 00:06:24.056
Don't waste your energy and stay still.

00:06:27.685 --> 00:06:28.769
Pick it up.

00:06:39.321 --> 00:06:41.073
Gosh, I'm terrified.

00:06:41.156 --> 00:06:42.032
Why?

00:06:42.741 --> 00:06:45.160
Do you want to fight against us?

00:06:46.912 --> 00:06:48.205
You guys are funny.

00:06:48.789 --> 00:06:51.667
Attack them as I count to three.

00:06:54.336 --> 00:06:55.170
Come on.

00:06:55.254 --> 00:06:56.380
One.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.716
Two, three.

00:06:58.799 --> 00:07:01.927
Good luck, Jang Geun-soo! Hang in there!

00:07:10.602 --> 00:07:11.937
What are you doing? Catch him.

00:07:13.063 --> 00:07:13.897
Damn it!

00:07:14.481 --> 00:07:15.899
Don't you dare come close to me.

00:07:21.113 --> 00:07:22.406
What are you doing?

00:07:24.074 --> 00:07:25.033
She told me

00:07:26.952 --> 00:07:27.911
to hang on.

00:07:43.761 --> 00:07:45.971
You know it will be dangerous.

00:07:49.725 --> 00:07:50.684
I will

00:07:52.311 --> 00:07:53.562
save Yi-seo.

00:07:55.397 --> 00:07:57.107
I know. That's why we're going there.

00:07:59.526 --> 00:08:01.028
You should also choose your priority.

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:03.614
What?

00:08:03.697 --> 00:08:05.616
Things will go haywire

00:08:05.741 --> 00:08:07.993
if you fail to make a decision.

00:08:08.911 --> 00:08:10.162
Even if

00:08:11.163 --> 00:08:13.624
we both get hurt

00:08:14.917 --> 00:08:17.586
or die, my priority is to save Yi-seo.

00:08:20.172 --> 00:08:21.673
Is that so?

00:08:22.841 --> 00:08:26.094
But I can't force you to do the same.

00:08:28.138 --> 00:08:30.933
My gosh, then why did you
ask me to come with you?

00:08:34.394 --> 00:08:35.354
Yi-seo

00:08:36.396 --> 00:08:38.065
may be a rude brat.

00:08:39.066 --> 00:08:40.859
But she's family now.

00:08:42.027 --> 00:08:43.403
I also care about her.

00:08:44.029 --> 00:08:45.864
We should work toward the same goal

00:08:47.115 --> 00:08:48.367
for better teamwork.

00:08:51.912 --> 00:08:52.955
Thank you.

00:08:53.664 --> 00:08:54.540
No problem.

00:08:56.041 --> 00:08:58.627
By the way,
I'm going to save Yi-seo even if you die.

00:09:21.525 --> 00:09:22.442
Are you okay?

00:09:23.902 --> 00:09:25.529
I bet you've never been stabbed before.

00:09:26.822 --> 00:09:30.909
It's useless to act brave
like those guys you see in movies.

00:09:31.451 --> 00:09:32.703
This is the reality.

00:09:42.296 --> 00:09:44.089
You really are tough.

00:09:45.048 --> 00:09:46.133
Hold on tight.

00:09:53.599 --> 00:09:54.766
That's enough.

00:09:57.227 --> 00:09:58.437
What about Yi-seo?

00:09:59.479 --> 00:10:00.314
You'll lose her.

00:10:04.693 --> 00:10:05.652
You're right.

00:10:08.155 --> 00:10:09.323
Start the car.

00:10:22.461 --> 00:10:25.297
You got everything you want
including Jangga Co.

00:10:26.089 --> 00:10:27.883
Just stay out of this.

00:10:32.429 --> 00:10:33.263
Everything I want?

00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:40.854
Throughout my entire life, I never got

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:44.149
what I wanted.

00:10:51.073 --> 00:10:52.115
But I have to say,

00:10:54.576 --> 00:10:56.870
I guess we really are brothers.

00:11:00.791 --> 00:11:02.042
What?

00:11:03.919 --> 00:11:05.003
We always used

00:11:07.172 --> 00:11:08.465
the wrong method.

00:11:13.887 --> 00:11:16.056
What is he doing? Aren't you coming?

00:11:19.518 --> 00:11:20.644
Keep him here.

00:11:56.555 --> 00:11:57.681
Hey!

00:11:58.390 --> 00:11:59.766
Give up already!

00:12:00.058 --> 00:12:01.852
You can't run away!

00:12:02.686 --> 00:12:05.063
You give up, you fucking loser!

00:12:09.067 --> 00:12:10.819
-Go get her.
-Yes, sir.

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:19.536
My gosh.

00:12:20.537 --> 00:12:21.872
She's unbelievable.

00:12:53.695 --> 00:12:54.529
My gosh.

00:13:13.006 --> 00:13:14.091
Run into it.

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:52.212
The airbags work nicely.

00:13:52.295 --> 00:13:53.630
This car is amazing.

00:13:56.633 --> 00:13:57.676
My gosh.

00:13:58.260 --> 00:13:59.761
Gosh, what is all this?

00:14:00.887 --> 00:14:01.888
My gosh.

00:14:06.059 --> 00:14:07.060
Boss?

00:14:09.938 --> 00:14:10.981
Yi-seo.

00:14:15.068 --> 00:14:16.111
Boss...

00:14:17.404 --> 00:14:18.405
Boss!

00:14:34.254 --> 00:14:35.589
Are you okay?

00:14:38.049 --> 00:14:39.259
I heard you got hurt.

00:14:41.011 --> 00:14:44.639
What in the world are you doing here?
Have you lost your mind?

00:14:46.308 --> 00:14:47.684
Saeroyi!

00:14:55.317 --> 00:14:56.568
You saved me some time.

00:14:57.944 --> 00:15:00.572
You came here to die, right?

00:15:02.782 --> 00:15:03.783
Saeroyi.

00:15:06.369 --> 00:15:07.412
Hee-hoon.

00:15:08.788 --> 00:15:10.498
You should've stayed at the hospital.

00:15:12.542 --> 00:15:14.920
I called the cops before I came here.

00:15:17.923 --> 00:15:19.591
Can you please just leave?

00:15:20.342 --> 00:15:22.177
You fucking coward.

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:23.428
Gosh, it hurts.

00:15:26.389 --> 00:15:27.432
You asshole.

00:15:28.725 --> 00:15:30.936
Seung-kwon, are you okay?

00:15:32.604 --> 00:15:35.482
Ms. Jo, it's nice to hear you
call me by my name.

00:15:36.608 --> 00:15:37.692
Seung-kwon.

00:15:37.776 --> 00:15:40.070
Yes, I know my priorities.

00:15:43.907 --> 00:15:46.952
Hurry up and get out of here.
I'll take care of this.

00:15:51.706 --> 00:15:52.582
Let's go.

00:15:57.087 --> 00:15:58.129
That darn little...

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:03.343
Choi Seung-kwon.

00:16:14.187 --> 00:16:15.021
Finish him.

00:16:22.821 --> 00:16:26.074
My gosh, you used to be one of us.

00:16:26.908 --> 00:16:28.076
But you're ruthless.

00:16:29.202 --> 00:16:30.620
"Don't hesitate."

00:16:31.329 --> 00:16:33.331
That's what you always used to say.

00:16:35.166 --> 00:16:36.418
I have to say,

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:39.671
-you're better off with us.
-No.

00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:44.384
I'm better at serving tables.

00:17:16.916 --> 00:17:18.126
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

00:17:19.044 --> 00:17:20.545
Why did you come here?

00:17:21.171 --> 00:17:22.130
Come here.

00:17:26.885 --> 00:17:28.345
This reminds me of that day

00:17:29.262 --> 00:17:30.805
when we both ran like crazy in Itaewon.

00:17:32.182 --> 00:17:34.142
Why are you suddenly talking about that?

00:17:36.019 --> 00:17:37.937
I missed you so much.

00:17:49.991 --> 00:17:51.076
You always

00:17:53.078 --> 00:17:54.704
worked so hard for me.

00:17:56.664 --> 00:17:58.083
And you always got hurt.

00:18:01.961 --> 00:18:03.088
What's going on?

00:18:05.173 --> 00:18:06.925
Are you sure you're okay?

00:18:11.888 --> 00:18:12.889
I can't believe this.

00:18:21.356 --> 00:18:22.607
My mind

00:18:25.902 --> 00:18:27.028
and heart

00:18:35.036 --> 00:18:36.162
are both filled with you.

00:18:44.629 --> 00:18:46.214
Is this how you felt?

00:18:46.965 --> 00:18:47.924
This is very

00:18:48.842 --> 00:18:50.009
heart beating.

00:18:52.929 --> 00:18:53.847
Boss.

00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:54.889
I love you.

00:19:01.396 --> 00:19:02.564
I love you, Yi-seo.

00:19:09.779 --> 00:19:11.072
I love you so much.

00:19:34.095 --> 00:19:35.638
Those crazy psychos.

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:02.373
Go. Run.

00:20:02.457 --> 00:20:04.584
I can't leave without you.

00:20:04.667 --> 00:20:06.377
Are you trying to die alone?

00:20:08.963 --> 00:20:10.632
The cops will call you.

00:20:10.715 --> 00:20:13.051
Answer the phone
and tell them where we are.

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:21.142
You guys are having fun, aren't you?

00:20:23.228 --> 00:20:24.938
Trust me and just go.

00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:28.066
Yi-seo.

00:20:31.319 --> 00:20:33.071
What a fucking joke.

00:20:33.947 --> 00:20:35.156
If you die,

00:20:36.241 --> 00:20:37.408
I'll die too.

00:20:38.326 --> 00:20:39.911
Go on. Hurry.

00:20:41.621 --> 00:20:42.497
Hey!

00:20:53.299 --> 00:20:54.467
Damn it.

00:20:59.472 --> 00:21:01.307
You want to die, right?

00:21:01.599 --> 00:21:04.644
Both Seung-kwon and I
put our lives on the line.

00:21:05.853 --> 00:21:09.274
Your life means nothing to me.

00:21:11.192 --> 00:21:12.151
Crazy bastard.

00:21:18.908 --> 00:21:19.784
Boss!

00:21:20.034 --> 00:21:21.119
You fucking asshole!

00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:26.958
What now, you bastard?

00:21:44.142 --> 00:21:45.184
Today,

00:21:48.396 --> 00:21:49.439
it all ends.

00:22:00.491 --> 00:22:01.576
You fucking bastard.

00:22:06.414 --> 00:22:07.790
Die!

00:22:08.291 --> 00:22:11.252
Die just like your father!

00:22:17.342 --> 00:22:20.053
How can you still call yourself human?

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:38.279
Yi-seo, Geun-soo, Ho-jin,

00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:40.323
and my dad.

00:22:43.326 --> 00:22:45.411
Do you feel no guilt at all?

00:22:48.456 --> 00:22:50.416
Do you feel guilty

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.377
when you eat livestock?

00:22:53.294 --> 00:22:54.295
What?

00:22:54.379 --> 00:22:56.506
Because of you livestock,

00:22:58.132 --> 00:22:59.217
I lost everything.

00:23:00.134 --> 00:23:01.177
"Guilt"?

00:23:01.969 --> 00:23:03.221
Cut the bullshit.

00:23:03.304 --> 00:23:06.224
-You fucking asshole!
-Shut up, you jerk!

00:23:16.651 --> 00:23:17.985
Die, you piece of shit!

00:23:18.945 --> 00:23:19.946
Die! Just die already!

00:23:20.029 --> 00:23:20.988
Stop. Wait.

00:23:24.784 --> 00:23:26.119
I can't beat you.

00:23:26.828 --> 00:23:28.162
I lost.

00:23:33.376 --> 00:23:34.544
Saeroyi offered me a way out,

00:23:35.211 --> 00:23:36.629
so let me just leave quietly.

00:23:43.511 --> 00:23:45.179
What about your guys?

00:23:47.265 --> 00:23:48.349
What about them?

00:23:48.975 --> 00:23:50.768
Look at me.

00:23:50.852 --> 00:23:53.354
I can't even take care of myself.

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:56.482
I'll leave them here for now--

00:23:56.566 --> 00:23:57.525
Stop.

00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:02.405
Stop talking.

00:24:07.368 --> 00:24:09.787
You're starting to make me regret

00:24:11.456 --> 00:24:13.207
having worked for you.

00:24:17.211 --> 00:24:18.379
A true boss

00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:21.549
is someone who takes responsibility.

00:24:28.097 --> 00:24:29.015
Die!

00:24:29.599 --> 00:24:30.767
Go to hell!

00:25:03.883 --> 00:25:06.427
Wait. Over there. Please pull over.

00:25:44.837 --> 00:25:47.632
Just die, you zombie.

00:25:53.346 --> 00:25:55.390
I'm no longer the man I used to be.

00:25:59.352 --> 00:26:00.687
Just remember one thing.

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:03.815
If you die,

00:26:04.816 --> 00:26:05.984
I'll die too.

00:26:09.445 --> 00:26:10.738
I can't let it happen.

00:26:12.115 --> 00:26:13.491
I can feel it.

00:26:15.201 --> 00:26:16.786
What crap are you talking about?

00:26:18.955 --> 00:26:20.206
I think

00:26:21.416 --> 00:26:23.251
I will be happy.

00:26:25.586 --> 00:26:26.796
That's not going to happen.

00:26:32.343 --> 00:26:33.511
Damn it!

00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:38.308
Damn, what was that?

00:26:40.226 --> 00:26:41.477
It's okay.

00:27:13.676 --> 00:27:15.428
I sometimes wonder

00:27:16.304 --> 00:27:18.222
if there's really any point in living.

00:27:19.807 --> 00:27:21.601
Life is just so pointless

00:27:22.143 --> 00:27:22.977
and obvious.

00:27:24.228 --> 00:27:25.438
What are you talking about?

00:27:27.231 --> 00:27:31.277
We all grow old and die one day
before we even turn 100.

00:27:31.903 --> 00:27:35.198
But we all try so hard
to live a decent life.

00:27:37.533 --> 00:27:40.244
It would've been nice
if was never born in the first place.

00:27:41.913 --> 00:27:43.164
It feels like such a chore.

00:27:45.166 --> 00:27:46.584
If it feels that much like a chore,

00:27:48.961 --> 00:27:49.837
just die.

00:27:51.631 --> 00:27:52.507
What?

00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:54.050
I guess you're not that clever.

00:27:55.051 --> 00:27:57.303
You talk as if you're some kind of a god.

00:28:00.181 --> 00:28:03.559
Every night after work,
I go for a run in the neighborhood.

00:28:04.894 --> 00:28:07.438
And when I wake up tomorrow,
I'll open the restaurant

00:28:07.522 --> 00:28:10.358
and spend the day working there again.

00:28:12.443 --> 00:28:14.237
Your life might seem repetitive.

00:28:15.446 --> 00:28:18.991
But no one really knows
what could happen tomorrow.

00:28:21.369 --> 00:28:24.038
Seung-kwon once tried
to start a fight with me,

00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:26.582
but now he's a waiter at DanBam.

00:28:26.666 --> 00:28:30.378
You made my pub get suspended,
but now you're the manager.

00:28:31.838 --> 00:28:33.923
Not a single day was predictable for me.

00:28:35.299 --> 00:28:40.054
Some days were tough,
and some days were sad.

00:28:41.806 --> 00:28:45.810
But something fun always came along
every once in a while.

00:28:49.313 --> 00:28:51.482
It's been happening a lot more often
ever since you came.

00:28:54.527 --> 00:28:56.320
Every day is full of excitement.

00:29:02.034 --> 00:29:03.244
Who knows?

00:29:03.786 --> 00:29:05.037
One day,

00:29:05.121 --> 00:29:09.333
your boring life might
turn into an exciting one.

00:29:14.213 --> 00:29:15.882
It's cold. Let's go.

00:29:18.926 --> 00:29:19.969
Me too.

00:29:25.558 --> 00:29:27.268
When I'm with you,

00:29:28.644 --> 00:29:30.021
my heart beats

00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:32.273
and it's fun.

00:29:44.076 --> 00:29:45.077
I did it.

00:29:48.039 --> 00:29:49.165
It's all done now.

00:30:10.686 --> 00:30:11.646
Boss!

00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:19.153
You are okay...

00:30:22.657 --> 00:30:23.616
Let's be

00:30:32.833 --> 00:30:34.043
let's be happy.

00:31:35.479 --> 00:31:39.025
PROSECUTION

00:31:46.907 --> 00:31:51.245
The prosecution carried out
a thorough search of Jangga Co.

00:31:51.329 --> 00:31:53.414
for bribery, embezzlement,
and slush fund creation.

00:31:54.373 --> 00:31:57.960
Chairman Jang Dae-hee is forbidden
from leaving the country.

00:31:58.210 --> 00:32:01.380
And he will be summoned
for investigation within this week.

00:32:02.548 --> 00:32:06.719
Based on the seized data
from the offices of Jangga Co.,

00:32:06.802 --> 00:32:09.597
the prosecution will focus
on grasping the size and flow

00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:12.475
of the embezzlement and slush fund.

00:32:56.102 --> 00:32:57.895
A connection with gangsters.

00:32:58.479 --> 00:33:00.189
Incitement to commit murder. Kidnapping.

00:33:01.357 --> 00:33:04.151
Also, Ms. Oh blew the whistle

00:33:05.653 --> 00:33:09.657
and disclosed the embezzlement,
bribery, and other irregularities.

00:33:10.741 --> 00:33:12.785
There's going to be a search and seizure.

00:33:13.619 --> 00:33:14.912
There's no way out of this.

00:33:18.791 --> 00:33:19.625
I think

00:33:21.419 --> 00:33:22.712
you'll also have to attend.

00:33:25.381 --> 00:33:27.466
I'll take the blame for everything.

00:33:30.511 --> 00:33:32.263
Anything else?

00:33:35.933 --> 00:33:36.976
Mr. Kim.

00:33:41.647 --> 00:33:42.857
The pub owners

00:33:44.650 --> 00:33:48.028
wish to cancel the contract
and receive compensation.

00:33:48.112 --> 00:33:49.363
The Olympics will be held soon.

00:33:51.115 --> 00:33:53.659
We just need to wait until then--

00:33:53.743 --> 00:33:55.536
The company is on the brink of bankruptcy.

00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:01.459
And the board is considering the option
of selling the company.

00:34:03.210 --> 00:34:04.044
What?

00:34:05.212 --> 00:34:06.297
What are you talking about?

00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:07.423
If we sell now,

00:34:12.344 --> 00:34:13.512
we'll gain absolutely nothing.

00:34:13.888 --> 00:34:15.431
Have they lost their minds?

00:34:17.349 --> 00:34:19.602
There's one firm that offered to take over

00:34:21.353 --> 00:34:22.480
at a pretty reasonable price.

00:34:29.403 --> 00:34:31.697
CHUNGCHEONG PRISON

00:34:35.826 --> 00:34:40.080
LET'S BUILD MORALITY
AND LIVE HEALTHY LIVES

00:34:46.587 --> 00:34:47.922
You seem familiar.

00:34:49.131 --> 00:34:50.216
I'm Lee Ho-jin.

00:34:51.967 --> 00:34:52.968
"Lee Ho-jin"?

00:34:55.054 --> 00:34:56.889
I'm a financial manager for IC Co.

00:34:57.681 --> 00:34:59.016
Before that, I used to be

00:34:59.099 --> 00:35:01.894
the financial manager
for Director Kang Min-jung.

00:35:02.561 --> 00:35:03.896
And before that,

00:35:06.065 --> 00:35:08.192
I was a Senior in class one
at Gwangjin Highschool.

00:35:09.193 --> 00:35:10.736
You bullied me.

00:35:16.784 --> 00:35:17.785
What...

00:35:19.286 --> 00:35:20.204
That nerd?

00:35:20.955 --> 00:35:22.873
How could you forget me?

00:35:24.041 --> 00:35:26.252
The whole thing between Saeroyi and you
started with me.

00:35:28.003 --> 00:35:28.879
You...

00:35:28.963 --> 00:35:29.922
Did you...

00:35:30.005 --> 00:35:31.966
And I get to wrap things up too.

00:35:33.467 --> 00:35:34.718
What are you talking about?

00:35:36.387 --> 00:35:38.764
There will be a takeover bid
for Jangga Co.

00:35:41.642 --> 00:35:43.352
Takeover?

00:35:44.061 --> 00:35:47.147
Those days you don't even remember...

00:35:48.607 --> 00:35:50.192
"Jang Geun-won is the law."

00:35:50.776 --> 00:35:54.113
You could say that
as Jangga Co. had your back.

00:35:55.573 --> 00:35:58.033
I wanted to see you
without your background.

00:35:58.659 --> 00:36:00.911
All the corruption of Chairman Jang
has been revealed.

00:36:00.995 --> 00:36:02.371
He will soon be arrested.

00:36:04.623 --> 00:36:06.083
How dare you...

00:36:17.678 --> 00:36:19.179
Stop whining.

00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:22.349
You...

00:36:22.433 --> 00:36:23.475
It's done.

00:36:27.730 --> 00:36:28.898
I forgive you.

00:36:32.985 --> 00:36:33.903
Hey, Lee Ho-jin.

00:36:35.487 --> 00:36:36.322
You moron.

00:36:36.989 --> 00:36:38.115
Lee Ho-jin!

00:36:38.198 --> 00:36:39.742
You idiot!

00:36:39.825 --> 00:36:41.035
Damn it!

00:36:41.118 --> 00:36:42.661
Hey!

00:36:42.745 --> 00:36:45.456
Let go of me. Lee Ho-jin!

00:36:48.751 --> 00:36:50.002
Min-jung.

00:36:51.795 --> 00:36:52.922
Hey.

00:36:56.175 --> 00:36:57.551
Where are you going?

00:36:57.718 --> 00:36:58.677
Seoul.

00:36:59.053 --> 00:37:00.679
I have something to take care of.

00:37:01.263 --> 00:37:03.140
I'm going back to the head office.

00:37:03.223 --> 00:37:06.060
I see. That's a bummer.

00:37:06.143 --> 00:37:07.227
Right?

00:37:09.396 --> 00:37:10.898
I won't

00:37:10.981 --> 00:37:12.650
get to see you often then.

00:37:13.442 --> 00:37:15.861
It depends on you.

00:37:15.945 --> 00:37:18.238
You can visit me when you come to Seoul.

00:37:24.203 --> 00:37:26.538
How could I do that?

00:37:29.208 --> 00:37:30.209
You can't?

00:37:30.751 --> 00:37:32.544
Then you won't get to see me.

00:37:33.295 --> 00:37:35.464
You are so lame.

00:37:37.424 --> 00:37:39.426
I'll see you later, Hye-won. Bye.

00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:40.594
Bye!

00:37:42.805 --> 00:37:43.806
Well...

00:37:44.431 --> 00:37:45.599
Director Kang.

00:37:46.558 --> 00:37:49.520
You're not my employee.
Why do you call me like that?

00:37:49.603 --> 00:37:51.480
You can call me by my name.

00:37:52.523 --> 00:37:53.482
Okay.

00:37:54.024 --> 00:37:54.984
Ms. Min-jung.

00:37:55.067 --> 00:37:56.360
My goodness.

00:37:58.696 --> 00:38:01.365
What was that? It's funny, isn't it?

00:38:03.367 --> 00:38:04.368
Can I

00:38:04.994 --> 00:38:07.162
give you a ride?

00:38:07.246 --> 00:38:09.289
She'll be a lot more
comfortable in that car.

00:38:09.373 --> 00:38:10.582
Stay quiet.

00:38:10.666 --> 00:38:12.793
The truck is too small for three people.

00:38:13.669 --> 00:38:14.712
Well...

00:38:23.554 --> 00:38:24.763
I will just squeeze in.

00:38:26.807 --> 00:38:29.643
You go on ahead.
I'll be there in that truck.

00:38:29.727 --> 00:38:31.061
Yes, ma'am.

00:38:32.396 --> 00:38:33.647
Let's go.

00:38:33.731 --> 00:38:34.565
Please get in.

00:38:47.995 --> 00:38:50.247
JANGGA PUB, JANGGA NOODLES,
JANGGA RESTAURANT

00:38:50.330 --> 00:38:51.707
A whistle blower.

00:38:53.417 --> 00:38:55.335
No one would want to hire you.

00:38:57.463 --> 00:38:58.672
Why did you do that?

00:39:01.216 --> 00:39:02.760
What about you?

00:39:03.385 --> 00:39:05.929
Why do you try so hard

00:39:06.638 --> 00:39:08.474
for Jangga Co. and Chairman Jang?

00:39:10.225 --> 00:39:11.101
Do you not know why?

00:39:14.271 --> 00:39:15.105
I'm

00:39:16.899 --> 00:39:18.150
a salaryman.

00:39:23.572 --> 00:39:25.991
I've learned a lot from you.

00:39:42.841 --> 00:39:45.636
There's no way

00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:48.055
that little brat can run Jangga Co.

00:39:49.348 --> 00:39:51.517
Please help me this once.

00:39:53.310 --> 00:39:54.144
Mr. Hwang.

00:39:59.233 --> 00:40:00.484
What about the Mayor?

00:40:02.152 --> 00:40:03.112
I can't reach him.

00:40:05.197 --> 00:40:06.281
These old bats.

00:40:07.658 --> 00:40:10.452
Only six months ago,
they were intimidated by me.

00:40:10.953 --> 00:40:11.912
Damn it.

00:40:13.372 --> 00:40:14.289
There is

00:40:15.874 --> 00:40:16.917
nothing we can do now.

00:40:18.961 --> 00:40:20.587
-Are you saying--
-Chairman Jang.

00:40:21.046 --> 00:40:22.172
I mean,

00:40:24.758 --> 00:40:25.634
Dad.

00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:31.682
You know your favorite saying.

00:40:34.059 --> 00:40:35.477
"The strong prey on the weak."

00:40:37.604 --> 00:40:38.647
It's just like that.

00:40:40.315 --> 00:40:41.358
We got weak,

00:40:43.485 --> 00:40:44.570
so they are preying.

00:40:54.705 --> 00:40:55.539
Get out.

00:41:21.315 --> 00:41:22.524
That's ridiculous.

00:41:24.401 --> 00:41:25.694
I'm Jang Dae-hee.

00:41:26.528 --> 00:41:27.738
This is Jangga Co.

00:41:28.822 --> 00:41:29.656
No.

00:41:30.407 --> 00:41:31.783
It can never happen.

00:41:32.910 --> 00:41:34.369
Does this make sense to you?

00:41:34.453 --> 00:41:36.622
An ex-convict
who barely finished middle school?

00:41:36.705 --> 00:41:38.457
I tried to put up with all that.

00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:39.833
Mom, please.

00:41:39.917 --> 00:41:43.420
And now what? Kidnap? She got kidnapped?

00:41:45.631 --> 00:41:46.965
I'm really sorry.

00:41:48.175 --> 00:41:49.343
I can't take this anymore.

00:41:49.426 --> 00:41:52.804
I knew it all along when he stopped you
from going to college.

00:41:52.888 --> 00:41:55.933
How would I trust you with my daughter
when you're like this?

00:41:57.184 --> 00:42:01.396
I'm really sorry. I'll make sure
it will never happen again.

00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:02.981
You have to.

00:42:03.065 --> 00:42:06.109
I will watch you closely.

00:42:06.193 --> 00:42:07.778
Make sure to take good care of her.

00:42:07.861 --> 00:42:09.613
Sure. I will take...

00:42:13.533 --> 00:42:14.785
Yes, ma'am.

00:42:18.372 --> 00:42:21.208
Mom. We have to go. You should go.

00:42:22.834 --> 00:42:23.877
Okay.

00:42:24.544 --> 00:42:26.838
All right then. I hope you'll get better.

00:42:26.964 --> 00:42:28.048
See you.

00:42:28.632 --> 00:42:30.759
Thank you, Mother. Take care.

00:42:36.014 --> 00:42:37.099
"Mother?"

00:42:40.519 --> 00:42:41.520
Yes.

00:42:47.276 --> 00:42:48.527
It's nice to hear.

00:42:49.486 --> 00:42:50.404
Go, Mom.

00:42:51.446 --> 00:42:52.447
Bye.

00:42:58.161 --> 00:43:00.080
Wait, my legs.

00:43:02.332 --> 00:43:05.460
I clearly heard you say
you'd take care of me.

00:43:05.794 --> 00:43:06.628
What?

00:43:13.427 --> 00:43:14.970
You know I'm not just a talker.

00:43:17.472 --> 00:43:18.765
What?

00:43:22.811 --> 00:43:24.187
Do you like me?

00:43:27.941 --> 00:43:29.276
No, I love you.

00:43:37.451 --> 00:43:38.535
Let's go.

00:43:41.121 --> 00:43:42.873
What? I didn't hear you. Say that again.

00:43:42.956 --> 00:43:44.082
Say what?

00:43:44.791 --> 00:43:46.335
What you just said.

00:43:49.629 --> 00:43:51.214
I love you. Let's go.

00:43:52.174 --> 00:43:53.133
I love you too.

00:43:59.973 --> 00:44:02.225
Didn't I tell you I'm upset with you?

00:44:02.309 --> 00:44:03.143
I know.

00:44:04.269 --> 00:44:07.647
I did get on your nerves

00:44:08.732 --> 00:44:10.692
because of Park Saeroyi.

00:44:11.610 --> 00:44:14.154
Like you asked, I promise

00:44:15.113 --> 00:44:17.366
I won't mess with him again.

00:44:19.409 --> 00:44:21.578
Let me get this straight.

00:44:22.412 --> 00:44:24.539
It's not that you won't mess with him.

00:44:24.956 --> 00:44:27.167
You just can't do it anymore.

00:44:29.586 --> 00:44:32.714
We've known each other

00:44:33.340 --> 00:44:34.633
for over 40 years.

00:44:34.716 --> 00:44:36.176
Why did you call me?

00:44:38.345 --> 00:44:39.971
I don't know if you're aware of it,

00:44:41.848 --> 00:44:42.724
but I don't

00:44:43.517 --> 00:44:45.310
have long to live.

00:44:52.025 --> 00:44:55.612
I could build Jangga Co.
into a major company thanks to you.

00:44:56.196 --> 00:44:57.823
I can't ruin it just like this.

00:44:58.490 --> 00:44:59.950
If you give me one more chance--

00:45:00.033 --> 00:45:01.743
Is it because of me?

00:45:02.869 --> 00:45:04.538
You told me this before.

00:45:05.205 --> 00:45:08.542
You started your business
to feed your family.

00:45:10.252 --> 00:45:12.879
Do you still feel the same way?

00:45:14.381 --> 00:45:15.340
Sure.

00:45:15.632 --> 00:45:16.800
I really do.

00:45:16.883 --> 00:45:18.343
Then let me ask you one thing.

00:45:18.427 --> 00:45:21.138
If Park Saeroyi leads Jangga Co.,

00:45:21.221 --> 00:45:23.723
will your family starve to death?

00:45:26.101 --> 00:45:27.352
Why do you

00:45:28.019 --> 00:45:29.646
run your business now?

00:45:35.193 --> 00:45:38.613
I've never made you suffer a loss.

00:45:40.031 --> 00:45:41.825
If you help me this once--

00:45:41.908 --> 00:45:42.784
For you,

00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:47.497
we've been together for mutual advantages.

00:45:49.082 --> 00:45:50.876
It just goes away

00:45:50.959 --> 00:45:53.253
once you lose your value.

00:45:56.673 --> 00:45:58.049
Please don't be like this.

00:45:59.009 --> 00:46:00.469
What should I do now?

00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:02.762
It can't be helped.

00:46:04.014 --> 00:46:05.807
You shouldn't be

00:46:05.891 --> 00:46:07.726
clinging onto me.

00:46:08.393 --> 00:46:10.437
-Ms. Kim.
-There's someone else

00:46:11.313 --> 00:46:12.731
who can take care of things.

00:46:22.157 --> 00:46:25.577
DANBAM

00:46:47.599 --> 00:46:49.684
Welcome to Danbam.

00:47:01.404 --> 00:47:04.908
Who is he? Why did Mr. Park come
all the way here to serve him food?

00:47:04.991 --> 00:47:07.077
I know. Ms. Jo is here too.

00:47:07.827 --> 00:47:09.162
He looks familiar though.

00:47:46.741 --> 00:47:48.034
Soft tofu stew?

00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:50.954
Please try it.

00:48:53.558 --> 00:48:55.477
I'm pursuing the takeover of Jangga Co.

00:49:04.694 --> 00:49:07.864
I'm planning to let
Director Kang run the company.

00:49:08.782 --> 00:49:11.034
Since the company reputation is tarnished,

00:49:12.827 --> 00:49:15.163
and I have hard feelings
toward the company name,

00:49:15.622 --> 00:49:18.166
I'm going to change it.

00:49:27.217 --> 00:49:28.134
This stew.

00:49:29.761 --> 00:49:31.262
Where did you learn it from?

00:49:35.183 --> 00:49:36.184
From my father.

00:49:38.186 --> 00:49:39.312
Mr. Park?

00:49:46.319 --> 00:49:47.904
I thought it tasted similar.

00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:51.157
But this one has a unique aftertaste.

00:49:52.450 --> 00:49:54.744
We have our own recipe for the sauce.

00:49:54.828 --> 00:49:55.954
I give

00:49:56.996 --> 00:49:59.666
a lot of care to fermented soybean powder.

00:50:00.667 --> 00:50:01.543
A lot of care?

00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:04.921
On a cold day,

00:50:06.131 --> 00:50:08.091
the warmth spreads throughout the body.

00:50:08.925 --> 00:50:10.093
Isn't it good?

00:50:25.024 --> 00:50:25.900
I agree.

00:50:35.869 --> 00:50:38.496
I got treated with a nice meal like this.

00:50:40.039 --> 00:50:40.957
But I'm sorry

00:50:42.917 --> 00:50:44.419
I didn't bring any money.

00:50:51.676 --> 00:50:52.552
This is embarrassing.

00:50:56.681 --> 00:50:58.516
Can I pay in another way?

00:52:22.100 --> 00:52:23.476
What are you doing?

00:52:29.274 --> 00:52:31.484
Jangga Co. is collapsing already.

00:52:33.319 --> 00:52:34.696
There would be no advantage

00:52:36.030 --> 00:52:37.448
in taking over the company.

00:52:40.159 --> 00:52:42.245
This is all my fault.

00:52:45.081 --> 00:52:46.624
This isn't just about resentment.

00:52:48.126 --> 00:52:50.628
Jangga Co. is a good company.

00:52:58.595 --> 00:53:00.805
I don't have many days to live.

00:53:02.098 --> 00:53:04.142
I'm not doing this for my own good.

00:53:07.061 --> 00:53:08.062
I apologize

00:53:08.813 --> 00:53:09.939
with all my heart.

00:53:14.110 --> 00:53:15.778
I've done terrible things

00:53:18.865 --> 00:53:20.491
to Mr. Park and you.

00:53:21.409 --> 00:53:22.744
I'm deeply sorry.

00:53:41.220 --> 00:53:43.264
Please forgive me.

00:54:42.949 --> 00:54:44.742
I've always wanted this to happen,

00:54:45.994 --> 00:54:47.745
but it doesn't feel great.

00:55:03.678 --> 00:55:05.179
I feel bad for Geun-soo.

00:55:07.181 --> 00:55:08.599
Please get up.

00:55:16.941 --> 00:55:17.942
Saeroyi.

00:55:27.952 --> 00:55:29.245
Do you think

00:55:36.335 --> 00:55:37.628
I'm a pushover?

00:55:41.841 --> 00:55:42.675
What?

00:55:46.429 --> 00:55:47.263
I'm

00:55:48.639 --> 00:55:50.016
a businessman.

00:55:55.563 --> 00:55:56.898
This is about a business takeover.

00:55:56.981 --> 00:55:58.775
You just apologized
after losing everything.

00:55:59.984 --> 00:56:01.652
What good would it do me?

00:56:13.790 --> 00:56:15.041
Let's do business,

00:56:16.584 --> 00:56:17.752
Chairman Jang.

00:57:20.731 --> 00:57:24.402
The IC Co. will take over

00:57:24.485 --> 00:57:26.988
Jangga Co.

00:57:27.613 --> 00:57:29.866
Then, Mr. Park Saeroyi,
please say something for us.

00:57:36.622 --> 00:57:41.085
THE 32ND SHAREHOLDERS MEETING
OF JANGGA CO.

00:57:57.727 --> 00:58:00.980
Hello, I'm Park Saeroyi,
IC Co. representative.

00:58:03.566 --> 00:58:07.028
Jangga Co. is a restaurant company
representing Korea.

00:58:08.654 --> 00:58:10.781
There is also a menu
that represents this Jangga Co.

00:58:11.282 --> 00:58:15.328
Gochujang seasoned pork bulgogi
and its seasoning.

00:58:16.537 --> 00:58:19.999
The crisis in the country,
the days when everyone was in trouble,

00:58:20.082 --> 00:58:23.878
It comforted the people
with its low price and delicious taste.

00:58:24.962 --> 00:58:28.591
The recent events
have cracked the corporate image,

00:58:29.592 --> 00:58:31.052
but it's just an individual's fault.

00:58:31.719 --> 00:58:34.764
Jangga Co. is still a good restaurant.

00:58:35.348 --> 00:58:38.267
At that time,
it was not only money and gain

00:58:38.851 --> 00:58:41.812
that Jangga Co. sought.

00:58:43.147 --> 00:58:44.815
The most important things in business.

00:58:45.691 --> 00:58:46.567
People.

00:58:47.235 --> 00:58:48.277
Trust.

00:58:49.570 --> 00:58:51.489
I will value people and not money.

00:58:52.490 --> 00:58:54.951
I will value trust then gains.

00:58:57.161 --> 00:58:58.329
With all of you,

00:58:59.538 --> 00:59:00.456
we will renew

00:59:01.082 --> 00:59:02.959
and prosper again.

00:59:03.042 --> 00:59:04.168
Thank you.

00:59:36.534 --> 00:59:38.202
Congratulations on your wish fulfillment.

00:59:38.286 --> 00:59:39.412
Thank you.

00:59:39.495 --> 00:59:40.663
Congratulations.

00:59:40.746 --> 00:59:41.872
Congratulations.

00:59:44.542 --> 00:59:45.835
Geun-soo.

00:59:55.845 --> 00:59:57.013
I heard you resigned.

00:59:59.432 --> 01:00:00.975
A defeated soldier must retreat.

01:00:03.227 --> 01:00:05.896
It might have been uncomfortable today
but you voted for me.

01:00:07.189 --> 01:00:08.482
Why did you do that?

01:00:10.401 --> 01:00:11.694
Is my vote meaningful?

01:00:13.321 --> 01:00:14.196
I just...

01:00:15.614 --> 01:00:16.782
I wanted to see it.

01:00:19.785 --> 01:00:21.329
You achieved your goal.

01:00:24.332 --> 01:00:26.792
I will not harm you
for your father's deeds.

01:00:28.502 --> 01:00:30.463
-One day with your abilities--
-It was me.

01:00:34.508 --> 01:00:35.843
I told the reporters

01:00:38.971 --> 01:00:40.139
about Hyun-yi.

01:00:51.942 --> 01:00:52.860
In addition to that,

01:00:55.821 --> 01:00:57.490
I approached Seung-kwon

01:00:58.199 --> 01:00:59.909
to figure out the IC's movements.

01:01:03.788 --> 01:01:05.206
It wasn't the right clothes.

01:01:09.126 --> 01:01:10.419
I did everything I could

01:01:11.295 --> 01:01:12.588
to win.

01:01:15.633 --> 01:01:17.009
I knew from the beginning

01:01:19.220 --> 01:01:21.180
that I wouldn't be able to get Yi-seo

01:01:23.015 --> 01:01:24.183
even if I took over Jangga Co.

01:01:29.647 --> 01:01:31.399
I knew everything but I couldn't stop.

01:01:33.901 --> 01:01:36.529
I didn't know how to stop..

01:01:45.788 --> 01:01:46.872
My heart...

01:01:47.832 --> 01:01:48.999
It's okay.

01:01:54.088 --> 01:01:55.297
Because you are just a kiddie.

01:01:58.926 --> 01:02:00.136
Come and eat from time to time.

01:02:24.452 --> 01:02:27.079
OH SOO-AH

01:02:29.832 --> 01:02:30.749
Hello.

01:02:32.751 --> 01:02:35.212
I heard. I wanted to congratulate you.

01:02:37.256 --> 01:02:38.549
A whistleblower.

01:02:39.842 --> 01:02:40.759
Why did you do that?

01:02:42.678 --> 01:02:43.804
It's not because of you.

01:02:45.931 --> 01:02:46.765
What?

01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:49.518
When I borrowed money

01:02:51.187 --> 01:02:52.897
for college from your dad,

01:02:54.398 --> 01:02:56.233
I told him I would pay him three times.

01:02:59.737 --> 01:03:00.779
Is this

01:03:02.573 --> 01:03:03.824
enough?

01:03:08.037 --> 01:03:08.913
Yes.

01:03:10.164 --> 01:03:11.081
Thank you.

01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:19.298
Now I can comfortably

01:03:20.716 --> 01:03:22.176
live my life.

01:03:27.431 --> 01:03:28.432
As a friend,

01:03:29.558 --> 01:03:30.559
can you cheer for me?

01:03:37.691 --> 01:03:38.776
I will always cheer for you.

01:03:48.953 --> 01:03:50.621
Now that your revenge is over,

01:03:52.498 --> 01:03:54.166
can I ask you a favor?

01:03:56.335 --> 01:03:57.253
What is it?

01:04:02.258 --> 01:04:03.467
Live

01:04:05.052 --> 01:04:05.970
happily.

01:04:13.185 --> 01:04:14.270
I will.

01:04:58.230 --> 01:05:00.774
DANBAM

01:05:05.988 --> 01:05:10.117
Do you want me to come with you?

01:05:13.579 --> 01:05:14.455
What?

01:05:15.372 --> 01:05:16.832
What are you doing here?

01:05:16.915 --> 01:05:18.459
Geun-soo called me here.

01:05:18.542 --> 01:05:19.627
-He called you too?
-Yes.

01:05:20.252 --> 01:05:21.253
Hello.

01:05:22.671 --> 01:05:23.839
Why is he so depressed?

01:05:25.507 --> 01:05:27.343
He got dumped by his girlfriend.

01:05:28.052 --> 01:05:31.013
Hey, it's no big deal.

01:05:31.096 --> 01:05:33.140
Do you know how I feel?

01:05:33.223 --> 01:05:34.642
You don't even have a girlfriend.

01:05:36.894 --> 01:05:38.604
He's right. You don't.

01:05:41.565 --> 01:05:42.816
What is this?

01:05:43.067 --> 01:05:44.109
Movie tickets?

01:05:46.236 --> 01:05:47.571
You can take it.

01:05:47.655 --> 01:05:49.281
I don't need it anymore.

01:05:49.365 --> 01:05:51.367
Gosh, Toni.

01:05:53.619 --> 01:05:54.828
What?

01:05:56.542 --> 01:05:58.002
Oh...Hi.

01:06:02.464 --> 01:06:04.091
-Hi. Welcome.
-Hi.

01:06:04.174 --> 01:06:06.010
-Is it just the two of you?
-Yes.

01:06:06.101 --> 01:06:07.686
Would you prefer a table with the view?

01:06:07.761 --> 01:06:08.887
Yes, please.

01:06:09.471 --> 01:06:10.764
Right this way.

01:06:13.055 --> 01:06:14.014
Hey.

01:06:14.348 --> 01:06:16.225
Did he just speak English?

01:06:16.308 --> 01:06:17.643
Yes, he learned it.

01:06:17.726 --> 01:06:19.561
That was his homework from our boss.

01:06:20.145 --> 01:06:21.939
What? It's Geun-soo.

01:06:33.367 --> 01:06:35.160
Please forgive me.

01:06:38.872 --> 01:06:39.832
Raise your head.

01:06:49.049 --> 01:06:52.052
You stabbed us in the back,
so we're paying it back.

01:06:55.764 --> 01:06:57.558
Did you hit him hard?

01:06:58.475 --> 01:06:59.810
Did I?

01:07:00.978 --> 01:07:01.854
Hey, are you...

01:07:06.358 --> 01:07:09.194
I guess you didn't hit him right.

01:07:10.362 --> 01:07:11.613
Why did you do such a thing

01:07:11.697 --> 01:07:13.490
when you would feel bad about it?

01:07:15.784 --> 01:07:16.952
I'm sorry.

01:07:18.954 --> 01:07:21.749
Yi-seo is coming today.
Make sure to see her before you leave.

01:07:26.253 --> 01:07:27.129
Maybe next time.

01:07:28.380 --> 01:07:29.548
I'll see her later.

01:07:29.631 --> 01:07:31.550
Why don't you stay here and see her?

01:07:33.802 --> 01:07:34.803
I'm

01:07:36.221 --> 01:07:37.264
still a kiddie.

01:08:07.669 --> 01:08:08.754
What are you doing here?

01:08:09.838 --> 01:08:10.839
Well...

01:08:13.675 --> 01:08:15.135
I'm going to the States.

01:08:17.721 --> 01:08:20.599
I wanted to apologize
to Seung-kwon and Hyun-yi before I leave.

01:08:24.269 --> 01:08:27.356
Do you feel better this way?

01:08:28.690 --> 01:08:31.485
Saying sorry won't just cut it.

01:08:36.114 --> 01:08:37.241
I know.

01:08:38.867 --> 01:08:39.785
Bye.

01:08:40.452 --> 01:08:41.620
Take care.

01:08:46.166 --> 01:08:47.251
Yi-seo.

01:08:55.509 --> 01:08:56.760
What about

01:08:57.553 --> 01:08:58.428
a handshake?

01:09:02.057 --> 01:09:04.268
Is it something like an ending

01:09:05.227 --> 01:09:06.228
of your long crush?

01:09:07.980 --> 01:09:08.897
Well...

01:09:12.192 --> 01:09:13.110
I know.

01:09:14.111 --> 01:09:15.404
I don't deserve it.

01:09:22.619 --> 01:09:23.662
Of course,

01:09:24.663 --> 01:09:25.622
you do.

01:09:28.709 --> 01:09:31.670
You didn't even care
about right and wrong.

01:09:33.422 --> 01:09:34.715
You were just faithful to me.

01:09:36.466 --> 01:09:37.885
I couldn't accept it,

01:09:39.553 --> 01:09:40.846
but I could feel it all.

01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:45.767
I'm sorry I took advantage of it.

01:09:48.312 --> 01:09:49.479
And thank you.

01:10:07.748 --> 01:10:08.749
Take care.

01:10:58.006 --> 01:10:59.508
-Is this it?
-Yes.

01:10:59.758 --> 01:11:02.594
This place is popular these days.
I'm here to spy on it.

01:11:04.972 --> 01:11:08.308
You don't have to spy on me.
Just ask me if you have questions.

01:11:10.394 --> 01:11:12.896
-The owner is pretty.
-Oh...

01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:14.564
Is this yours?

01:11:16.149 --> 01:11:18.527
I recently opened it
with Seok-cheon's investment.

01:11:19.861 --> 01:11:20.862
Go ahead and spy.

01:11:20.946 --> 01:11:22.197
Come on in.

01:11:22.322 --> 01:11:23.240
I'll buy you some tea.

01:11:25.742 --> 01:11:26.702
You know what?

01:11:30.539 --> 01:11:32.124
Boss and I are dating.

01:11:44.261 --> 01:11:45.429
I'm just relieved if it's you.

01:11:48.432 --> 01:11:50.642
Take good care of Saeroyi.

01:11:54.312 --> 01:11:56.148
What? How nosy.

01:11:56.648 --> 01:11:57.649
Why do you even care?

01:11:57.733 --> 01:11:59.776
-Let's just go, Hyun-yi.
-Hey.

01:12:04.114 --> 01:12:05.657
I'll come again next time.

01:12:06.450 --> 01:12:07.909
Hey, wait for me...

01:12:12.998 --> 01:12:13.999
I mean it.

01:12:16.001 --> 01:12:17.169
Take good care of him.

01:12:20.505 --> 01:12:23.258
-That's so...
-Seok-cheon.

01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:25.093
Soo-ah.

01:12:26.178 --> 01:12:27.763
A chef is here for an interview.

01:12:27.846 --> 01:12:29.639
Oh, right. Where is he?

01:12:29.723 --> 01:12:30.891
He's there.

01:12:42.569 --> 01:12:43.487
Hello.

01:12:52.079 --> 01:12:53.163
Amazing.

01:12:54.623 --> 01:12:55.499
Sorry?

01:12:55.582 --> 01:12:56.666
You have to hire him.

01:12:57.793 --> 01:12:58.960
He's stunning.

01:13:01.171 --> 01:13:02.422
Wow.

01:13:02.798 --> 01:13:04.424
How could a chef look like that?

01:13:04.508 --> 01:13:06.218
He should be serving in the hall.

01:13:06.718 --> 01:13:07.928
You'll hire him, right?

01:13:09.846 --> 01:13:11.515
I'll hire him only when he cooks well.

01:13:22.984 --> 01:13:26.029
Please say you like it.
You have to hire him.

01:13:31.243 --> 01:13:32.577
Do you like it?

01:13:41.169 --> 01:13:42.129
Can you

01:13:43.130 --> 01:13:44.422
start tomorrow?

01:13:51.304 --> 01:13:53.140
Yes, Boss.

01:13:55.517 --> 01:13:57.269
I'll come here starting from tomorrow.

01:13:58.228 --> 01:14:00.564
I love it.

01:14:00.772 --> 01:14:01.898
It's delicious.

01:14:02.649 --> 01:14:04.609
Wow, this is amazing.

01:14:11.700 --> 01:14:12.701
What was that?

01:14:13.994 --> 01:14:14.911
You startled me.

01:14:14.995 --> 01:14:17.205
Why did you call me? I'm busy.

01:14:17.831 --> 01:14:19.040
No reason.

01:14:19.916 --> 01:14:21.543
I got free tickets.

01:14:22.294 --> 01:14:23.753
But I didn't want to watch it alone.

01:14:25.213 --> 01:14:29.384
I guess Director Choi has
a lot of free time these days.

01:14:29.968 --> 01:14:32.345
It's not like I can sell these tickets.

01:14:36.516 --> 01:14:38.101
What are you waiting for? Let's go.

01:14:40.312 --> 01:14:41.229
I'm coming.

01:14:41.479 --> 01:14:42.731
Gosh.

01:14:46.443 --> 01:14:47.694
Gosh.

01:14:47.903 --> 01:14:48.820
Hello.

01:15:07.172 --> 01:15:09.132
YI-SEO AND SAEROYI

01:15:17.390 --> 01:15:18.516
What are you doing here?

01:15:24.231 --> 01:15:25.190
Are you busy?

01:15:26.650 --> 01:15:28.026
Why? Is something wrong?

01:15:32.906 --> 01:15:34.157
Not really.

01:15:34.699 --> 01:15:36.368
A cool breeze is blowing outside.

01:15:37.535 --> 01:15:39.246
It's a nice day for a walk.

01:15:39.955 --> 01:15:40.997
If you're not busy,

01:15:41.498 --> 01:15:42.332
can we go out?

01:15:46.628 --> 01:15:47.629
I'm not busy.

01:15:48.213 --> 01:15:51.508
MR. PARK'S SCHEDULE

01:15:52.717 --> 01:15:55.720
I haven't been to Itaewon with you
in such a long time.

01:15:55.804 --> 01:15:58.265
I know. We've been busy.

01:16:03.311 --> 01:16:04.229
-Boss.
-Yes?

01:16:04.312 --> 01:16:05.522
Come here.

01:16:06.106 --> 01:16:07.274
-Okay.
-This place is nice.

01:16:07.357 --> 01:16:08.775
YI-SEO AND SAEROYI

01:16:14.823 --> 01:16:16.658
One, two, three.

01:16:24.374 --> 01:16:25.667
-Do you want me to take it?
-No.

01:16:25.750 --> 01:16:26.584
No?

01:16:27.127 --> 01:16:28.169
Take a picture of me.

01:16:33.341 --> 01:16:35.760
-You said you love me, right?
-What? Yes.

01:16:38.763 --> 01:16:39.639
I did.

01:16:43.059 --> 01:16:43.935
But

01:16:44.853 --> 01:16:46.479
why do you not hold my hand?

01:16:51.109 --> 01:16:52.152
Oh, well...

01:16:54.154 --> 01:16:54.988
It's just...

01:16:57.657 --> 01:16:58.992
It feels a little awkward.

01:17:02.954 --> 01:17:04.164
I feel the same way.

01:17:36.946 --> 01:17:38.073
I'll try my best

01:17:44.204 --> 01:17:45.872
You and I are

01:17:46.915 --> 01:17:48.917
different from A to Z.

01:17:50.168 --> 01:17:51.628
But we have one thing in common.

01:17:54.547 --> 01:17:55.590
One thing in common?

01:17:56.758 --> 01:17:58.051
Yes.

01:18:01.930 --> 01:18:03.598
We don't know the warmth of people.

01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:11.606
When I heard

01:18:12.982 --> 01:18:15.110
about your past the other day,

01:18:19.364 --> 01:18:21.324
I wanted to embrace

01:18:23.243 --> 01:18:25.078
all your painful past.

01:18:27.872 --> 01:18:30.125
I didn't want you to suffer.

01:18:33.128 --> 01:18:34.337
I didn't want you to be lonely.

01:18:41.010 --> 01:18:42.887
I wanted to make

01:18:45.056 --> 01:18:46.891
your bitter night sweet.

01:18:57.152 --> 01:18:58.903
When I think of you,

01:19:01.448 --> 01:19:03.283
my empty life

01:19:06.744 --> 01:19:08.580
fills up with you.

01:19:16.713 --> 01:19:17.797
Thank you.

01:19:25.096 --> 01:19:26.097
I love you.

01:19:29.976 --> 01:19:31.728
I will make you happy.

01:19:57.837 --> 01:19:59.214
I wanted to be happy.

01:20:02.425 --> 01:20:03.760
Without losing myself,

01:20:05.512 --> 01:20:07.597
I wanted to achieve everything I want.

01:20:12.602 --> 01:20:14.062
There were difficult days.

01:20:19.192 --> 01:20:20.151
Sometimes,

01:20:22.987 --> 01:20:24.364
I was nervous and afraid.

01:20:33.831 --> 01:20:35.166
How did I get through all that?

01:20:36.251 --> 01:20:37.293
We can...

01:20:37.377 --> 01:20:38.711
-Do it!
-Do it!

01:20:39.170 --> 01:20:40.672
With my loved ones,

01:20:42.048 --> 01:20:44.634
I've led a hectic life
doing what I want to do.

01:20:45.218 --> 01:20:46.678
-We got this!
-We got this!

01:20:48.054 --> 01:20:49.138
Staying with them.

01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:51.474
Sharing my life

01:20:53.142 --> 01:20:54.143
with them.

01:20:58.856 --> 01:21:00.024
In search of happiness.

01:21:16.124 --> 01:21:17.333
I love you,

01:21:20.003 --> 01:21:20.878
Yi-seo.

01:21:52.869 --> 01:21:54.078
Happiness.

01:22:06.257 --> 01:22:07.800
The warmth I share with you.

01:22:42.043 --> 01:22:43.252
I'm already

01:22:55.848 --> 01:22:57.183
happier than I ever imagined

01:23:01.729 --> 01:23:02.814
I could be.

01:23:30.091 --> 01:23:30.967
Boss

01:23:32.260 --> 01:23:33.344
I love you

01:23:36.764 --> 01:23:37.932
Let's drink.

01:23:38.391 --> 01:23:40.727
Cheers!

01:23:50.987 --> 01:23:52.447
Who wants to go to a club?

01:24:34.363 --> 01:24:35.615
How does it taste?

01:24:48.127 --> 01:24:51.339
AN END-CREDIT SCENE WILL FOLLOW

01:24:51.580 --> 01:24:57.518
Subtitle translation by Ja-won Lee

01:25:26.123 --> 01:25:28.125
I work as usual.

01:25:30.378 --> 01:25:31.504
SPECIAL THANKS TO PARK BO-GUM
AND HONG SEOK-CHEON

01:25:31.587 --> 01:25:32.797
And I date

01:25:34.382 --> 01:25:35.675
as usual.

01:25:43.349 --> 01:25:44.267
What was that?

01:25:47.270 --> 01:25:48.729
I just like you.

01:25:50.940 --> 01:25:52.650
I guess you like me just a little.

01:26:28.728 --> 01:26:30.104
That's not true.

01:26:51.584 --> 01:26:53.711
A usual day.

01:26:53.818 --> 01:26:57.295
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING 'ITAEWON CLASS'

01:26:57.632 --> 01:27:00.009
