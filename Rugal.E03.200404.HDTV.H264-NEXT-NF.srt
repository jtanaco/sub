<b>PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS</b>

4
00:00:50,751 --> 00:00:51,585
<b>What happened?</b>

5
00:00:52,753 --> 00:00:53,879
<b>He blew himself up.</b>

6
00:00:56,924 --> 00:00:59,802
<b>-Shall we move him to the HQ?
-No, they might be tracking him.</b>

7
00:01:01,053 --> 00:01:02,763
<b>-Let's take him to K Hospital.
-Okay.</b>

8
00:01:05,558 --> 00:01:06,726
<b>Where's Dr. Oh's number?</b>

9
00:01:20,698 --> 00:01:23,659
<b>It's a transcranial
direct-current stimulation device.</b>

10
00:01:23,743 --> 00:01:26,078
<b>-What is that?
-The method is called "brain doping."</b>

11
00:01:27,038 --> 00:01:28,998
<b>An electric current
is sent through the brain</b>

12
00:01:29,081 --> 00:01:30,833
<b>to abnormally stimulate
the bodily functions.</b>

13
00:01:30,916 --> 00:01:32,209
<b>How dangerous is it?</b>

14
00:01:32,293 --> 00:01:34,378
<b>Planting this inside someone's brain
is crazy enough.</b>

15
00:01:34,462 --> 00:01:36,672
<b>A high-voltage current
was sent through this.</b>

16
00:01:37,715 --> 00:01:40,551
<b>It's enough to blow up most people's
brains, except for rare cases.</b>

17
00:01:42,511 --> 00:01:44,680
<b>-Hello.
-Hey, Bradley.</b>

18
00:01:45,681 --> 00:01:46,891
<b>-Take a look at this.
-Okay.</b>

19
00:01:59,403 --> 00:02:02,031
<b>It can be turned on and off remotely.</b>

20
00:02:02,114 --> 00:02:05,576
<b>There's a pressure sensor, which means
he was able to control the voltage.</b>

21
00:02:06,494 --> 00:02:09,622
<b>By pressing this spot right here
like this.</b>

22
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:15,419
<b>People have disappeared,
and so have the evidence.</b>

23
00:02:15,878 --> 00:02:17,963
<b>Maybe the reason for kidnapping
is something worse</b>

24
00:02:18,047 --> 00:02:20,007
<b>than destroying everything.</b>

25
00:02:20,424 --> 00:02:23,803
<b>But don't worry too much.
It's clumsily made.</b>

26
00:02:23,886 --> 00:02:24,720
<b>It is?</b>

27
00:02:25,388 --> 00:02:27,014
<b>We're looking at a failure right here.</b>

28
00:02:27,139 --> 00:02:29,558
<b>He would've died anyway
even if his brain hadn't blown up.</b>

29
00:02:29,642 --> 00:02:31,018
<b>What do you mean?</b>

30
00:02:31,102 --> 00:02:34,355
<b>The planting procedure itself must've
damaged his central nervous system.</b>

31
00:02:34,438 --> 00:02:37,358
<b>I'm sure he experienced severe pain
and even paralysis.</b>

32
00:02:37,441 --> 00:02:39,985
<b>-So this is a failed attempt?
-The technology was ruled out</b>

33
00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:43,531
<b>during Rugal's early days
because of such adverse effects.</b>

34
00:02:45,074 --> 00:02:46,325
<b>Perhaps, this is</b>

35
00:02:47,284 --> 00:02:49,745
<b>connected to the kidnapping
of Director Gu.</b>

36
00:03:09,223 --> 00:03:11,392
<b>I should go express
my sincere condolences.</b>

37

<b>EPISODE 3</b>

38
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:23,571
<b>You made a wise decision, Director Gu.</b>

39
00:03:25,322 --> 00:03:28,325
<b>We can be pretty rough,</b>

40
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,870
<b>but we care.</b>

41
00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:34,915
<b>Once we accept someone into the family,
we stay loyal forever.</b>

42
00:03:39,503 --> 00:03:42,173
<b>I trust that you'll keep your promise.</b>

43
00:03:42,256 --> 00:03:44,842
<b>I don't have time for this.
Just tell me what you need.</b>

44
00:03:46,594 --> 00:03:48,929
<b>It used to be supported
by the government. It'll cost a lot--</b>

45
00:03:49,013 --> 00:03:51,932
<b>I have too much money,
so don't worry. What else?</b>

46
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,937
<b>I need healthy experimental bodies.
A lot of them.</b>

47
00:03:58,647 --> 00:04:00,316
<b>That will be a piece of cake for me.</b>

48
00:04:00,524 --> 00:04:02,359
<b>I'll get you men and women
from all countries.</b>

49
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:06,614
<b>I'll keep them coming
like meat hanging in a butcher shop.</b>

50
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,366
<b>Do a good job.</b>

51
00:04:13,621 --> 00:04:14,663
<b>ARGOS' MAIN BOSSES</b>

52
00:04:14,747 --> 00:04:16,123
<b>Unless they're idiots,</b>

53
00:04:16,707 --> 00:04:19,335
<b>there must be a reason why they are
interested in this technology.</b>

54
00:04:20,252 --> 00:04:23,339
<b>Argos committing crimes
with that kind of goal?</b>

55
00:04:23,714 --> 00:04:24,548
<b>That's unheard of.</b>

56
00:04:24,632 --> 00:04:26,592
<b>It's not groundless speculation.</b>

57
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:32,389
<b>The victims of a number of unsolved
kidnapping cases were former athletes.</b>

58
00:04:33,265 --> 00:04:36,560
<b>They're likely to be physically superior
to ordinary people.</b>

59
00:04:37,436 --> 00:04:40,272
<b>Kim Dae-sik was a rising marathon star
back in school.</b>

60
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:44,527
<b>Everything will be answered
once we find out who "he" is.</b>

61
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:46,111
<b>Agreed.</b>

62
00:04:46,362 --> 00:04:50,241
<b>However, we'll wrap it up here

63
00:04:50,533 --> 00:04:51,575
<b>Sir.</b>

64
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:57,623
<b>I gave you plenty of chances
to make up for your mistake.</b>

65
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:03,462
<b>-When can we expect further instructions?
-Not sure.</b>

66
00:05:03,546 --> 00:05:06,465
<b>Rugal is a national agency
with a strict command structure.</b>

67
00:05:07,132 --> 00:05:10,135
<b>We'll wait to find out who's responsible
and what the outcome is.</b>

68
00:05:13,305 --> 00:05:16,308
<b>An internal feud will break out
inside Argos.</b>

69
00:05:17,059 --> 00:05:20,646
<b>The widow, Choi Ye-won,
who took over Ko Yong-deok's position.</b>

70
00:05:20,938 --> 00:05:23,065
<b>And the mid-bosses
who are after the throne.</b>

71
00:05:24,066 --> 00:05:26,485
<b>Their internal feud will be
a golden opportunity for us.</b>

72
00:05:27,528 --> 00:05:29,738
<b>Let's just watch
how they fight amongst themselves.</b>

73
00:05:30,739 --> 00:05:31,740
<b>Is this because of me?</b>

74
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:35,911
<b>Are we reducing our action radius
due to the risk of exposure?</b>

75
00:05:36,704 --> 00:05:37,913
<b>Don't overreact.</b>

76
00:05:38,497 --> 00:05:39,873
<b>Even if that was the case,</b>

77
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:42,376
<b>we only got you out

78
00:05:46,005 --> 00:05:48,924
<b>I'll assign each of you to a mid-boss.
Find out what they're up to.</b>

79
00:05:49,466 --> 00:05:52,303
<b>Gi-beom, you'll just support the others
for the time being.</b>

80
00:05:54,555 --> 00:05:56,515
<b>I have a special task for you.</b>

81
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:03,647
<b>The security screening at Argos'
main buildings are on par with airports.</b>

82
00:06:04,106 --> 00:06:05,107
<b>Look.</b>

83
00:06:17,578 --> 00:06:19,663
<b>There are times
when you can't be a machine.</b>

84
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,916
<b>This is just a temporary solution.</b>

85
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:25,628
<b>You can be back in three hours, right?</b>

86
00:06:26,462 --> 00:06:27,546
<b>Of course.</b>

87
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:31,800
<b>Shall we make some popcorn later?
Watching people fight is so entertaining.</b>

88
00:06:31,884 --> 00:06:34,386
<b>Do you not have a brain or what?</b>

89
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:35,846
<b>Think, will you?</b>

90
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:38,098
<b>Then what about nachos and hot dogs?</b>

91
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:41,143
<b>You should go with him.</b>

92
00:06:41,226 --> 00:06:42,603
<b>Yes, I will.</b>

93
00:06:43,646 --> 00:06:45,981
<b>What? Are you avoiding me?</b>

94
00:06:46,482 --> 00:06:47,483
<b>Yes.</b>

95
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:50,110
<b>Okay.</b>

96
00:06:52,529 --> 00:06:54,073
<b>Why did I get it on my nail?</b>

97
00:06:54,156 --> 00:06:58,118
<b>It can trick metal detectors

<b>I've been wanting to ask you this.</b>

104

<b>He arrested me.</b>

123
00:09:18,509 --> 00:09:19,676
<b>That's like a movie.</b>

<b>Enemies meet again as allies.</b>

<b>Gi-joon...</b>

458
00:38:01,893 --> 00:38:03,270
<b>Are you all right?</b>

459
00:38:04,771 --> 00:38:05,730
<b>Thank you.</b>

460
00:38:07,482 --> 00:38:08,775
<b>Gi-joon...</b>

461
00:38:09,901 --> 00:38:11,152
<b>Gi-joon...</b>

462
00:38:11,736 --> 00:38:12,654
<b>My gosh.</b>

463
00:38:14,656 --> 00:38:16,157
<b>Goodness me.</b>

464
00:38:28,753 --> 00:38:29,879
<b>Let's go.</b>

465
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,692
<b><i>No one goes that far just to retaliate.</i></b>

466
00:38:51,526 --> 00:38:55,071
<b>Could there really be
another reason for this?</b>

467
00:38:55,864 --> 00:38:59,200
<b>Tae-woong, do you remember anything
from your past that could help...</b>

468
00:39:02,996 --> 00:39:05,498
<b>What I mean is...</b>

469
00:39:05,707 --> 00:39:08,126
<b>Does anything come to mind?</b>

470
00:39:09,794 --> 00:39:10,879
<b>I don't know.</b>

471
00:39:11,838 --> 00:39:12,714
<b>Not really.</b>

472
00:39:18,928 --> 00:39:22,057
<b>I don't care what the reason is
since it won't make a difference.</b>

473
00:39:22,849 --> 00:39:25,226
<b>There will be no mercy.</b>

474
00:39:26,519 --> 00:39:27,520
<b>None.</b>

475
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:41,261
<b>Shit.</b>

476
00:40:44,681 --> 00:40:46,057
<b>I won't kill you</b>

477
00:40:46,975 --> 00:40:48,393
<b>since there's no replacement.</b>

478
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:52,397
<b>It's not like we didn't try.</b>

479
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,440
<b>This is just impossible.</b>

480
00:40:53,523 --> 00:40:55,483
<b>That's the excuse you give me</b>

481
00:40:56,401 --> 00:40:58,403
<b>after killing countless people?</b>

482
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:01,531
<b>Kim Dae-sik, who was barely activated,</b>

483
00:41:02,198 --> 00:41:04,075
<b>was also a failure.</b>

484
00:41:05,076 --> 00:41:07,787
<b>He was only useful
as a self-detonating bomb.</b>

485
00:41:07,871 --> 00:41:09,247
<b>That was before I came.</b>

486
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:10,832
<b>However, the results</b>

487
00:41:11,541 --> 00:41:13,918
<b>came out after you came.</b>

488
00:41:14,002 --> 00:41:15,712
<b>No human</b>

489
00:41:16,004 --> 00:41:18,757
<b>can withstand this much reconstruction.</b>

490
00:41:21,551 --> 00:41:23,344
<b>And I'm a man who never gives up.</b>

491
00:41:24,137 --> 00:41:27,015
<b>If you don't want me
to stick these in you instead,</b>

492
00:41:27,098 --> 00:41:28,683
<b>you'll make this work.</b>

493
00:41:31,394 --> 00:41:33,855
<b>Just keep in mind that this is something</b>

494
00:41:34,939 --> 00:41:35,815
<b>I seriously want.</b>

495
00:41:37,609 --> 00:41:39,611
<b>I truly mean that.</b>

496
00:41:49,412 --> 00:41:51,372
<b>Anyway, I don't want you skipping meals.</b>

497
00:41:56,628 --> 00:41:57,587
<b>Carry on then.</b>

498
00:42:12,894 --> 00:42:14,479
<b>The police station</b>

499
00:42:15,939 --> 00:42:17,690
<b>and the hospital?</b>

500
00:42:18,858 --> 00:42:21,653
<b>Are you proud of yourselves?</b>

501
00:42:21,736 --> 00:42:23,738
<b>Are you, you fools?</b>

502
00:42:23,822 --> 00:42:27,951
<b>Find out who did this, right now!</b>

503
00:42:45,385 --> 00:42:46,761
<b>Clear the body</b>

504
00:42:47,762 --> 00:42:48,930
<b>and enjoy your meal.</b>

505
00:43:12,871 --> 00:43:14,956
<b>After obtaining what they were after,</b>

506
00:43:15,748 --> 00:43:17,792
<b>they erased traces of any evidence.</b>

507
00:43:20,211 --> 00:43:22,213
<b>They are imitating me.</b>

508
00:43:28,761 --> 00:43:30,013
<b>Hurry on in.</b>

509
00:43:34,809 --> 00:43:36,311
<b>Gwang-cheol.</b>

510
00:43:40,356 --> 00:43:41,733
<b>Tae-woong!</b>

511
00:43:44,068 --> 00:43:47,447
<b>You said you had other errands to run
when I asked you to join me.</b>

512
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:49,073
<b>Was that a lie?</b>

513
00:43:51,034 --> 00:43:52,744
<b>Before we joined Rugal,</b>

514
00:43:53,453 --> 00:43:56,706
<b>we weren't in a state to maintain</b>

515
00:43:56,789 --> 00:43:58,541
<b>any personal relationships.</b>

516
00:43:58,666 --> 00:44:00,919
<b>So, of course, we have nowhere to go</b>

517
00:44:01,002 --> 00:44:02,629
<b>and no one to see.</b>

518
00:44:04,005 --> 00:44:05,089
<b>It's obvious.</b>

519
00:44:05,173 --> 00:44:07,717
<b>There's no need to explain yourself.</b>

520
00:44:09,010 --> 00:44:09,886
<b>Right.</b>

521
00:44:23,024 --> 00:44:24,817
<b>How did you leave the organization though?</b>

522
00:44:24,901 --> 00:44:26,402
<b>It probably wasn't easy.</b>

523
00:44:29,739 --> 00:44:31,532
<b>Those in the organization</b>

524
00:44:33,409 --> 00:44:34,494
<b>killed my sister.</b>

525
00:44:38,206 --> 00:44:39,916
<b>My freedom was at the expense of her life.</b>

526
00:44:41,834 --> 00:44:43,044
<b>It's why</b>

527
00:44:44,212 --> 00:44:45,672
<b>I must be live well.</b>

528
00:44:46,047 --> 00:44:47,090
<b>Like the police.</b>

529
00:44:48,967 --> 00:44:49,968
<b>At least</b>

530
00:44:51,678 --> 00:44:52,887
<b>somewhere near their level.</b>

531
00:44:53,554 --> 00:44:54,847
<b>Why the police</b>

532
00:44:55,348 --> 00:44:56,474
<b>of all people though?</b>

533
00:44:56,557 --> 00:44:58,559
<b>Because being like those
who are my polar opposite</b>

534
00:44:59,143 --> 00:45:02,563
<b>is the only way to protect myself.</b>

535
00:45:04,065 --> 00:45:04,941
<b>What about you?</b>

536
00:45:07,151 --> 00:45:08,111
<b>Me?</b>

537
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:11,739
<b>A successful businessman
who was fucked over</b>

538
00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:14,075
<b>by a blindly righteous tattletale.</b>

539
00:45:14,659 --> 00:45:18,287
<b>That's odd since Mi-na told me
a completely different story.</b>

540
00:45:23,793 --> 00:45:25,169
<b>Mi-na, you...</b>

541
00:45:46,107 --> 00:45:50,069
<b>You see, I'm a big collector.</b>

542
00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:52,030
<b>I begged Chief Choi to give it to me.</b>

543
00:45:52,905 --> 00:45:55,408
<b>Ta-da.</b>

544
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:57,493
<b>I got it.</b>

545
00:45:57,827 --> 00:45:58,786
<b>Can you activate it?</b>

546
00:45:58,870 --> 00:46:00,121
<b>You want me to take it out?</b>

547
00:46:00,204 --> 00:46:02,123
<b>What is it? You can't?</b>

548
00:46:02,290 --> 00:46:04,709
<b>It might corrode when exposed to oxygen.</b>

549
00:46:06,085 --> 00:46:07,378
<b>You're a quack, aren't you?</b>

550
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:09,797
<b>Bring it on. This way.</b>

551
00:46:09,881 --> 00:46:10,965
<b>All right, you quack.</b>

552
00:46:11,049 --> 00:46:12,050
<b>My gosh.</b>

553
00:46:29,025 --> 00:46:32,570
<b>-We should inform Chief Choi.
-No.</b>

554
00:46:32,653 --> 00:46:35,448
<b>-What?
-Don't you know anything about covert ops?</b>

555
00:46:36,783 --> 00:46:38,117
<b>But still,</b>

556
00:46:38,201 --> 00:46:40,787
<b>this is nothing trivial.</b>

557
00:46:50,171 --> 00:46:51,672
<b>That can't be.</b>

558
00:46:52,548 --> 00:46:53,674
<b>Kang Gi-beom.</b>

559
00:46:54,592 --> 00:46:57,637
<b>I can't believe he's the one
who did this to me.</b>

560
00:46:58,471 --> 00:47:00,640
<b>I don't need to hear your opinion.</b>

561
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:03,434
<b>You should start going outside.</b>

562
00:47:04,018 --> 00:47:05,770
<b>Why is that?</b>

563
00:47:06,354 --> 00:47:08,064
<b>It's his dream to kill you.</b>

564
00:47:11,526 --> 00:47:12,527
<b>What's wrong?</b>

565
00:47:13,778 --> 00:47:17,281
<b>-Do you not want to?
-I'm not fully recovered just yet.</b>

566
00:47:18,074 --> 00:47:20,493
<b>What if I run into him?</b>

567
00:47:24,247 --> 00:47:25,581
<b>If you don't want to,</b>

568
00:47:26,332 --> 00:47:27,667
<b>then there's nothing I can do.</b>

569
00:47:28,167 --> 00:47:30,336
<b>-Just die now.
-I'll do it!</b>

570
00:47:30,419 --> 00:47:32,880
<b>I'll do anything you ask me to do!</b>

571
00:47:49,188 --> 00:47:50,064
<b>I guess</b>

572
00:47:51,899 --> 00:47:53,401
<b>you'll stay alive for a while.</b>

573
00:48:10,251 --> 00:48:13,504
<b>Send me this signal
and keep tracking it, got it?</b>

574
00:48:13,921 --> 00:48:14,922
<b>What?</b>

575
00:48:16,090 --> 00:48:17,508
<b>Wait. Where are you...</b>

576
00:48:17,592 --> 00:48:18,676
<b>Where...</b>

577
00:49:24,056 --> 00:49:26,224
<b>Hey, Kim Dae-sik's mastermind.</b>

578
00:49:30,145 --> 00:49:31,980
<b>-Min Dal-ho?
-Hey, Gi-beom.</b>

579
00:49:32,064 --> 00:49:33,315
<b>Why are you here?</b>

580
00:49:34,816 --> 00:49:36,026
<b>Weren't you looking for me?</b>

581
00:49:37,611 --> 00:49:39,738
<b>We have a lot of things to chat about.</b>

582
00:49:40,238 --> 00:49:42,783
<b>We just can't die, can we?</b>

583
00:49:48,038 --> 00:49:50,374
<b>What do you think would happen
if I were to twist your neck?</b>

584
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:52,542
<b>Spare me.</b>

585
00:49:55,337 --> 00:49:56,338
<b>No.</b>

586
00:49:57,506 --> 00:49:59,257
<b>I'll kill you one day.</b>

587
00:49:59,341 --> 00:50:00,425
<b>How frightening.</b>

588
00:50:01,134 --> 00:50:02,052
<b>Where is he?</b>

589
00:50:02,135 --> 00:50:04,221
<b>Why the hell do you ask?</b>

590
00:50:38,713 --> 00:50:39,923
<b>Damn it!</b>

591
00:50:40,215 --> 00:50:42,551
<b>What's going on? This scared me.</b>

592
00:50:42,634 --> 00:50:44,261
<b>What is that?</b>

593
00:50:45,387 --> 00:50:48,306
<b>Damn it.</b>

594
00:50:48,390 --> 00:50:50,183
<b>He never told me that would happen.</b>

595
00:50:50,267 --> 00:50:51,101
<b>Fuck.</b>

596
00:51:05,282 --> 00:51:07,325
<b>Was the voltage too high?</b>

597
00:51:11,830 --> 00:51:12,664
<b>Hello.</b>

598
00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:17,544
<b>What's wrong?</b>

599
00:51:18,211 --> 00:51:20,172
<b>It looks like you were caught
fooling around.</b>

600
00:51:20,755 --> 00:51:24,342
<b>Me? Don't be ridiculous.</b>

601
00:51:26,803 --> 00:51:27,804
<b>Wait.</b>

602
00:51:29,473 --> 00:51:31,057
<b>Hold on a minute.</b>

603
00:51:33,018 --> 00:51:34,019
<b>Wait!</b>

604
00:51:35,103 --> 00:51:37,439
<b>I see. You weren't fooling around.</b>

605
00:51:37,522 --> 00:51:39,274
<b>You were doing something dangerous.</b>

606
00:51:39,983 --> 00:51:41,109
<b>What is it?</b>

607
00:51:43,904 --> 00:51:45,113
<b>Tell him yourself.</b>

608
00:51:48,241 --> 00:51:49,117
<b>Well...</b>

609
00:51:49,201 --> 00:51:50,118
<b>So...</b>

610
00:51:52,829 --> 00:51:56,917
<b>I resuscitated Kim Dae-sik's equipment.</b>

611
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,210
<b>And then,</b>

612
00:51:58,919 --> 00:52:01,505
<b>it suddenly made this noise--</b>

613
00:52:01,588 --> 00:52:03,006
<b>Cut to the chase.</b>

614
00:52:03,465 --> 00:52:06,468
<b>Yes, sir. He has it.</b>

615
00:52:08,428 --> 00:52:09,638
<b>Chief.</b>

616
00:52:10,347 --> 00:52:11,765
<b>I can't find Gi-beom.</b>

625

662
00:55:54,195 --> 00:55:56,030
<b>I won't let your recklessness</b>

<b>I wonder why.</b>

671
00:56:35,403 --> 00:56:36,362
<b>Artificial eyes?</b>

672

<b>Or is it another body part?</b>

673

<b>That's none of your business.</b>

674

<b>First, I'll beat you to a pulp.</b>

675

<b>After that, you'll rot behind bars.</b>

676

<b>Before doing that,</b>

677

<b>Isn't that why

681
00:57:19,906 --> 00:57:21,032

682

<b>I always have a reason

683

<b>Thanks for your last words.</b>

684
