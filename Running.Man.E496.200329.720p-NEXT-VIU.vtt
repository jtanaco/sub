<b>That's not what I did.</b>

00:07:47.249 --> 00:07:49.532

<b>Ji Hyo, just focus on your dance.</b>

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:25.259
<b>What?</b>

<b>She knows the moves.</b>

00:08:47.609 --> 00:08:49.762
<b>(She got out of the cave and communicated with the world.)</b>

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.150
<b>She knows how to dance.</b>

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:54.449
<b>I'm very disappointed in Cavewoman Ji Hyo.</b>

00:08:54.449 --> 00:08:56.348
<b>- What a bummer. - She's too good.</b>

00:08:56.349 --> 00:08:57.833
<b>Ji Hyo, why are you so good?</b>

00:08:58.689 --> 00:09:00.020
<b>(Cavewoman Ji Hyo finally got out of her cave.)</b>

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:01.373
<b>I practiced the moves.</b>

<b>- I know. - Ji Hyo.</b>

00:09:06.599 --> 00:09:08.782
<b>We will have this part cut for you.</b>

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:11.130
<b>It's not funny.</b>

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:12.800
<b>- How could you... - We should change her nickname.</b>

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.000
<b>You can't communicate with the world...</b>

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.170
<b>- Okay. - like that.</b>

00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:16.839
<b>Now that I finished ZICO's dance, I'll go back to the cave.</b>

<b>Okay. You should do that.</b>

<b>I can't help but look at him.</b>

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:30.019
<b>Don't say things like that.</b>

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:32.260
<b>If you have time for that, go change your clothes.</b>

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.719
<b>- I can't stand this. - He's cute.</b>

00:09:34.719 --> 00:09:37.512
<b>Why would you do that with your mouth?</b>

<b>- How old are you, Ji Hun? - I'm 24.</b>

00:09:53.679 --> 00:09:54.709
<b>I was really surprised.</b>

00:09:54.709 --> 00:09:59.402
<b>Ji Hun, what is your number-one concern these days?</b>

00:09:59.679 --> 00:10:01.949

<b>(He gives no reply.)</b>

00:10:14.059 --> 00:10:16.400
<b>- Hey, you should say something. - End of conversation.</b>

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:17.652
<b>It makes me look bad.</b>

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:19.422
<b>- Say something to her. - The end.</b>

<b>- "We have something in common." - Just say anything.</b>

00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:05.139
<b>I will show you that Seok Jin will be torn...</b>

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:07.062
<b>into pieces in our team.</b>

00:12:07.209 --> 00:12:09.262
<b>I'll show you how he'll be torn.</b>

00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:10.949
<b>I should trust my team members.</b>

00:12:10.949 --> 00:12:11.979
<b>(What's the first mission for R coins?)</b>

00:12:11.979 --> 00:12:13.203
<b>The first mission is...</b>

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:15.133
<b>Return of Unlucky Center.</b>

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:19.743
<b>We have 30 eggs here. 20 of them are boiled, and 10 are raw.</b>

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:21.089
<b>10 raw eggs?</b>

00:12:21.089 --> 00:12:22.390
<b>Gosh, that's a lot.</b>

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:24.729
<b>Each team will break 15 eggs.</b>

00:12:24.729 --> 00:12:26.743
<b>The team with less raw eggs wins the game.</b>

00:12:27.699 --> 00:12:29.782
<b>This is Kwang Soo's trademark.</b>

00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:32.140
<b>- This is not good. - Look at that.</b>

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:34.140
<b>- You go first. - You should go first.</b>

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:35.522
<b>All right then.</b>

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:38.392
<b>- Se Chan, you go first. - Me?</b>

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:40.309
<b>- I'll try one first. - Okay.</b>

00:12:40.309 --> 00:12:41.493
<b>Se Chan.</b>

00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:44.109
<b>- Se Chan. - It's good. I have a good feeling.</b>

00:12:44.109 --> 00:12:45.920
<b>- 1, 2, and... - I think it's raw.</b>

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:47.233
<b>1, 2, and 3.</b>

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:50.049
<b>- Okay. - Nice.</b>

00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:51.219
<b>He did it.</b>

00:12:51.219 --> 00:12:52.772
<b>You just succeeded, so you can try one more time.</b>

00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:54.089
<b>I think it will break.</b>

00:12:54.089 --> 00:12:55.859
<b>- There are 10 raw eggs. - Can I change it?</b>

00:12:55.859 --> 00:12:57.929
<b>- No, you can't. - He says I can.</b>

00:12:57.929 --> 00:12:59.900
<b>- You can't switch. - You can't.</b>

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:01.660
<b>- No. It's over once you touch it. - Once you grab it,</b>

00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:02.969
<b>you can feel it.</b>

00:13:02.969 --> 00:13:04.300
<b>Can you feel it? Go ahead and try.</b>

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:05.740
<b>- Why? - You said you can feel it.</b>

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:08.370
<b>Why are you twisting my arm?</b>

00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:10.392
<b>(You can talk to me. Why are you twist my arm?)</b>

00:13:11.439 --> 00:13:13.140
<b>When did I twist your arm?</b>

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:16.609
<b>At a slight tickle, I feel pain here.</b>

00:13:16.609 --> 00:13:18.363
<b>- I didn't twist your arm. - It must've hurt a lot.</b>

00:13:18.579 --> 00:13:20.819
<b>You should sound strong.</b>

00:13:20.819 --> 00:13:22.620
<b>- "Why are you twisting my arm?" - Right.</b>

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:24.520
<b>- Why did you sound so gentle? - He sounded like a little kid.</b>

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:26.160
<b>- Did I do that? - I'm innocent.</b>

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:27.703
<b>You should yell at him.</b>

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.260
<b>(ZICO, Do Hyun, Ji Hun, and Seong Wu has broken 12 eggs.)</b>

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.412
<b>Good. You did a good job.</b>

00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:35.030
<b>- Now it's Kwang Soo's turn. - Watch carefully, guys.</b>

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:36.400
<b>(Kwang Soo needs to break 3 eggs.)</b>

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:37.829
<b>You'll see why he's Lee Kwang Soo.</b>

00:13:37.829 --> 00:13:39.770
<b>(Watch carefully. You'll see why he's Lee Kwang Soo.)</b>

00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:41.323
<b>- Good. - This is a good chance.</b>

00:13:41.339 --> 00:13:42.593
<b>That's dangerous.</b>

00:13:42.609 --> 00:13:43.892
<b>- Yes! - Gosh.</b>

00:13:44.939 --> 00:13:46.623
<b>- What's with him? - Kwang Soo.</b>

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:47.709
<b>This is amazing.</b>

00:13:47.709 --> 00:13:49.479
<b>Kwang Soo, that doesn't seem like you.</b>

00:13:49.479 --> 00:13:51.192
<b>- Did you just drool? - I did.</b>

00:13:51.609 --> 00:13:54.020
<b>- Are you that happy? - I'm so thrilled.</b>

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:55.949
<b>Is this what you're doing today?</b>

00:13:55.949 --> 00:13:58.032
<b>I'm sorry. I was carried away. Just hurry.</b>

00:13:58.089 --> 00:13:59.373
<b>- He's drooling. - No.</b>

00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:01.189
<b>- This is... - That's dangerous.</b>

00:14:01.189 --> 00:14:02.990
<b>(Did he pick a boiled egg again?)</b>

00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:04.689
<b>- I have a bad feeling. - This is...</b>

00:14:04.689 --> 00:14:06.329
<b>(Stepping back)</b>

00:14:06.329 --> 00:14:07.900
<b>(Breaking)</b>

00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:09.829
<b>(It's not surprising that he broke a raw egg.)</b>

00:14:09.829 --> 00:14:11.853
<b>I knew it.</b>

00:14:12.099 --> 00:14:13.599
<b>(He tries one more time.)</b>

00:14:13.599 --> 00:14:15.522
<b>- That's right. - It's okay.</b>

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:17.410
<b>- The probability isn't so bad. - It's okay.</b>

00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:19.062
<b>- The odds are good. - You have one left.</b>

00:14:19.079 --> 00:14:21.079
<b>- You're doing a good job. - Is your forehead okay?</b>

00:14:21.079 --> 00:14:23.010
<b>- Kwang Soo likes this game. - How many eggs?</b>

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:24.709
<b>They broke eight raw eggs.</b>

00:14:24.709 --> 00:14:27.349
<b>- You broke a lot of raw eggs. - We did a good job.</b>

00:14:27.349 --> 00:14:28.849
<b>- It's 8 out of 10. - 8 out of 10?</b>

00:14:28.849 --> 00:14:30.319
<b>We broke 8 out of 10, right?</b>

00:14:30.319 --> 00:14:32.050
<b>- Are there 10 raw eggs? - Right.</b>

00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:33.419
<b>Shall we begin?</b>

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:34.819
<b>I'll break two eggs without a break.</b>

00:14:34.819 --> 00:14:36.412
<b>- What's that hat? - One...</b>

00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:37.929
<b>- "What's that hat?" - It's funny, isn't it?</b>

00:14:37.929 --> 00:14:39.613
<b>Is it Leon's hat?</b>

00:14:40.359 --> 00:14:41.583
<b>It's 1 and 1.</b>

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:42.983
<b>It hurts.</b>

00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:44.883
<b>Didn't it hurt?</b>

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:47.152
<b>I love this moment even though it hurts.</b>

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:49.652
<b>- Enjoy it. - I'm having a lot of fun.</b>

00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:54.493
<b>So Min looks like she's on a spring picnic.</b>

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:56.279
<b>So Min looks pretty today.</b>

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:58.308
<b>It looks like a spring day.</b>

00:14:58.309 --> 00:14:59.902
<b>She looks like a freshman in college.</b>

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:01.849
<b>Look at her smile.</b>

00:15:01.849 --> 00:15:05.843
<b>Seriously, no one's looking at her as you say that.</b>

00:15:06.059 --> 00:15:07.490
<b>They all are staring into empty space.</b>

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:08.719
<b>They only care about eggs.</b>

00:15:08.719 --> 00:15:09.760
<b>They are looking at the apartments.</b>

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:11.829
<b>- Why are they so distracted? - It's unbelievable.</b>

00:15:11.829 --> 00:15:13.383
<b>I know I'm quite old.</b>

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:14.859
<b>I admit it.</b>

00:15:14.859 --> 00:15:16.912
<b>So Min, just break an egg.</b>

00:15:19.199 --> 00:15:20.300
<b>(So Min is back to her job.)</b>

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:21.670
<b>She's good. This is what you should do.</b>

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:24.140
<b>(She broke 2 raw eggs in a row.)</b>

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:26.363
<b>(The good-looking members respond to the raw eggs.)</b>

00:15:27.179 --> 00:15:28.640
<b>(Ji Hyo, Jong Kook, and Jae Seok broke eggs in turn.)</b>

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:29.833
<b>It broke.</b>

00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:33.280
<b>- We don't know it yet. - It's a tie.</b>

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:34.880
<b>- How many eggs are left? 2? - Seok Jin, there are 2.</b>

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:36.402
<b>- There are only two. - I should do this right.</b>

00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:38.772
<b>- Seok Jin, please. - It has to be raw.</b>

00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:41.719
<b>(Raw)</b>

00:15:41.719 --> 00:15:44.473
<b>(What's Team Jee Seok Jin's fate?)</b>

00:15:46.359 --> 00:15:48.530
<b>(A raw egg)</b>

00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:50.782
<b>(We win!)</b>

00:15:50.829 --> 00:15:53.022
<b>- Well done. - It's raw.</b>

00:15:53.339 --> 00:15:54.953
<b>So what's good for them?</b>

00:15:56.069 --> 00:15:58.170
<b>- Why are you moving on so fast? - What's the rush?</b>

00:15:58.170 --> 00:15:59.240
<b>I don't know what else to do.</b>

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:02.463
<b>Since Team Lee Kwang Soo won, they should hand in 15 coins.</b>

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:04.650
<b>Team Jee Seok Jin lost, so they should hand in 20 coins.</b>

00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:06.203
<b>It's just five more coins.</b>

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:10.473
<b>Now each member will go into the Cashier's office...</b>

00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:12.990
<b>and hand in R coins in the order that the center determines.</b>

00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:15.390
<b>As I informed you earlier, the center goes in there last...</b>

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:17.260
<b>and return the R coins to make up the shortage.</b>

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.000
<b>And the center...</b>

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.912
<b>can check the remaining R coins of the members.</b>

00:16:20.929 --> 00:16:24.753
<b>And he can point out the member who returned least R coins.</b>

00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:27.370
<b>If the center points out the member who handed in the fewest coins,</b>

00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:30.652
<b>the member will make up the difference instead of the center.</b>

00:16:30.709 --> 00:16:32.839
<b>I didn't know about that.</b>

00:16:32.839 --> 00:16:34.339
<b>If he fails to single out the betrayer,</b>

00:16:34.339 --> 00:16:37.493
<b>the center will hand in another five coins for not believing his member.</b>

00:16:38.449 --> 00:16:39.833
<b>- If I get it wrong... - Yes.</b>

00:16:39.849 --> 00:16:41.420
<b>When you go into the Cashier's office,</b>

00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:44.103
<b>you'll be told the cumulative number of coins.</b>

00:16:45.219 --> 00:16:47.490
<b>- The winning team goes first. - Okay.</b>

00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:49.243
<b>Let's make this look beautiful.</b>

00:16:49.329 --> 00:16:50.429
<b>We should do this equally.</b>

00:16:50.429 --> 00:16:52.358
<b>Three coins per person.</b>

00:16:52.359 --> 00:16:54.000
<b>Then you won't have to return your coins.</b>

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.129
<b>We should protect Kwang Soo.</b>

00:16:56.130 --> 00:16:57.599
<b>- We should. - Right.</b>

00:16:57.599 --> 00:17:00.270
<b>- So we will hand in our coins. - Okay.</b>

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:01.870
<b>- Let's do this right. - Do we need to give 20 coins?</b>

00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:04.209
<b>- We should hand in 20 coins. - How many coins per person?</b>

00:17:04.209 --> 00:17:05.709
<b>- Let's be conscientious... - Hand in three coins.</b>

00:17:05.709 --> 00:17:06.939
<b>Three coins per person.</b>

00:17:06.939 --> 00:17:09.450
<b>- And I'll hand in five coins. - That would look great.</b>

00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:11.050
<b>- Let's do that. - All right.</b>

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:12.649
<b>- I'll hand in 3 coins. - 3 coins.</b>

00:17:12.649 --> 00:17:14.863
<b>This is just the beginning.</b>

00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:16.619
<b>- Seok Jin. - This is the first game.</b>

00:17:16.619 --> 00:17:17.649
<b>This is the first game.</b>

00:17:17.649 --> 00:17:19.419
<b>I can tell that you're thinking of petty tricks.</b>

00:17:19.419 --> 00:17:22.343
<b>- Me? That's not true. - He should single out a member.</b>

00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:25.359
<b>Even if I don't hand in my coins, I'll be safe if he guesses wrong.</b>

00:17:25.359 --> 00:17:28.142
<b>That's why I have to hand in three coins.</b>

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:31.652
<b>- You go first then. - Kwang Soo, determine the order.</b>

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.270
<b>I'll call the most reliable one first.</b>

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:35.553
<b>Do Hyun goes first.</b>

00:17:35.569 --> 00:17:36.669
<b>- Me? - Okay.</b>

00:17:36.669 --> 00:17:38.492
<b>- Do Hyun goes first. - Yes. I'll be right back.</b>

00:17:38.569 --> 00:17:40.139
<b>- Just three coins. - Remember what we said.</b>

00:17:40.139 --> 00:17:43.510
<b>- I don't want anything else. - I think they are naive and nice.</b>

00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:44.809
<b>They seem very nice.</b>

00:17:44.809 --> 00:17:46.180
<b>Can I give you my coins here?</b>

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:48.763
<b>(Do Hyun seems quite reliable. How many coins is he handing in?)</b>

00:17:49.349 --> 00:17:52.002
<b>(He promised to give 3 coins.)</b>

00:17:53.889 --> 00:17:57.573
<b>(Do Hyun handed in 3 coins as he promised.)</b>

00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:02.182
<b>He handed some to them.</b>

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:05.212
<b>- Next up is Ji Hun. - Okay.</b>

00:18:05.329 --> 00:18:07.652
<b>You shouldn't give them any.</b>

00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:10.553
<b>How many did the person in front of me give?</b>

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:15.462
<b>(Do Hyun gave 3 coins.)</b>

00:18:16.409 --> 00:18:19.133
<b>(Will he keep his end of the bargain as well?)</b>

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:24.103
<b>(He gives 3 as well.)</b>

00:18:26.119 --> 00:18:27.873
<b>Kwang Soo will probably suspect me, right?</b>

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:30.129
<b>- Here. - Take them.</b>

00:18:30.129 --> 00:18:32.329
<b>- ZICO, why are looking at me? - Gosh.</b>

00:18:32.329 --> 00:18:35.383
<b>I can't believe you. Isn't it a bit too early?</b>

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:37.970
<b>- Why are you looking at me? - Isn't it a bit early?</b>

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:40.023
<b>Kwang Soo, go.</b>

00:18:40.069 --> 00:18:41.399
<b>Can I pick Se Chan before paying up?</b>

00:18:41.399 --> 00:18:42.740
<b>- Don't do that. - No?</b>

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:43.839
<b>- Just go first. - Do I need to go first?</b>

00:18:43.839 --> 00:18:44.839
<b>You've already betrayed us.</b>

00:18:44.839 --> 00:18:46.123
<b>(He's going to check how many coins there are.)</b>

00:18:46.339 --> 00:18:48.109
<b>(Did any of them betray the team?)</b>

00:18:48.109 --> 00:18:49.192
<b>Hello.</b>

00:18:52.649 --> 00:18:54.619
<b>(There should be a total of 15 coins.)</b>

00:18:54.619 --> 00:18:55.889
<b>(There are 12 coins in total. 3 are missing.)</b>

00:18:55.889 --> 00:18:57.002
<b>"12"?</b>

00:18:58.550 --> 00:18:59.742
<b>"12"?</b>

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:01.873
<b>Do I pick the suspect here?</b>

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:03.129
<b>Or do I do it over there?</b>

00:19:03.129 --> 00:19:05.313
<b>(He can either pay for everything or catch the traitor.)</b>

00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:09.300
<b>- Can I pick without paying up? - Yes.</b>

00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:10.383
<b>I'll do that.</b>

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:11.800
<b>Okay.</b>

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:12.800
<b>(He's going to pick the traitor.)</b>

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:14.139
<b>- Kwang Soo. - Yes?</b>

00:19:14.139 --> 00:19:15.793
<b>How many did you give them?</b>

00:19:15.869 --> 00:19:17.752
<b>Look at his face.</b>

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:20.139
<b>You look worked up.</b>

00:19:20.139 --> 00:19:21.680
<b>- I'm fine. - He must've paid a lot.</b>

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:22.849
<b>You look upset.</b>

00:19:22.849 --> 00:19:26.680
<b>There's a filthy loach among us.</b>

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:28.050
<b>(They burst into laughter.)</b>

00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:30.689
<b>- There's one. - I bet there are more.</b>

00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:33.190
<b>I'm going to catch him.</b>

00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:34.290
<b>- One? - Really?</b>

00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:35.873
<b>There is one loach...</b>

00:19:36.089 --> 00:19:38.389
<b>- Is there a loach among you? - that is ruining our team.</b>

00:19:38.389 --> 00:19:39.659
<b>I can see my future in him.</b>

00:19:39.659 --> 00:19:41.129
<b>- Please pick. - I trust you guys.</b>

00:19:41.129 --> 00:19:42.283
<b>I pick...</b>

00:19:42.829 --> 00:19:46.982
<b>(Which one of them does he think paid the least amount?)</b>

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:50.109
<b>Se Chan.</b>

00:19:50.109 --> 00:19:52.452
<b>(He picks Se Chan.)</b>

00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:54.040
<b>I think Se Chan paid up.</b>

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:55.339
<b>- Goodness. - He did.</b>

00:19:55.339 --> 00:19:57.432
<b>There's no one else to pick.</b>

00:19:57.510 --> 00:20:00.050
<b>Seong Wu looks brazen.</b>

00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:01.680
<b>- Guys like him betray easily. - You paid?</b>

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:03.803
<b>- Let's see the result. - I'll tell you.</b>

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:07.202
<b>Kwang Soo, you have...</b>

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:09.990
<b>- failed. - Hey.</b>

00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:12.343
<b>- See? - Please pay five more coins.</b>

00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:15.442
<b>You'll become broke if you trust the wrong people.</b>

00:20:17.669 --> 00:20:18.769
<b>What?</b>

00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:19.800
<b>The total is...</b>

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:22.593
<b>(Se Chan checked the total amount.)</b>

00:20:23.069 --> 00:20:24.240
<b>(I should pay 3 coins.)</b>

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:25.793
<b>(He'll pick me, then.)</b>

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:29.780
<b>(He wanted Kwang Soo to suspect him and paid 3 coins.)</b>

00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:33.479
<b>The loach is among them!</b>

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:35.780
<b>- It's 1 of these 3. - I saw all of them paying.</b>

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:38.119
<b>ZICO seemed as if he was wrongfully accused.</b>

00:20:38.119 --> 00:20:40.589
<b>(Which one of them is the loach?)</b>

00:20:40.589 --> 00:20:42.972
<b>Kwang Soo, please pay five more coins.</b>

00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:44.472
<b>I should've just paid three back then.</b>

00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:48.883
<b>(He pays 5 more for wrongfully suspecting Se Chan.)</b>

00:20:49.329 --> 00:20:51.853
<b>We'll start with our loach.</b>

00:20:52.839 --> 00:20:54.740
<b>- I'm speechless and upset. - She'll go first.</b>

00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:57.540
<b>- She won't be able to betray us. - I'm a scapegoat.</b>

00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:59.710
<b>The loach will go first.</b>

00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:00.793
<b>(Lady Loach goes first.)</b>

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:05.409
<b>(Amidst everyone's suspicion, what will she do?)</b>

00:21:05.409 --> 00:21:07.149
<b>You're already back?</b>

00:21:07.149 --> 00:21:09.419
<b>- Yes, because I paid. - Did you not pay?</b>

00:21:09.419 --> 00:21:11.550
<b>- Really? Let me check. - I think this is...</b>

00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:13.760
<b>- a good deal. - I bet she paid up this time.</b>

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:15.059
<b>- You're right. - Because...</b>

00:21:15.059 --> 00:21:17.559
<b>- She got caught in the first round. - Of course, I paid up.</b>

00:21:17.559 --> 00:21:19.043
<b>There's no way I wouldn't have.</b>

00:21:19.159 --> 00:21:21.159
<b>Seok Jin, you need to watch Jae Seok.</b>

00:21:21.159 --> 00:21:24.283
<b>I bet Jae Seok will accuse me no matter what.</b>

00:21:24.829 --> 00:21:27.123
<b>See? He's acting.</b>

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:28.500
<b>(Exclaiming)</b>

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:30.908
<b>Look at how awkward he looks.</b>

00:21:30.909 --> 00:21:32.422
<b>Already?</b>

00:21:33.139 --> 00:21:34.363
<b>Then...</b>

00:21:35.639 --> 00:21:36.763
<b>Here.</b>

00:21:38.309 --> 00:21:40.780
<b>(Next up is Haha.)</b>

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:42.119
<b>(There's a total of 3 coins.)</b>

00:21:42.119 --> 00:21:43.819
<b>(There are only 3 coins.)</b>

00:21:43.819 --> 00:21:46.373
<b>Someone didn't pay, right?</b>

00:21:46.589 --> 00:21:48.020
<b>- Then... - I'll...</b>

00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:49.829
<b>(Haha, Jong Kook, and Ji Hyo have paid.)</b>

00:21:49.829 --> 00:21:51.430
<b>I trust you guys.</b>

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:53.230
<b>I hope I'll be able to smile when I get there.</b>

00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:56.313
<b>I had no idea So Min would do that from the get-go.</b>

00:21:57.669 --> 00:21:59.839
<b>- Goodness. - He's driving me crazy.</b>

00:21:59.839 --> 00:22:00.922
<b>Gosh.</b>

00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:03.839
<b>My goodness.</b>

00:22:03.839 --> 00:22:05.940
<b>They've all gone insane.</b>

00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:07.492
<b>How could they do this?</b>

00:22:07.609 --> 00:22:10.232
<b>Is it that hard to pay three coins?</b>

00:22:11.849 --> 00:22:14.220
<b>I did expect some of them to betray the team but...</b>

00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:15.763
<b>(He needs to pay all 14 coins or pick out the traitor.)</b>

00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:18.972
<b>Gosh.</b>

00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:20.720
<b>You guys are something.</b>

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:22.389
<b>- Seok Jin, trust me. - Did you see?</b>

00:22:22.389 --> 00:22:24.629
<b>There is a loach among us.</b>

00:22:24.629 --> 00:22:26.230
<b>- Seok Jin. - Catch the loach.</b>

00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:27.328
<b>- Seok Jin. - Yes.</b>

00:22:27.329 --> 00:22:28.912
<b>Jae Seok looks thirsty.</b>

00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:31.169
<b>Will you pay up or pick the suspect?</b>

00:22:31.169 --> 00:22:33.440
<b>The latter, of course. I'd be a fool not to.</b>

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:34.770
<b>If you pick me,</b>

00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:36.369
<b>- that would be your mistake. - Pick one.</b>

00:22:36.369 --> 00:22:37.909
<b>You need to trust me.</b>

00:22:37.909 --> 00:22:39.639
<b>- Jae Seok looks anxious. - Your mouth's full.</b>

00:22:39.639 --> 00:22:41.210
<b>Look at me.</b>

00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:43.763
<b>- How many did you pay? - I didn't know she'd betray us.</b>

00:22:43.879 --> 00:22:47.149
<b>I'll be honest. I paid two coins.</b>

00:22:47.149 --> 00:22:48.220
<b>That little...</b>

00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:49.319
<b>(I know the truth.)</b>

00:22:49.319 --> 00:22:50.819
<b>- I'm serious. - I ought to just...</b>

00:22:50.819 --> 00:22:52.790
<b>- You paid two coins? - Yes.</b>

00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:54.073
<b>I paid two coins.</b>

00:22:54.119 --> 00:22:56.859
<b>If the people who went first paid the correct amount,</b>

00:22:56.859 --> 00:22:58.889
<b>- I'd be relieved. - Hey.</b>

00:22:58.889 --> 00:23:01.859
<b>Will you only believe me once I crack one of these open?</b>

00:23:01.859 --> 00:23:04.270
<b>- What are you doing? - I'm innocent!</b>

00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:05.930
<b>- Goodness. - You picked the right ones.</b>

00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:07.869
<b>- You did. - You picked well.</b>

00:23:07.869 --> 00:23:09.169
<b>He's extremely unlucky.</b>

00:23:09.169 --> 00:23:11.240
<b>- That's strange. - Why were all of them...</b>

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:12.909
<b>- boiled eggs? - None of them were raw.</b>

00:23:12.909 --> 00:23:14.540
<b>- One of them should've burst. - I bet you paid one.</b>

00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:15.780
<b>- One? - Jae Seok too.</b>

00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:17.550
<b>I paid two!</b>

00:23:17.550 --> 00:23:19.363
<b>- I paid two! - You're good.</b>

00:23:19.379 --> 00:23:21.419
<b>- You're good. - You are.</b>

00:23:21.419 --> 00:23:23.050
<b>There aren't even that many eggs left.</b>

00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:24.373
<b>Goodness.</b>

00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:25.720
<b>Why are all of them boiled?</b>

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:27.260
<b>You should've been this lucky during the previous game.</b>

00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:29.202
<b>I can't express my innocence!</b>

00:23:29.659 --> 00:23:31.389
<b>- Goodness. - Please pick the suspect.</b>

00:23:31.389 --> 00:23:32.588
<b>Okay.</b>

00:23:32.589 --> 00:23:33.760
<b>I think he'll get it right.</b>

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:36.299
<b>(Will he be able to pick out the traitor?)</b>

00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:38.369
<b>- Jae Seok! - Goodness.</b>

00:23:38.369 --> 00:23:39.440
<b>Jae Seok.</b>

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:40.740
<b>- I think So Min... - You're probably right.</b>

00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:41.940
<b>- paid 1 coin. - I paid 2 coins.</b>

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:43.139
<b>I bet she paid one.</b>

00:23:43.139 --> 00:23:44.940
<b>- You paid two? - I'm sure she paid.</b>

00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:46.579
<b>- You caught him. - I did.</b>

00:23:46.579 --> 00:23:48.863
<b>- Seok Jin, - I got it right.</b>

00:23:48.909 --> 00:23:50.432
<b>you have...</b>

00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:52.979
<b>- failed. - What?</b>

00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:54.280
<b>I told you.</b>

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:56.118
<b>- You paid? - She...</b>

00:23:56.119 --> 00:23:57.950
<b>Why didn't you believe me?</b>

00:23:57.950 --> 00:23:59.232
<b>(Is the traitor someone else?)</b>

00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:03.260
<b>(Jae Seok paid 2 coins.)</b>

00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:04.472
<b>I should do this.</b>

00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:06.460
<b>You know, right?</b>

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:08.442
<b>- She's the real culprit. - My gosh.</b>

00:24:08.659 --> 00:24:10.613
<b>- Who didn't pay up? - It's So Min.</b>

00:24:11.369 --> 00:24:16.770
<b>I know it looks like I'll pay three, but I won't.</b>

00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:18.210
<b>(Ji Hyo didn't pay anything.)</b>

00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:19.293
<b>Okay.</b>

00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:22.909
<b>The first mission is over.</b>

00:24:22.909 --> 00:24:24.950
<b>Change into your uniforms and move to the next location.</b>

00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:27.502
<b>(Both centers failed to catch the traitors and paid more.)</b>

00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:30.690
<b>(There's a mysterious ranking list.)</b>

00:24:30.690 --> 00:24:33.202
<b>What are these photos?</b>

00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:35.190
<b>You guys look so unctuous.</b>

00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:37.212
<b>That's the face Kwang Soo makes when taking photos.</b>

00:24:37.290 --> 00:24:39.290
<b>- He raises his head. - It's my favorite photo.</b>

00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:40.530
<b>He loves that angle.</b>

00:24:40.530 --> 00:24:41.629
<b>He poses like that at airports abroad.</b>

00:24:41.629 --> 00:24:44.313
<b>- He likes that angle. - It's that.</b>

00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:47.583
<b>Excuse me, but are Se Chan and Kwang Soo in disguises?</b>

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.000
<b>(They look too ugly.)</b>

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.108
<b>Not at all.</b>

00:24:50.109 --> 00:24:52.422
<b>Our team is known for being good-looking.</b>

00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:55.839
<b>This mission is called Get into Any Rankings.</b>

00:24:55.839 --> 00:24:57.533
<b>(Get into Any Rankings)</b>

00:24:57.609 --> 00:24:59.763
<b>Get into any rankings</b>

00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:01.480
<b><i>What's the problem?</i></b>

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:02.919
<b>A professional company...</b>

00:25:02.919 --> 00:25:07.142
<b>has surveyed 112 individuals in their 20s and 60s.</b>

00:25:07.159 --> 00:25:08.873
<b>I'll give you a different genre for each round.</b>

00:25:08.919 --> 00:25:12.430
<b>Predict your rankings after discussing among yourselves.</b>

00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:15.099
<b>Place your pieces among the 12 rankings.</b>

00:25:15.099 --> 00:25:16.912
<b>You'll get points if you're right.</b>

00:25:17.669 --> 00:25:20.800
<b>- I need to rank myself? - Correct.</b>

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:22.099
<b>More than one piece...</b>

00:25:22.099 --> 00:25:24.293
<b>- can be on each ranking. - Really?</b>

00:25:24.409 --> 00:25:26.740
<b>The team that gets the most correct rankings wins.</b>

00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:29.579
<b>You'll need to get 2 out of the 3 rounds correct.</b>

00:25:29.579 --> 00:25:31.392
<b>This is tricky.</b>

00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:33.232
<b>We don't know how others think of us.</b>

00:25:33.419 --> 00:25:35.363
<b>- Here's the first question. - Okay.</b>

00:25:35.819 --> 00:25:39.103
<b>We asked 112 people in their 20s to 60s.</b>

00:25:39.119 --> 00:25:40.389
<b>"Who do you think was the most popular..."</b>

00:25:40.389 --> 00:25:41.720
<b>"to the opposite gender when they were young?"</b>

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:43.430
<b>(Who do you think was the most popular...)</b>

00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:44.942
<b>(to the opposite gender when they were young?)</b>

00:25:45.389 --> 00:25:47.482
<b>- This is... - This is easy.</b>

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:48.899
<b>This is...</b>

00:25:48.899 --> 00:25:51.930
<b>- definitely me. - Popular to the opposite gender?</b>

00:25:51.930 --> 00:25:54.500
<b>The most likely ones are over there.</b>

00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:57.252
<b>- Right. - There's ZICO,</b>

00:25:57.569 --> 00:25:59.109
<b>Seong Wu, and more.</b>

00:25:59.109 --> 00:26:01.063
<b>The four lowest rankings are neck and neck.</b>

00:26:01.409 --> 00:26:03.010
<b>We're definitely neck and neck.</b>

00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:04.510
<b>- That's heartbreaking. - Four?</b>

00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:06.250
<b>Yes, four. We'll be neck and neck.</b>

00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:08.303
<b>You're right.</b>

00:26:08.919 --> 00:26:10.020
<b>When we were young?</b>

00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:12.418
<b>The age range is...</b>

00:26:12.419 --> 00:26:14.290
<b>- Too broad? - Yes.</b>

00:26:14.290 --> 00:26:16.730
<b>- I think you and Se Chan... - I agree.</b>

00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:19.460
<b>- will be placed higher. - But...</b>

00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:21.559
<b>Seong Wu said something very kind.</b>

00:26:21.559 --> 00:26:24.083
<b>He said the age range was too broad,</b>

00:26:24.129 --> 00:26:27.182
<b>so the others had good chances as well.</b>

00:26:27.339 --> 00:26:29.399
<b>- Not at all. - He's so kindhearted.</b>

00:26:29.399 --> 00:26:31.210
<b>- That's not what I meant. - He said it so nicely.</b>

00:26:31.210 --> 00:26:33.379
<b>- Thanks. - That's not what I meant.</b>

00:26:33.379 --> 00:26:36.932
<b>Since the elderly know them two better...</b>

00:26:37.109 --> 00:26:38.392
<b>That wasn't the nuance he gave off earlier.</b>

00:26:38.609 --> 00:26:40.180
<b>It sounded like he was saying, "Cheer up."</b>

00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:42.303
<b>(He was pitying them.)</b>

00:26:42.349 --> 00:26:43.849
<b>- "You can do it." - "You can do it."</b>

00:26:43.849 --> 00:26:45.672
<b>- That's what I felt. - Not at all.</b>

00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:48.319
<b>I wasn't going to say this.</b>

00:26:48.319 --> 00:26:49.730
<b>(He suddenly interrupts them.)</b>

00:26:49.730 --> 00:26:51.212
<b>Then don't say it.</b>

00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:53.430
<b>Cut.</b>

00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:56.299
<b>It's best not to say anything if you're hesitant.</b>

00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:58.083
<b>Let me brag about my bachelor days.</b>

00:26:58.629 --> 00:27:00.623
<b>I hope this will help.</b>

00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:03.940
<b>Someone asked for my number on the streets.</b>

00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:05.869
<b>Did you give them your pager number or what?</b>

00:27:05.869 --> 00:27:07.139
<b>- What? - What did you give them back then?</b>

00:27:07.139 --> 00:27:08.309
<b>We didn't even have pagers.</b>

00:27:08.309 --> 00:27:09.680
<b>Did you give them your homing pigeon's name?</b>

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:12.232
<b>(Did they exchange letters through homing pigeons?)</b>

00:27:13.119 --> 00:27:15.819
<b>- 9999-9999? - "9999"?</b>

00:27:15.819 --> 00:27:18.002
<b>They asked me...</b>

00:27:18.119 --> 00:27:19.818
<b>- for my number. - Cut.</b>

00:27:19.819 --> 00:27:21.990
<b>What about you, Do Hyun? Were you popular?</b>

00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:23.530
<b>- I bet he was. - Do tell us.</b>

00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:26.190
<b>We need to rank ourselves.</b>

00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:27.930
<b>Back then, you had to be humble...</b>

00:27:27.930 --> 00:27:29.669
<b>- and not brag about such things. - Right.</b>

00:27:29.669 --> 00:27:31.300
<b>- But times have changed. - Right.</b>

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:33.300
<b>- To be honest, - Yes, be honest.</b>

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:36.639
<b>it was Valentine's Day in elementary school.</b>

00:27:36.639 --> 00:27:38.770
<b>There were chocolates on my desk.</b>

00:27:38.770 --> 00:27:40.780
<b>- How much did you have? - On your desk?</b>

00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:42.780
<b>- Can I brag? - Of course.</b>

00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:46.033
<b>- You can. - He's almost 60, and he bragged.</b>

00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:48.879
<b>My mom came to school...</b>

00:27:48.879 --> 00:27:50.690
<b>- and helped me carry them home. - My goodness.</b>

00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:53.020
<b>This was in second grade.</b>

00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:54.790
<b>Did you participate in relay races during field day?</b>

00:27:54.790 --> 00:27:56.089
<b>- Every time. - Goodness.</b>

00:27:56.089 --> 00:27:57.430
<b>Then there's nothing more to say.</b>

00:27:57.430 --> 00:27:58.990
<b>- I was the last runner. - The fourth runner!</b>

00:27:58.990 --> 00:28:00.099
<b>- He was the fourth runner. - The fourth runner?</b>

00:28:00.099 --> 00:28:02.159
<b>The fourth runner is always the popular one.</b>

00:28:02.159 --> 00:28:04.452
<b>- Seok Jin... - I was quite athletic.</b>

00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:06.740
<b>- Didn't you play basketball? - In school.</b>

00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:09.353
<b>Yes, I played basketball in high school.</b>

00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:11.869
<b>- Then girls would've liked him. - He had to be popular.</b>

00:28:11.869 --> 00:28:14.480
<b>- Sports drinks... - Beverages?</b>

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:15.639
<b>Girls gave him sports drinks.</b>

00:28:15.639 --> 00:28:18.079
<b>- Yes, sports drinks. - He reminds me...</b>

00:28:18.079 --> 00:28:19.649
<b>- of the protagonists in TV dramas. - Right?</b>

00:28:19.649 --> 00:28:21.980
<b>We see people like him in TV commercials too.</b>

00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:22.990
<b>Yes, by the fountain.</b>

00:28:22.990 --> 00:28:24.649
<b>Ji Hun, what about you?</b>

00:28:24.649 --> 00:28:25.720
<b>Me?</b>

00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:28.558
<b>In middle school, after classes began,</b>

00:28:28.559 --> 00:28:30.430
<b>for about three days...</b>

00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:31.912
<b>(For 3 days after starting middle school...)</b>

00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:33.858
<b>- Yes? - What happened?</b>

00:28:33.859 --> 00:28:36.530
<b>Girls were lined up.</b>

00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:37.530
<b>- And... - Just to see you?</b>

00:28:37.530 --> 00:28:38.730
<b>To get a glimpse of you?</b>

00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:41.252
<b>So that they could cleanse their eyes!</b>

00:28:41.270 --> 00:28:42.569
<b>Girls come by to look at handsome boys.</b>

00:28:42.569 --> 00:28:44.440
<b>I can't believe things like that happens.</b>

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:45.770
<b>- Exactly. - Girls line up?</b>

00:28:45.770 --> 00:28:49.079
<b>We only thought that happened in movies or TV dramas.</b>

00:28:49.079 --> 00:28:51.109
<b>Many went by to get a glimpse of Se Chan too,</b>

00:28:51.109 --> 00:28:52.280
<b>but for a different reason.</b>

00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:54.349
<b>- Like coming to the zoo? - To get a good laugh.</b>

00:28:54.349 --> 00:28:55.649
<b>- Right. - Because they were fascinated.</b>

00:28:55.649 --> 00:28:57.990
<b>Now let's hear from ZICO.</b>

00:28:57.990 --> 00:29:01.819
<b>I wasn't a popular kid because of my looks,</b>

00:29:01.819 --> 00:29:03.659
<b>- but retreats or... - Exactly.</b>

00:29:03.659 --> 00:29:05.730
<b>- at school picnics. - Because you could sing.</b>

00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:08.000
<b>After performing in front of the other kids,</b>

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.460
<b>I'd rise in fame.</b>

00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:11.482
<b>Which song did you perform to?</b>

00:29:11.569 --> 00:29:14.169
<b>"Rising Sun" by TVXQ.</b>

00:29:14.169 --> 00:29:15.169
<b>"Rising Sun"?</b>

00:29:15.169 --> 00:29:17.270
<b>Could you show us how you performed to it?</b>

00:29:17.270 --> 00:29:19.123
<b>I don't remember anymore,</b>

00:29:22.139 --> 00:29:24.280
<b>but it was something like this.</b>

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:26.010
<b>Well, he's such a good dancer.</b>

00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:27.450
<b>He looks cool even dancing those small moves.</b>

00:29:27.450 --> 00:29:28.919
<b>Se Chan, how about you?</b>

00:29:28.919 --> 00:29:30.450
<b>In my case...</b>

00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:31.550
<b>How have you been lately?</b>

00:29:31.550 --> 00:29:33.159
<b>- How have I been lately? - Are you good?</b>

00:29:33.159 --> 00:29:34.989
<b>Yes, I've been studying to learn new things.</b>

00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:38.242
<b>I'm not kidding when I say that in high school,</b>

00:29:38.559 --> 00:29:42.283
<b>a group of girls actually...</b>

00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:44.069
<b>fought over me.</b>

00:29:44.069 --> 00:29:45.069
<b>- What? - Why?</b>

00:29:45.069 --> 00:29:47.369
<b>They liked me so much and they all wanted me.</b>

00:29:47.369 --> 00:29:48.740
<b>- What? - They fought over me.</b>

00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:49.869
<b>It's not a joke.</b>

00:29:49.869 --> 00:29:51.809
<b>This is the most hilarious thing you said today.</b>

00:29:51.809 --> 00:29:53.839
<b>Really? So what happened?</b>

00:29:53.839 --> 00:29:56.879
<b>Well, the choice was mine. I had to make a choice.</b>

00:29:56.879 --> 00:29:58.550
<b>After fighting over him,</b>

00:29:58.550 --> 00:30:01.402
<b>they came to the conclusion that it was a draw.</b>

00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:04.349
<b>Just like we predicted,</b>

00:30:04.349 --> 00:30:07.059
<b>a lot of the members on that team will probably be...</b>

00:30:07.059 --> 00:30:08.059
<b>- high up in the rankings. - That's right.</b>

00:30:08.059 --> 00:30:11.190
<b>Let me tell you one hard fact though.</b>

00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:13.099
<b>I went on my first group blind date in high school.</b>

00:30:13.099 --> 00:30:15.313
<b>Was it in Hanyang?</b>

00:30:16.159 --> 00:30:18.300
<b>Yes, we traveled on horses to get there.</b>

00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:19.970
<b>Where did you tie up your horse then?</b>

00:30:19.970 --> 00:30:21.440
<b>- Your horse... - My horse?</b>

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:23.040
<b>- Next to Namdaemun... - He's taking it for now.</b>

00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:24.809
<b>There were trees alongside it.</b>

00:30:24.809 --> 00:30:26.579
<b>- Trees? - What did you do on dates?</b>

00:30:26.579 --> 00:30:27.809
<b>Shoot arrows?</b>

00:30:27.809 --> 00:30:29.180
<b>Or a game of tuho?</b>

00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:30.280
<b>Don't be ridiculous.</b>

00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:32.180
<b>We just wrote down names...</b>

00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:33.603
<b>- on a paper. - Really?</b>

00:30:33.649 --> 00:30:35.363
<b>But you would've had to write it in Chinese characters.</b>

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:38.573
<b>We still wrote in ancient Korean, so don't worry.</b>

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:40.103
<b>Ancient Korean?</b>

00:30:40.290 --> 00:30:41.659
<b>We wrote in Korean, all right?</b>

00:30:41.659 --> 00:30:44.043
<b>The Korean published in Hunminjeongeum.</b>

00:30:44.359 --> 00:30:46.260
<b>That's what we wrote in.</b>

00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:47.300
<b>So three girls wrote your name down?</b>

00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:48.659
<b>Ji Hyo, I bet you were popular in school.</b>

00:30:48.659 --> 00:30:49.730
<b>Of course, right?</b>

00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:51.069
<b>- Me? - She probably was.</b>

00:30:51.069 --> 00:30:52.069
<b>I bet she was popular.</b>

00:30:52.069 --> 00:30:54.482
<b>I never went on group blind dates...</b>

00:30:54.839 --> 00:30:57.770
<b>and no one set me up on blind dates either.</b>

00:30:57.770 --> 00:31:00.280
<b>Popular kids don't know that they're popular.</b>

00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:02.079
<b>- They don't. - Later on in life,</b>

00:31:02.079 --> 00:31:03.849
<b>you realize you were popular.</b>

00:31:03.849 --> 00:31:05.909
<b>She was a cavewoman back then too, so of course, she didn't know.</b>

00:31:05.909 --> 00:31:07.720
<b>I never caught on to those things.</b>

00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:10.750
<b>You probably all know Ji Hyo's photo from high school.</b>

00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:12.419
<b>The one with the slick bangs.</b>

00:31:12.419 --> 00:31:14.460
<b>It looks like she had a temper back then.</b>

00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:16.290
<b>- Tell us how it was. - That was me in high school.</b>

00:31:16.290 --> 00:31:18.829
<b>The middle school I attended had some strict rules.</b>

00:31:18.829 --> 00:31:20.200
<b>Our hair had to be a short bob.</b>

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:22.359
<b>You definitely are older than how you look.</b>

00:31:22.359 --> 00:31:24.629
<b>- Now I'm curious. - Is this you in middle school?</b>

00:31:24.629 --> 00:31:26.069
<b>- Yes, that. - In middle school?</b>

00:31:26.069 --> 00:31:28.752
<b>- No wonder... - I had just been crying.</b>

00:31:28.839 --> 00:31:31.023
<b>- So there you are. - I don't mind your hair though.</b>

00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:32.809
<b>You were pretty.</b>

00:31:32.809 --> 00:31:34.209
<b>So Min, what about you?</b>

00:31:34.210 --> 00:31:36.962
<b>Many think that I was popular in school,</b>

00:31:37.149 --> 00:31:39.609
<b>but my mom never helped me carry the chocolates I received.</b>

00:31:39.609 --> 00:31:42.250
<b>In fact, she helped me make...</b>

00:31:42.250 --> 00:31:44.250
<b>the chocolates I wanted to give to the boy I like.</b>

00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:45.750
<b>I feel bad for your mom.</b>

00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:47.619
<b>- Goodness. - She helped me make them.</b>

00:31:47.619 --> 00:31:49.889
<b>- When it comes to love... - That's right.</b>

00:31:49.889 --> 00:31:51.030
<b>She makes sure she gets it.</b>

00:31:51.030 --> 00:31:53.159
<b>The boys that I liked...</b>

00:31:53.159 --> 00:31:55.200
<b>would like my best friends though.</b>

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:56.260
<b>I have some sad memories.</b>

00:31:56.260 --> 00:31:58.099
<b>So that's what it was like for So Min.</b>

00:31:58.099 --> 00:32:00.639
<b>The boys she liked had feelings for someone else.</b>

00:32:00.639 --> 00:32:02.869
<b>- Jae Seok too. - It was like that for me too.</b>

00:32:02.869 --> 00:32:04.669
<b>- He'd bring up the mood. - Things would heat up,</b>

00:32:04.669 --> 00:32:07.440
<b>but the ladies would choose my friends instead.</b>

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:09.210
<b>Jong Kook, weren't you popular too?</b>

00:32:09.210 --> 00:32:10.609
<b>- Most definitely. - Well,</b>

00:32:10.609 --> 00:32:11.849
<b>I...</b>

00:32:11.849 --> 00:32:13.349
<b>- Of course, he was famous. - Older girls were more fond of me.</b>

00:32:13.349 --> 00:32:15.363
<b>That suits you though.</b>

00:32:15.450 --> 00:32:17.290
<b>Nothing can be better than that.</b>

00:32:17.290 --> 00:32:19.250
<b>There was a salon I'd go to when I was in high school.</b>

00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:20.559
<b>- He's on a different level. - The hairstylists?</b>

00:32:20.559 --> 00:32:21.990
<b>- The older girls there... - The hairstylists?</b>

00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:24.559
<b>- Yes, in their early 20s. - They were adults then.</b>

00:32:24.559 --> 00:32:26.659
<b>Yes, older girls liked me when I was in high school.</b>

00:32:26.659 --> 00:32:28.829
<b>It's probably because you managed the store.</b>

00:32:28.829 --> 00:32:29.912
<b>(That's why.)</b>

00:32:30.169 --> 00:32:31.669
<b>I bet you were cool back then.</b>

00:32:31.669 --> 00:32:33.300
<b>You managed salons too?</b>

00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:35.200
<b>- You managed stores? - Really?</b>

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:37.909
<b>- No, hold on. - I had no idea.</b>

00:32:37.909 --> 00:32:39.369
<b>You managed the salon for them?</b>

00:32:39.369 --> 00:32:41.280
<b>- Is that what you did? - Anyway,</b>

00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:42.639
<b>older girls were more fond of me.</b>

00:32:42.639 --> 00:32:44.263
<b>It's so believable though.</b>

00:32:44.349 --> 00:32:45.450
<b>So now...</b>

00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:48.250
<b>Yes, go ahead and predict where you would be on the ranking.</b>

00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:50.250
<b>- Our own? - Yes, guess your own ranking.</b>

00:32:50.250 --> 00:32:52.349
<b>Just know that we need to win this round.</b>

00:32:52.349 --> 00:32:54.242
<b>We have to guess our own ranking correctly.</b>

00:32:54.359 --> 00:32:56.930
<b>Most of us are probably high up.</b>

00:32:56.930 --> 00:32:58.190
<b>We're high up in the ranking.</b>

00:32:58.190 --> 00:33:00.460
<b>- But... - Kwang Soo and I...</b>

00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:02.159
<b>- Exactly. - We'll be low on the ranking.</b>

00:33:02.159 --> 00:33:04.669
<b>Jae Seok could be high up in the ranking though...</b>

00:33:04.669 --> 00:33:05.869
<b>since he's funny.</b>

00:33:05.869 --> 00:33:07.440
<b>- Right? - The funny ones...</b>

00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:08.899
<b>were popular in school.</b>

00:33:08.899 --> 00:33:11.540
<b>- I bet he's in the top three. - Let's start with Seok Jin.</b>

00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:13.069
<b>I...</b>

00:33:13.069 --> 00:33:15.680
<b>- It's all about guessing correctly. - But Seok Jin's well-known,</b>

00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:17.550
<b>- so... - In my case...</b>

00:33:17.550 --> 00:33:20.050
<b>Our team needs to win, so I'll put myself in ninth place.</b>

00:33:20.050 --> 00:33:22.020
<b>You think three are beneath you in the ranking?</b>

00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:23.773
<b>- Eighth place? - To be honest,</b>

00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:26.149
<b>I think you're probably in 10th place.</b>

00:33:26.149 --> 00:33:27.359
<b>Shut it.</b>

00:33:27.359 --> 00:33:28.472
<b>(Mr. Popular explodes.)</b>

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:30.559
<b>- The choice is yours. - I was quite popular, you know.</b>

00:33:30.559 --> 00:33:31.930
<b>Go with your gut then.</b>

00:33:31.930 --> 00:33:34.658
<b>- I was popular with the ladies. - Go with your gut.</b>

00:33:34.659 --> 00:33:36.300
<b>- Follow your gut. - Okay.</b>

00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:37.369
<b>(He trusts his gut...)</b>

00:33:37.369 --> 00:33:38.829
<b>(and puts himself in 7th place.)</b>

00:33:38.829 --> 00:33:41.152
<b>No, don't be like that!</b>

00:33:41.169 --> 00:33:43.669
<b>- His gut? - You told me to follow my gut!</b>

00:33:43.669 --> 00:33:45.869
<b>- I know I said that, but... - If I'm being honest,</b>

00:33:45.869 --> 00:33:47.280
<b>- this is where I should be. - Stop it.</b>

00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:49.809
<b>- But your gut feeling is wrong! - This is what my gut is telling me.</b>

00:33:49.809 --> 00:33:51.409
<b>Add a splash of conscience too.</b>

00:33:51.409 --> 00:33:53.149
<b>- Exactly. - I'll add a lot of it.</b>

00:33:53.149 --> 00:33:54.449
<b>- Exactly. - Add some conscience.</b>

00:33:54.450 --> 00:33:55.849
<b>- Okay! - Nice.</b>

00:33:55.849 --> 00:33:57.990
<b>- Happy now? - Yes, we're good.</b>

00:33:57.990 --> 00:34:00.043
<b>- Okay, fine. - It's so that the team can win.</b>

00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:02.919
<b>Ji Hyo, don't be too modest.</b>

00:34:02.919 --> 00:34:04.859
<b>- Ji Hyo... - Don't be modest.</b>

00:34:04.859 --> 00:34:07.659
<b>It only makes sense that you're high up in the ranking.</b>

00:34:07.659 --> 00:34:09.359
<b>What is your take on this?</b>

00:34:09.359 --> 00:34:10.783
<b>- Me? - Yes.</b>

00:34:11.169 --> 00:34:13.152
<b>Just be honest with us.</b>

00:34:14.039 --> 00:34:15.169
<b>First place?</b>

00:34:15.169 --> 00:34:16.910
<b>(1st place?)</b>

00:34:16.910 --> 00:34:18.069
<b>Nice one!</b>

00:34:18.069 --> 00:34:19.870
<b>- Do it then. - Put yourself in first place.</b>

00:34:19.870 --> 00:34:21.280
<b>- Go ahead. - You should.</b>

00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:23.010
<b>- Go for first place. - Look how brazen you are.</b>

00:34:23.010 --> 00:34:24.749
<b>I truly believe...</b>

00:34:24.749 --> 00:34:27.050
<b>- I'm in first place. - I love that about you.</b>

00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:29.619
<b>You should do whatever you want regardless of what others think.</b>

00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:31.649
<b>- No matter what others say... - Regardless?</b>

00:34:31.649 --> 00:34:32.720
<b>- Be yourself. - Go for it.</b>

00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:33.990
<b>- First place. - Prettier kids...</b>

00:34:33.990 --> 00:34:36.272
<b>- were most popular in school. - Right.</b>

00:34:36.359 --> 00:34:38.760
<b>So Min is probably high up on the ranking too.</b>

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:39.959
<b>So Min, just follow your gut.</b>

00:34:39.959 --> 00:34:42.530
<b>I think I could be in third place.</b>

00:34:42.530 --> 00:34:44.899
<b>(Laughing hysterically)</b>

00:34:44.899 --> 00:34:47.269
<b>- Unbelievable. - Why are you laughing?</b>

00:34:47.269 --> 00:34:49.569
<b>- I'm pretty, you know. - Yes, I know that.</b>

00:34:49.569 --> 00:34:51.669
<b>(You're the only one who doesn't know.)</b>

00:34:51.669 --> 00:34:53.209
<b>Can't I even laugh now?</b>

00:34:53.209 --> 00:34:55.680
<b>- "I'm pretty, you know." - You never know though.</b>

00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:58.910
<b>So Min was adorable as a kid, so she was probably popular.</b>

00:34:58.910 --> 00:35:00.180
<b>- I agree. - Third place.</b>

00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:02.902
<b>- I bet you were popular. - Wouldn't second place be better?</b>

00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:06.249
<b>I think I could be higher in the ranking,</b>

00:35:06.249 --> 00:35:08.060
<b>but I'll settle for this.</b>

00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:09.772
<b>Team Kwang Soo, you're up.</b>

00:35:10.089 --> 00:35:12.143
<b>- This is a team game, guys. - We know.</b>

00:35:12.189 --> 00:35:14.343
<b>Let us be objective, okay?</b>

00:35:14.459 --> 00:35:16.883
<b>Personally, I believe in you.</b>

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:19.069
<b>I bet you're in seconds place.</b>

00:35:19.069 --> 00:35:21.439
<b>I was quite popular in school, you know.</b>

00:35:21.439 --> 00:35:23.470
<b>- I bet you were. - You're tall so...</b>

00:35:23.470 --> 00:35:26.010
<b>- They're trying to fool you. - I liked to joke around too.</b>

00:35:26.010 --> 00:35:27.180
<b>This is a trap.</b>

00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:28.993
<b>Why would you think that way?</b>

00:35:29.539 --> 00:35:31.249
<b>Because they think I should be high up?</b>

00:35:31.249 --> 00:35:33.010
<b>Anyway, keep in mind that this is a team game.</b>

00:35:33.010 --> 00:35:34.879
<b>- You're in 2nd place. - 2nd place sounds good.</b>

00:35:34.879 --> 00:35:36.819
<b>- Second place sounds good. - Where's your confidence?</b>

00:35:36.819 --> 00:35:38.133
<b>Of course, you're in second place.</b>

00:35:38.189 --> 00:35:39.519
<b>- Right? - Go for it.</b>

00:35:39.519 --> 00:35:40.919
<b>I'm not sure but...</b>

00:35:40.919 --> 00:35:42.660
<b>You're in second place. Gosh.</b>

00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:44.060
<b>So what?</b>

00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:45.060
<b>I'm putting myself in second place.</b>

00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:46.459
<b>He's being ridiculous.</b>

00:35:46.459 --> 00:35:48.913
<b>The team leader has no consideration for his team.</b>

00:35:49.430 --> 00:35:51.669
<b>There's no one in the lower rankings.</b>

00:35:51.669 --> 00:35:53.030
<b>- First place. - Seong Wu.</b>

00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:55.370
<b>- First place! - Don't be modest.</b>

00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:56.953
<b>This isn't me being modest.</b>

00:35:58.039 --> 00:36:01.910
<b>I just think that the members of Running Man...</b>

00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:04.133
<b>have a better chance to be higher up in the ranking.</b>

00:36:04.149 --> 00:36:06.010
<b>- What? - No way!</b>

00:36:06.010 --> 00:36:09.203
<b>If that's the case, you'll be in ninth place.</b>

00:36:09.649 --> 00:36:11.089
<b>- We're a group of eight. - Not all of them.</b>

00:36:11.089 --> 00:36:12.732
<b>- Is that so? - Seok Jin.</b>

00:36:12.789 --> 00:36:14.160
<b>Not you.</b>

00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:15.359
<b>- Not you. - Quietly but firmly...</b>

00:36:15.359 --> 00:36:18.013
<b>I still think I'm better looking than some of you.</b>

00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:19.060
<b>So not me, then.</b>

00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:20.359
<b>- I'm loving your style. - Nice one.</b>

00:36:20.359 --> 00:36:21.459
<b>That's him being modest too.</b>

00:36:21.459 --> 00:36:23.343
<b>You could be right though.</b>

00:36:23.669 --> 00:36:25.100
<b>Don't forget that you played basketball.</b>

00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:27.039
<b>- He was actually popular in school. - Right.</b>

00:36:27.039 --> 00:36:29.039
<b>Do Hyun, just think about how you really were.</b>

00:36:29.039 --> 00:36:32.269
<b>People don't approach me easily though...</b>

00:36:32.269 --> 00:36:36.039
<b>because they find me to be quite cold at first.</b>

00:36:36.039 --> 00:36:38.249
<b>- So I wasn't... - What's your estimate ranking?</b>

00:36:38.249 --> 00:36:41.163
<b>Well, about 4th or 5th place?</b>

00:36:41.450 --> 00:36:43.419
<b>That high up when you think you weren't popular?</b>

00:36:43.419 --> 00:36:45.850
<b>- Unbelievable. - Are you kidding me?</b>

00:36:45.850 --> 00:36:47.819
<b>It's right for popular kids to say that.</b>

00:36:47.819 --> 00:36:49.759
<b>- He's not like us. - "About 4th or 5th?"</b>

00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:51.359
<b>Unbelievable.</b>

00:36:51.359 --> 00:36:53.760
<b>If we started off by saying that,</b>

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:55.160
<b>we would've said "below ninth."</b>

00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:56.260
<b>I'll go for fourth place.</b>

00:36:56.260 --> 00:36:57.569
<b>Sure, fourth place.</b>

00:36:57.569 --> 00:36:58.970
<b>All right.</b>

00:36:58.970 --> 00:37:00.569
<b>- Good one. - How modest.</b>

00:37:00.569 --> 00:37:01.970
<b>ZICO, you're next.</b>

00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:03.039
<b>I think you'll be in first place.</b>

00:37:03.039 --> 00:37:06.109
<b>ZICO's song has been trending these days.</b>

00:37:06.109 --> 00:37:09.062
<b>I'm sure everyone has heard "Any Song" by now.</b>

00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:10.479
<b>- Then... - It's third place for me.</b>

00:37:10.479 --> 00:37:11.609
<b>- Third place? - Yes.</b>

00:37:11.609 --> 00:37:13.280
<b>People will criticize Kwang Soo now.</b>

00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:15.419
<b>You said you expected to be high up.</b>

00:37:15.419 --> 00:37:18.450
<b>I can't believe you threw me under the bus like this.</b>

00:37:18.450 --> 00:37:20.660
<b>- But you're our team leader. - What?</b>

00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:23.143
<b>- You're our team leader. - You're the worst, you know.</b>

00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:25.942
<b>- Se Chan's up. - He doesn't have much of a choice.</b>

00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:27.530
<b>I'm definitely higher up than Seok Jin.</b>

00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:29.300
<b>- So eighth place. - He should be beneath me.</b>

00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:31.269
<b>His estimate isn't modest at all.</b>

00:37:31.269 --> 00:37:32.970
<b>- Go for 8th place. - Yes, 8th place.</b>

00:37:32.970 --> 00:37:34.652
<b>- Right. - It's not so bad.</b>

00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:36.383
<b>- All right. - Okay.</b>

00:37:37.209 --> 00:37:38.939
<b>(Who Was Most Popular in School?)</b>

00:37:38.939 --> 00:37:40.310
<b>So we now have the result.</b>

00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:42.780
<b>If we put ourselves too high up in the ranking...</b>

00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:44.609
<b>- Tell me about it. - I don't know...</b>

00:37:44.609 --> 00:37:47.148
<b>who's in 12th place, but that person should just leave.</b>

00:37:47.149 --> 00:37:48.249
<b>- Here we go then. - Sure.</b>

00:37:48.249 --> 00:37:49.419
<b>Let me reveal the result.</b>

00:37:49.419 --> 00:37:50.549
<b>One...</b>

00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:51.550
<b>(Which team guessed the most answers correctly?)</b>

00:37:51.550 --> 00:37:52.649
<b>Two...</b>

00:37:52.649 --> 00:37:56.459
<b>(Which team guessed the most answers correctly?)</b>

00:37:56.459 --> 00:37:57.743
<b>Three.</b>

00:37:58.089 --> 00:37:59.959
<b>(A blast of air)</b>

00:37:59.959 --> 00:38:01.913
<b>(Jong Kook's eyes open wide.)</b>

00:38:01.959 --> 00:38:03.059
<b>Okay!</b>

00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:04.913
<b>- We win again! - Again?</b>

00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:07.252
<b>- Gosh. - Let me show you the result.</b>

00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:08.640
<b>- What's that? - Here it comes.</b>

00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:09.740
<b>- What? - Seok Jin...</b>

00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:11.252
<b>I got it right!</b>

00:38:11.709 --> 00:38:13.640
<b>- I'm in 11th place. Gosh. - I'm in 7th place.</b>

00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:15.179
<b>- I'm in 5th place. My gosh. - Gosh.</b>

00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:16.410
<b>Ji Hyo, you got it right.</b>

00:38:16.410 --> 00:38:18.350
<b>- Do Hyun is in 10th place. - I'm in 2nd place.</b>

00:38:18.350 --> 00:38:19.979
<b>That was close. ZICO is in 3rd place.</b>

00:38:19.979 --> 00:38:21.763
<b>- ZICO got it right. - He got it right.</b>

00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:25.350
<b>(From Team Lee Kwang Soo, ZICO and Ji Hun got their places right.)</b>

00:38:25.350 --> 00:38:28.620
<b>(From Team Jee Seok Jin, Ji Hyo is the only one who got it right.)</b>

00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:29.889
<b>(ZICO, Ji Hun, Ji Hyo)</b>

00:38:29.890 --> 00:38:31.088
<b>Kwang Soo.</b>

00:38:31.089 --> 00:38:32.513
<b>Kwang Soo, look at that.</b>

00:38:33.129 --> 00:38:35.100
<b>- Kwang Soo. - Gosh.</b>

00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:36.830
<b>The survey wasn't done very well.</b>

00:38:36.830 --> 00:38:38.069
<b>This is serious.</b>

00:38:38.069 --> 00:38:39.582
<b>- Do Hyun is in 10th place. - All right.</b>

00:38:40.370 --> 00:38:41.800
<b>Do Hyun is hilarious.</b>

00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:43.709
<b>He guessed he'd be in 4th or 5th place.</b>

00:38:43.709 --> 00:38:45.493
<b>After bragging about receiving sports drinks and everything...</b>

00:38:46.109 --> 00:38:47.479
<b>You should never be arrogant.</b>

00:38:47.479 --> 00:38:48.810
<b>- Do Hyun is so funny. - You should be humble.</b>

00:38:48.810 --> 00:38:49.939
<b>Let me explain.</b>

00:38:49.939 --> 00:38:52.593
<b>People in their 20s cast the most votes for ZICO.</b>

00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:54.580
<b>- I knew it. - But all the other age groups...</b>

00:38:54.580 --> 00:38:55.919
<b>cast the most votes for Ji Hyo.</b>

00:38:55.919 --> 00:38:58.319
<b>- Ji Hyo, you're incredible. - Ji Hyo is strong.</b>

00:38:58.319 --> 00:39:01.319
<b>Also, all the age groups cast the fewest votes for Seok Jin.</b>

00:39:01.319 --> 00:39:02.419
<b>(Seok Jin got the fewest votes from all the age groups.)</b>

00:39:02.419 --> 00:39:03.843
<b>You're below me.</b>

00:39:04.229 --> 00:39:05.830
<b>I understand that.</b>

00:39:05.830 --> 00:39:08.430
<b>- They don't know what I was like. - He's angry.</b>

00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:09.530
<b>That's understandable.</b>

00:39:09.530 --> 00:39:11.269
<b>Okay, I get it now. So this is how it works.</b>

00:39:11.269 --> 00:39:12.499
<b>I get it now.</b>

00:39:12.499 --> 00:39:13.823
<b>Here's the second question.</b>

00:39:13.839 --> 00:39:16.269
<b>"Who would be the most boring at clubs?"</b>

00:39:16.269 --> 00:39:19.192
<b>(Who would be the most boring at clubs?)</b>

00:39:19.539 --> 00:39:20.709
<b>(I'm super fun!)</b>

00:39:20.709 --> 00:39:22.493
<b>- Wait. - This question...</b>

00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:24.649
<b>For this question,</b>

00:39:24.649 --> 00:39:26.393
<b>- I'll definitely be near the top. - I will be in the lower ranks.</b>

00:39:26.479 --> 00:39:28.319
<b>So fun people are supposed to be at the bottom, right?</b>

00:39:28.319 --> 00:39:30.120
<b>What are you guys like? Kwang Soo.</b>

00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:31.390
<b>What do you do at clubs?</b>

00:39:31.390 --> 00:39:33.248
<b>I'm kind of tall,</b>

00:39:33.249 --> 00:39:35.542
<b>so I attract a lot of attention.</b>

00:39:35.819 --> 00:39:36.990
<b>So what exactly do you do?</b>

00:39:36.990 --> 00:39:39.343
<b>Around me...</b>

00:39:39.589 --> 00:39:41.942
<b>Are you pretentious or frivolous? What are you like?</b>

00:39:41.959 --> 00:39:43.613
<b>I'm pretentious and frivolous.</b>

00:39:44.229 --> 00:39:45.330
<b>I'm both.</b>

00:39:45.330 --> 00:39:46.830
<b>You're pretentious and frivolous?</b>

00:39:46.830 --> 00:39:48.482
<b>- You're P and F. - I'm P and F.</b>

00:39:48.839 --> 00:39:50.200
<b>You're P and F?</b>

00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:51.823
<b>- Yes. - You're P and F.</b>

00:39:51.939 --> 00:39:54.240
<b>First of all, I put on...</b>

00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:56.263
<b>all the designer clothes I have at home and head out.</b>

00:39:56.839 --> 00:39:58.332
<b>I want to stand out.</b>

00:39:58.550 --> 00:39:59.649
<b>First of all...</b>

00:39:59.649 --> 00:40:01.680
<b>"That guy is wearing such strong perfume."</b>

00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:04.033
<b>He wears a lot of designer clothes.</b>

00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:06.390
<b>That's so old-fashioned.</b>

00:40:06.390 --> 00:40:08.459
<b>It's just to send a signal to the girls.</b>

00:40:08.459 --> 00:40:09.919
<b>- "Here I am." - "I'm cool."</b>

00:40:09.919 --> 00:40:11.390
<b>- You're a show-off. - Also,</b>

00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:13.359
<b>if I just dance to the rhythm,</b>

00:40:13.359 --> 00:40:14.712
<b>people don't really notice me.</b>

00:40:14.830 --> 00:40:16.629
<b>As soon as I enter, I shout even louder than the music.</b>

00:40:16.629 --> 00:40:19.082
<b>(Shouting)</b>

00:40:19.899 --> 00:40:23.039
<b>(He attracts attention by shouting and wearing designer clothes.)</b>

00:40:23.039 --> 00:40:24.240
<b>"Here I am!"</b>

00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:25.339
<b>People look at me.</b>

00:40:25.339 --> 00:40:28.562
<b>Hey, come on!</b>

00:40:28.580 --> 00:40:30.039
<b>Here we go!</b>

00:40:30.039 --> 00:40:31.562
<b>Let's go!</b>

00:40:31.979 --> 00:40:34.620
<b>(He is pretentious and old-fashioned.)</b>

00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:35.962
<b>He shouts that at a club?</b>

00:40:36.149 --> 00:40:38.102
<b>In the end, I'm surrounded by about 200 people,</b>

00:40:38.149 --> 00:40:39.288
<b>- all shouting. - Excuse me.</b>

00:40:39.289 --> 00:40:42.143
<b>- Excuse me. Do you work at a club? - No.</b>

00:40:42.359 --> 00:40:44.129
<b>- I go there to have fun. - Do you carry things there?</b>

00:40:44.129 --> 00:40:45.890
<b>- No, I just have fun. - Then why do you shout...</b>

00:40:45.890 --> 00:40:47.200
<b>It's just to get in the mood.</b>

00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:49.613
<b>I think I've seen someone like him in front of a club.</b>

00:40:49.629 --> 00:40:51.069
<b>You're like me.</b>

00:40:51.069 --> 00:40:52.783
<b>- I shout a lot too. - You should.</b>

00:40:52.830 --> 00:40:54.053
<b>- Here we go. - Here we go.</b>

00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:55.800
<b>Here we go!</b>

00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:57.752
<b>(They look like middle-aged men after a team dinner.)</b>

00:40:58.209 --> 00:40:59.810
<b>- That's right. - But you two...</b>

00:40:59.810 --> 00:41:01.010
<b>Both of you would be near the bottom.</b>

00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:02.863
<b>- Se Chan too. - Then...</b>

00:41:02.910 --> 00:41:05.050
<b>give us some music, and we'll talk about what we do.</b>

<b>(Running Man Club is open.)</b>

<b>- It's club music. - Kwang Soo.</b>

<b>- 1 by 1... - I just...</b>

00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:10.803
<b>(This is what P and F does at a club.)</b>

00:41:12.789 --> 00:41:14.942
<b>(He pretends to be attractive.)</b>

00:41:15.789 --> 00:41:17.772
<b>He hasn't done this a lot.</b>

00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:20.042
<b>- Gosh. - I can't stand it.</b>

00:41:21.499 --> 00:41:23.643
<b>(Do you want to dance with me?)</b>

00:41:24.830 --> 00:41:27.140
<b>(He hits on someone with his eyes out of focus.)</b>

00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:28.953
<b>I've been to a club with him, and he actually does that.</b>

<b>(Input error: You like me?)</b>

00:41:32.769 --> 00:41:34.810
<b>(He moves his body in a weird way while looking into space.)</b>

00:41:34.810 --> 00:41:36.039
<b>What is this?</b>

00:41:36.039 --> 00:41:38.108
<b>- He doesn't know how to have fun. - Hold on.</b>

<b>Haha, only a few people think you are like Sean.</b>

00:48:03.300 --> 00:48:05.530
<b>Only your close friends think that.</b>

00:48:05.530 --> 00:48:06.700
<b>(Only his close friends think he is a loving husband.)</b>

00:48:06.700 --> 00:48:07.999
<b>What do you mean Haha is like Sean?</b>

00:48:07.999 --> 00:48:09.700
<b>He said his image is like that of Sean.</b>

00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:10.922
<b>What kind of nonsense is that?</b>

00:48:10.939 --> 00:48:12.209
<b>- Seriously. - That's ridiculous.</b>

00:48:12.209 --> 00:48:13.839
<b>- Only my close friends think that. - That's right.</b>

00:48:13.839 --> 00:48:16.192
<b>- The public doesn't know that. - No, it doesn't.</b>

00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:19.709
<b>Thus, Team Lee Kwang Soo won.</b>

00:48:19.709 --> 00:48:21.249
<b>(Team Lee Kwang Soo won the 2nd round.)</b>

00:48:21.249 --> 00:48:22.602
<b>Yes!</b>

00:48:22.780 --> 00:48:24.319
<b>Team Lee Kwang Soo will submit 15 R coins...</b>

00:48:24.319 --> 00:48:27.743
<b>and Team Jee Seok Jin will submit 20 R coins.</b>

00:48:27.819 --> 00:48:29.859
<b>- Se Chan, go first. - Shall I go first?</b>

00:48:29.859 --> 00:48:31.089
<b>- Okay. - Shall we go in this order?</b>

00:48:31.089 --> 00:48:33.042
<b>I know Se Chan will make the right choice.</b>

00:48:33.189 --> 00:48:35.530
<b>Gosh, I didn't want to go first.</b>

00:48:35.530 --> 00:48:37.030
<b>(The first person's choice will affect everyone who follows.)</b>

00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:39.712
<b>(What will be Se Chan's choice?)</b>

00:48:39.999 --> 00:48:41.069
<b>- You are done, right? - I am done.</b>

00:48:41.069 --> 00:48:42.800
<b>- ZICO, go right ahead. - Okay.</b>

00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:44.553
<b>ZICO, I don't doubt you.</b>

00:48:47.069 --> 00:48:51.192
<b>(Will ZICO remain loyal?)</b>

00:48:53.149 --> 00:48:55.933
<b>Look at Ji Hun. He is taking out R coins as he goes.</b>

00:48:56.249 --> 00:48:57.519
<b>People who pay up are different.</b>

00:48:57.519 --> 00:49:01.542
<b>(Seong Wu submits R coins last.)</b>

00:49:03.289 --> 00:49:04.573
<b>(My goodness.)</b>

00:49:05.189 --> 00:49:06.660
<b>- How many were there? - How many did you submit?</b>

00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:08.129
<b>How many did you submit?</b>

00:49:08.129 --> 00:49:09.129
<b>What is it, Seong Wu?</b>

00:49:09.129 --> 00:49:11.069
<b>- Go, Kwang Soo. - I don't doubt you guys.</b>

00:49:11.069 --> 00:49:12.129
<b>(Is Seong Wu shocked due to the number of R coins?)</b>

00:49:12.129 --> 00:49:13.283
<b>If you didn't pay up...</b>

00:49:13.870 --> 00:49:16.383
<b>I... Kwang Soo.</b>

00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:18.453
<b>I had no choice.</b>

00:49:19.209 --> 00:49:21.093
<b>- I had no choice either. - I...</b>

00:49:21.879 --> 00:49:25.109
<b>(It's time to check the number of submitted R coins.)</b>

00:49:25.109 --> 00:49:26.450
<b>(The current number of R coins)</b>

00:49:26.450 --> 00:49:28.933
<b>(Only 1)</b>

00:49:29.979 --> 00:49:31.672
<b>You jerks!</b>

00:49:32.589 --> 00:49:34.789
<b>(He gives an angry shout.)</b>

00:49:34.789 --> 00:49:35.990
<b>That startled me. What is it?</b>

00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:37.743
<b>Let's break off the team.</b>

00:49:37.830 --> 00:49:39.959
<b>- Why? What is it like? - What is it like?</b>

00:49:39.959 --> 00:49:41.183
<b>You know,</b>

00:49:41.330 --> 00:49:42.800
<b>this number is ridiculous.</b>

00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:43.982
<b>(We aren't a team.)</b>

00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:48.053
<b>Failing to catch the traitor would be harder.</b>

00:49:48.499 --> 00:49:50.883
<b>- I will catch the traitor. - How many R coins are there?</b>

00:49:50.910 --> 00:49:53.022
<b>- Four? - Shut it!</b>

00:49:53.339 --> 00:49:54.910
<b>We aren't a team.</b>

00:49:54.910 --> 00:49:56.080
<b>(He is seething due to the shocking result.)</b>

00:49:56.080 --> 00:49:58.748
<b>- I can't believe them. - Well done.</b>

00:49:58.749 --> 00:49:59.979
<b>- What a twist! - Catch the traitor.</b>

00:49:59.979 --> 00:50:02.220
<b>Will you pay for everything or catch the member who paid less?</b>

00:50:02.220 --> 00:50:03.332
<b>I will catch the traitor.</b>

00:50:03.580 --> 00:50:05.249
<b>- I will catch the traitor. - Please pick one.</b>

00:50:05.249 --> 00:50:06.249
<b>(4 out of 5 members submitted 0 R coins.)</b>

00:50:06.249 --> 00:50:08.289
<b>There are so many suspects.</b>

00:50:08.289 --> 00:50:09.419
<b>I guess someone submitted zero R coins.</b>

00:50:09.419 --> 00:50:11.689
<b>I think the lowest number is either 1 or 0.</b>

00:50:11.689 --> 00:50:14.712
<b>I will let you defend yourself one last time.</b>

00:50:15.129 --> 00:50:17.042
<b>I know how many coins Se Chan submitted.</b>

00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:19.312
<b>- ZICO could be lying. - So...</b>

00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:24.053
<b>I submitted as much as Se Chan did.</b>

00:50:24.609 --> 00:50:26.140
<b>(You little...)</b>

00:50:26.140 --> 00:50:27.252
<b>Don't curse!</b>

00:50:27.439 --> 00:50:28.810
<b>(A sense of betrayal makes him curse.)</b>

00:50:28.810 --> 00:50:29.879
<b>Don't curse!</b>

00:50:29.879 --> 00:50:31.910
<b>There are two loaches!</b>

00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:33.910
<b>I am sorry. I am sorry.</b>

00:50:33.910 --> 00:50:35.163
<b>- That's not true. - Hey!</b>

00:50:36.019 --> 00:50:38.133
<b>- My goodness. - Don't let him fool you.</b>

00:50:38.189 --> 00:50:40.732
<b>Listen, Kwang Soo. Earlier...</b>

00:50:41.019 --> 00:50:43.372
<b>- Do Hyun. - We started off on the wrong foot.</b>

00:50:43.589 --> 00:50:45.359
<b>- You know what I mean, right? - For goodness' sake.</b>

00:50:45.359 --> 00:50:46.442
<b>What did you do?</b>

00:50:46.459 --> 00:50:49.600
<b>I had no choice but to follow.</b>

00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:51.200
<b>(Kwang Soo is speechless.)</b>

00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:53.529
<b>- And... - How many coins are there in total?</b>

00:50:53.530 --> 00:50:56.370
<b>And I saw the need to get back on the right track.</b>

00:50:56.370 --> 00:50:58.410
<b>- So you... - You have an idea now, right?</b>

00:50:58.410 --> 00:50:59.993
<b>- Are you saying you paid up? - Yes.</b>

00:51:00.740 --> 00:51:03.039
<b>- How many coins did you pay up? - I can't tell you that.</b>

00:51:03.039 --> 00:51:05.479
<b>How many coins did you pay up? Tell me honestly.</b>

00:51:05.479 --> 00:51:06.593
<b>No.</b>

00:51:07.749 --> 00:51:08.933
<b>Tell me!</b>

00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:10.863
<b>- Tell me! How many coins? - I can't tell you.</b>

00:51:11.089 --> 00:51:13.473
<b>I see why your mom grabbed you by your hair.</b>

00:51:14.289 --> 00:51:16.803
<b>- I see why your mom did it. - I can't tell you.</b>

00:51:17.089 --> 00:51:18.990
<b>Seong Wu can't even laugh comfortably.</b>

00:51:18.990 --> 00:51:21.229
<b>- I am... - I know. He is nervous.</b>

00:51:21.229 --> 00:51:24.553
<b>the first person...</b>

00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:27.283
<b>who didn't follow the wrong trend.</b>

00:51:27.300 --> 00:51:29.122
<b>- You are saying you paid up. - Yes.</b>

00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:31.970
<b>- He is trying his best to survive. - Seong Wu submitted two coins.</b>

00:51:31.970 --> 00:51:33.010
<b>Really?</b>

00:51:33.010 --> 00:51:35.539
<b>My guess is 0, 0, 1, 1, and 2 coins. Did I get it right?</b>

00:51:35.539 --> 00:51:38.232
<b>- The wrong trend... - You are close.</b>

00:51:38.510 --> 00:51:40.209
<b>- Did I get it right? - Kwang Soo looks upset.</b>

00:51:40.209 --> 00:51:41.519
<b>No, no. That can't be right.</b>

00:51:41.519 --> 00:51:44.033
<b>I wouldn't be so angry if that's the case.</b>

00:51:44.950 --> 00:51:46.990
<b>- Is it worse? - Is it worse?</b>

00:51:46.990 --> 00:51:49.243
<b>- My goodness. - Is it worse?</b>

00:51:49.359 --> 00:51:52.160
<b>Then you should pick anyone.</b>

00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:53.789
<b>He should just pick one of them.</b>

00:51:53.789 --> 00:51:55.129
<b>(Failing to catch the traitor would be harder.)</b>

00:51:55.129 --> 00:51:56.783
<b>This isn't a team. For goodness' sake.</b>

00:51:57.999 --> 00:52:00.499
<b>I will pick 1 of these 3.</b>

00:52:00.499 --> 00:52:02.122
<b>- Okay. - One of us?</b>

00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:03.769
<b>I told you that we started off on the wrong foot.</b>

00:52:03.769 --> 00:52:05.240
<b>- Don't be ridiculous. - You started off on the wrong foot?</b>

00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:07.422
<b>Tell me how many coins you submitted and I won't pick you.</b>

00:52:07.879 --> 00:52:09.479
<b>- How many coins? - I will whisper it in your ear.</b>

00:52:09.479 --> 00:52:10.823
<b>I don't want the others to know.</b>

00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:13.310
<b>He can lie, so it doesn't matter.</b>

00:52:13.310 --> 00:52:16.350
<b>I pick Do Hyun.</b>

00:52:16.350 --> 00:52:18.272
<b>(My goodness.)</b>

00:52:18.749 --> 00:52:19.902
<b>I pick Do Hyun.</b>

00:52:20.149 --> 00:52:21.743
<b>- It's you. - Why do you think that?</b>

00:52:21.859 --> 00:52:24.319
<b>What he whispered in my ear makes no sense.</b>

00:52:24.319 --> 00:52:25.442
<b>It's you.</b>

00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:27.143
<b>- It's you. I pick Do Hyun. - But...</b>

00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:29.029
<b>- we started off on the wrong foot. - Do Hyun.</b>

00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:30.513
<b>Kwang Soo,</b>

<b>(Will Kwang Soo succeed to apprehend the traitor?)</b>

00:52:31.530 --> 00:52:32.700
<b>you have...</b>

00:52:32.701 --> 00:52:34.784
<b>(Will Kwang Soo succeed to apprehend the traitor?)</b>

00:52:36.919 --> 00:52:39.820
<b>- successfully picked your traitor. - Okay!</b>

<b>(Sighing)</b>

00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:42.590
<b>- You... - Se Chan!</b>

00:52:42.590 --> 00:52:43.990
<b>- Seriously. - You shouldn't be that way!</b>

00:52:43.990 --> 00:52:45.729
<b>- What are you talking about? - You shouldn't be that way!</b>

<b>Do Hyun,</b>

<b>go to the Cashier's office and pay up the rest of the R coins.</b>

<b>It annoyed me that he lied.</b>

00:52:51.769 --> 00:52:53.412
<b>Everyone submitted zero coins.</b>

00:52:54.039 --> 00:52:55.452
<b>- For goodness' sake. - Go.</b>

00:52:56.099 --> 00:52:59.022
<b>(Since Do Hyun has been apprehended as the traitor,)</b>

00:52:59.769 --> 00:53:02.963
<b>(he submits 14 R coins.)</b>

00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:06.233
<b>(Seong Wu was the person who submitted 1 R coin.)</b>

00:53:06.349 --> 00:53:07.720
<b>- Let's go. - All right.</b>

00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:08.820
<b>Ji Hyo should go first.</b>

00:53:08.820 --> 00:53:10.150
<b>We need to start off on the right foot.</b>

<b>- Ji Hyo, can you pay two R coins? - I will...</b>

<b>- I will do that. - Let's do this right.</b>

00:53:12.889 --> 00:53:13.889
<b>(They submit R coins in turn.)</b>

00:53:13.889 --> 00:53:15.872
<b>- Our total was 1 R coin. - 1 R coin.</b>

<b>(There are 8 R coins in total.)</b>

<b>Okay.</b>

<b>Go ahead.</b>

<b>(Haha had submitted 0 R coins. He pays up 12 R coins.)</b>

<b>Trust the Piggy Banks.</b>

<b>(Trust the Piggy Banks)</b>

<b>The centers must distribute coins to the members.</b>

00:54:12.550 --> 00:54:14.250
<b>Then those members will enter the room...</b>

00:54:14.250 --> 00:54:16.233
<b>and put the coins in the piggy banks of their choice.</b>

00:54:17.019 --> 00:54:18.989
<b>- I need to trust the team members. - Seriously.</b>

00:54:18.989 --> 00:54:21.389
<b>Are you out if your name tag gets ripped off?</b>

00:54:21.389 --> 00:54:23.202
<b>- You keep playing. - I see.</b>

00:54:23.519 --> 00:54:25.289
<b>The center can also win coins...</b>

00:54:25.289 --> 00:54:27.682
<b>in the centers' room through a separate mission.</b>

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:30.199
<b>Okay. I got it.</b>

00:54:30.199 --> 00:54:32.052
<b>- Let's start the race. - Let's go.</b>

00:54:32.369 --> 00:54:33.753
<b>We need to win as a team.</b>

00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:36.570
<b>(Team Jee Seok Jin has 30 coins, Team Lee Kwang Soo has 43 coins.)</b>

00:54:36.570 --> 00:54:37.570
<b>I need to beat Kwang Soo.</b>

00:54:37.570 --> 00:54:39.253
<b>I think I am losing.</b>

00:54:40.039 --> 00:54:42.463
<b>- That's right. I am winning. - But I have Jae Seok and Jong Kook.</b>

00:54:42.639 --> 00:54:43.710
<b>They are good at...</b>

00:54:43.710 --> 00:54:44.809
<b>- Name Tag Elimination. - That's right.</b>

00:54:44.809 --> 00:54:46.093
<b>Once they bring me name tags...</b>

00:54:46.409 --> 00:54:49.280
<b>Should I put my interest first?</b>

00:54:49.280 --> 00:54:50.972
<b>Should I put the team's interest first?</b>

00:54:51.050 --> 00:54:52.420
<b>That's the question.</b>

00:54:52.420 --> 00:54:53.489
<b>(You can avoid the penalty if you have a lot of R coins.)</b>

00:54:53.489 --> 00:54:56.443
<b>Okay. In this round, I plan to put the team's interest first.</b>

00:54:56.860 --> 00:54:58.289
<b>I should focus on...</b>

00:54:58.289 --> 00:55:00.090
<b>finding the hidden name tags.</b>

00:55:00.090 --> 00:55:02.383
<b>Everyone on that team must be stronger than me.</b>

00:55:03.059 --> 00:55:05.552
<b>I will yank off the name tag of anyone I meet.</b>

00:55:06.230 --> 00:55:08.352
<b>So Min, Ji Hyo...</b>

00:55:09.940 --> 00:55:12.753
<b>I could find my teammates' name tags...</b>

00:55:13.409 --> 00:55:15.162
<b>and sell them for two coins each...</b>

00:55:15.179 --> 00:55:16.710
<b>- to the other team. - You could do that.</b>

00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:19.293
<b>(Betrayal is engraved on his DNA.)</b>

00:55:19.550 --> 00:55:21.463
<b>The race will start.</b>

00:55:21.679 --> 00:55:22.820
<b>Five,</b>

00:55:22.820 --> 00:55:24.003
<b>four,</b>

00:55:24.449 --> 00:55:25.532
<b>three,</b>

00:55:25.789 --> 00:55:27.032
<b>two,</b>

00:55:27.119 --> 00:55:28.218
<b>one.</b>

00:55:28.219 --> 00:55:29.619
<b>The race starts.</b>

00:55:29.619 --> 00:55:30.903
<b>Shall I go?</b>

00:55:31.260 --> 00:55:32.760
<b>(The race starts!)</b>

00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:34.383
<b>The race starts.</b>

00:55:34.530 --> 00:55:36.843
<b>- Did it start already? - It started.</b>

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:39.599
<b>The two of you will have a quiz.</b>

00:55:39.599 --> 00:55:40.630
<b>A quiz?</b>

00:55:40.630 --> 00:55:42.599
<b>- Listen to the question. - I think I have an advantage.</b>

00:55:42.599 --> 00:55:44.039
<b>You never know if I do this seriously.</b>

00:55:44.039 --> 00:55:46.809
<b>The center who answers the question correctly first...</b>

00:55:46.809 --> 00:55:50.710
<b>- will get 1 coin from the other. - 1 coin.</b>

00:55:50.710 --> 00:55:53.809
<b>The coins you get from the members as well as the quiz...</b>

00:55:53.809 --> 00:55:56.449
<b>need to go into the piggy banks.</b>

00:55:56.449 --> 00:55:59.090
<b>So I need to give them to my team members.</b>

00:55:59.090 --> 00:56:01.173
<b>I should save up the coins...</b>

00:56:01.219 --> 00:56:02.219
<b>and give them at once.</b>

00:56:02.219 --> 00:56:03.360
<b>Who do you trust the most?</b>

00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:05.159
<b>I trust Jong Kook the most.</b>

00:56:05.159 --> 00:56:07.558
<b>He doesn't lie to your face.</b>

00:56:07.559 --> 00:56:09.343
<b>I don't trust anyone but Seong Wu.</b>

00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:12.552
<b>Your team is the absolute worst.</b>

00:56:12.670 --> 00:56:14.900
<b>Here comes the first question.</b>

00:56:14.900 --> 00:56:18.253
<b>- Jae Seok has a son, right? - Yes.</b>

00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:21.409
<b>When is Yu Ji Ho's birthday?</b>

00:56:21.409 --> 00:56:23.662
<b>(When is Yu Ji Ho's birthday?)</b>

00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:25.992
<b>(What kind of a question is this?)</b>

00:56:26.150 --> 00:56:28.262
<b>(Flustered)</b>

00:56:28.550 --> 00:56:30.349
<b>Do you think we are Jae Seok's slaves?</b>

00:56:30.349 --> 00:56:31.449
<b>(The ridiculous question disheartens them.)</b>

00:56:31.449 --> 00:56:32.903
<b>This is driving me crazy.</b>

00:56:33.550 --> 00:56:35.802
<b>(Meanwhile, Jae Seok is looking for name tags.)</b>

00:56:37.489 --> 00:56:38.559
<b>(ZICO spots Jae Seok...)</b>

00:56:38.559 --> 00:56:39.659
<b>I spotted him.</b>

00:56:39.659 --> 00:56:41.182
<b>(and begins to chase after him.)</b>

00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:43.960
<b>(Jae Seok is unsuspecting.)</b>

00:56:43.960 --> 00:56:46.599
<b>- We need to find name tags. - I know.</b>

00:56:46.599 --> 00:56:48.969
<b>- Where can they hide... - ZICO is behind you.</b>

00:56:48.969 --> 00:56:51.253
<b>(He stops abruptly.)</b>

00:56:52.010 --> 00:56:54.070
<b>(He sees Jong Kook too late.)</b>

00:56:54.070 --> 00:56:56.023
<b>ZICO is behind you.</b>

00:56:56.409 --> 00:56:58.133
<b>(He's shocked.)</b>

00:56:58.579 --> 00:56:59.610
<b>- Wait for me. - Goodness.</b>

00:56:59.610 --> 00:57:01.380
<b>(The tables are turned.)</b>

00:57:01.380 --> 00:57:03.619
<b>- This is so scary. - Come here.</b>

00:57:03.619 --> 00:57:06.133
<b>- I'm so scared. - Come.</b>

00:57:06.889 --> 00:57:08.460
<b>What do I do?</b>

00:57:08.460 --> 00:57:10.343
<b>I'm sorry, ZICO.</b>

00:57:11.130 --> 00:57:12.159
<b>No.</b>

00:57:12.159 --> 00:57:13.960
<b>- Rip it off. - Don't.</b>

00:57:13.960 --> 00:57:16.400
<b>We started less than five minutes ago.</b>

00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:19.269
<b>You can't do this. You can't.</b>

00:57:19.269 --> 00:57:20.769
<b>He's so funny.</b>

00:57:20.769 --> 00:57:22.239
<b>- Don't. - Turn around.</b>

00:57:22.239 --> 00:57:23.822
<b>- Sorry. - No.</b>

00:57:25.170 --> 00:57:26.440
<b>He's so funny.</b>

00:57:26.440 --> 00:57:28.309
<b>He ran up from behind to rip off my name tag,</b>

00:57:28.309 --> 00:57:30.423
<b>and then he was petrified when he saw you.</b>

00:57:31.079 --> 00:57:32.710
<b>(He didn't see Jong Kook.)</b>

00:57:32.710 --> 00:57:34.480
<b>You had no idea ZICO was there.</b>

00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:37.989
<b>- I had no idea. - He came up so fast.</b>

00:57:37.989 --> 00:57:39.889
<b>You had no idea ZICO was there.</b>

00:57:39.889 --> 00:57:40.889
<b>(So Min takes the name tag and runs away.)</b>

00:57:40.889 --> 00:57:42.343
<b>It's my lucky day!</b>

00:57:42.690 --> 00:57:45.173
<b>I got lucky. Thanks, Jong Kook.</b>

00:57:45.659 --> 00:57:47.030
<b>I have to answer this before Jae Seok gets here.</b>

00:57:47.030 --> 00:57:48.559
<b>Let's go for it. Let me answer.</b>

00:57:48.559 --> 00:57:50.559
<b>- August 2... - I'm here.</b>

00:57:50.559 --> 00:57:52.070
<b>- You're here? - You're here already?</b>

00:57:52.070 --> 00:57:53.670
<b>(So Min arrives at the centers' room.)</b>

00:57:53.670 --> 00:57:55.253
<b>Hey.</b>

00:57:55.269 --> 00:57:56.300
<b>(Nice, So Min.)</b>

00:57:56.300 --> 00:57:57.468
<b>Good job.</b>

00:57:57.469 --> 00:58:00.869
<b>- Did you rip ZICO's name tag? - No, I was there at the right time.</b>

00:58:00.869 --> 00:58:02.063
<b>Anyhow,</b>

00:58:02.079 --> 00:58:03.239
<b>this is the first one.</b>

00:58:03.239 --> 00:58:06.250
<b>So Min, I'll give you coins for the name tag.</b>

00:58:06.250 --> 00:58:07.679
<b>- Thank you. How many are there? - Is it three?</b>

00:58:07.679 --> 00:58:10.249
<b>That's it? Only three?</b>

00:58:10.250 --> 00:58:12.690
<b>If we get Ji Ho's birthday right, we get one.</b>

00:58:12.690 --> 00:58:14.820
<b>If he doesn't get the question right, do we lose this?</b>

00:58:14.820 --> 00:58:15.989
<b>- No. - It's not like that.</b>

00:58:15.989 --> 00:58:18.059
<b>- We keep this. Wait. - Okay.</b>

00:58:18.059 --> 00:58:19.558
<b>Get back out there for now.</b>

00:58:19.559 --> 00:58:20.690
<b>- Do I leave? - Good job.</b>

00:58:20.690 --> 00:58:22.559
<b>No, I should put them away.</b>

00:58:22.559 --> 00:58:24.059
<b>No, we'll collect them first.</b>

00:58:24.059 --> 00:58:25.599
<b>- No. - No.</b>

00:58:25.599 --> 00:58:28.383
<b>10 seconds ago, he said he'll never give them to you.</b>

00:58:28.500 --> 00:58:29.900
<b>That's not true. Our team has to win.</b>

00:58:29.900 --> 00:58:31.710
<b>He doesn't trust you or Haha.</b>

00:58:31.710 --> 00:58:32.969
<b>- That's not true. - No.</b>

00:58:32.969 --> 00:58:34.780
<b>- Leave. Our team has to win. - I have to check.</b>

00:58:34.780 --> 00:58:36.309
<b>- It's for the team. - Keep playing.</b>

00:58:36.309 --> 00:58:39.579
<b>Let me answer. August 22.</b>

00:58:39.579 --> 00:58:40.963
<b>(August 22 is incorrect.)</b>

00:58:41.119 --> 00:58:42.550
<b>- How am I supposed to know? - What's the question?</b>

00:58:42.550 --> 00:58:43.662
<b>Let me answer.</b>

00:58:43.880 --> 00:58:45.050
<b>Kwang Soo.</b>

00:58:45.050 --> 00:58:46.250
<b>(When is Jae Seok's son's birthday?)</b>

00:58:46.250 --> 00:58:48.559
<b>October 28.</b>

00:58:48.559 --> 00:58:49.820
<b>(October 28 is incorrect.)</b>

<b>(Striking)</b>

00:58:51.829 --> 00:58:53.343
<b>(Striking)</b>

<b>You didn't hit me earlier.</b>

00:58:55.500 --> 00:58:56.613
<b>(My answer was incorrect.)</b>

00:58:57.429 --> 00:58:58.429
<b>(Ji Ho's birthday is the question?)</b>

00:58:58.429 --> 00:58:59.883
<b>You lost your chance.</b>

00:59:00.230 --> 00:59:01.653
<b>I'll help.</b>

00:59:02.139 --> 00:59:03.952
<b>It's May 1.</b>

00:59:04.940 --> 00:59:08.079
<b>I'm right. It was the password.</b>

00:59:08.079 --> 00:59:10.510
<b>- Let me answer. - Seok Jin.</b>

00:59:10.510 --> 00:59:12.432
<b>- May... - May?</b>

00:59:12.579 --> 00:59:13.579
<b>(May 1)</b>

<b>(May 1 is...)</b>

<b>(correct.)</b>

00:59:19.320 --> 00:59:20.432
<b>You're correct.</b>

00:59:21.289 --> 00:59:22.489
<b>(He picked up Haha's answer.)</b>

00:59:22.489 --> 00:59:24.789
<b>- Did he get it right? - He got this right?</b>

00:59:24.789 --> 00:59:25.829
<b>He did.</b>

00:59:25.829 --> 00:59:28.159
<b>Seok Jin, get a coin from Kwang Soo.</b>

00:59:28.159 --> 00:59:30.313
<b>- So I give it to you? - Yes.</b>

<b>- I'm going to collect them... - We have to win.</b>

00:59:32.369 --> 00:59:33.900
<b>- and go at once. - You have to get first place.</b>

00:59:33.900 --> 00:59:36.039
<b>Continue your activities. Why are you being lazy?</b>

00:59:36.039 --> 00:59:37.170
<b>Get the name tags.</b>

00:59:37.170 --> 00:59:40.139
<b>So I work like a dog and give him the coins?</b>

00:59:40.139 --> 00:59:41.940
<b>That's up to the centers.</b>

00:59:41.940 --> 00:59:43.992
<b>I'll keep you in mind.</b>

00:59:44.179 --> 00:59:47.133
<b>This isn't good. It's not worth working hard.</b>

00:59:47.679 --> 00:59:49.202
<b>This isn't looking good.</b>

00:59:49.679 --> 00:59:51.162
<b>What's my team doing?</b>

00:59:51.449 --> 00:59:53.872
<b>(ZICO is looking for another chance.)</b>

<b>That scared me. She's pink.</b>

00:59:57.760 --> 00:59:59.059
<b>That scared me.</b>

00:59:59.059 --> 01:00:00.872
<b>- Can I pass by? - Yes.</b>

01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:02.599
<b>- Come here. - Why?</b>

01:00:02.599 --> 01:00:04.570
<b>Come here. Hurry up, punk.</b>

01:00:04.570 --> 01:00:06.613
<b>- I can do one-on-one. - I don't think so.</b>

<b>(He checks that she's by herself.)</b>

<b>(He starts attacking.)</b>

01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:17.662
<b>(Why is he running away?)</b>

01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:20.063
<b>(It's Jong Kook again!)</b>

01:00:20.309 --> 01:00:21.420
<b>Get him.</b>

01:00:21.420 --> 01:00:23.420
<b>(Jong Kook was waiting for him to get close.)</b>

01:00:23.420 --> 01:00:25.190
<b>(He strikes when ZICO is in range.)</b>

01:00:25.190 --> 01:00:27.489
<b>Please, Jong Kook. Please.</b>

01:00:27.489 --> 01:00:29.820
<b>Please.</b>

01:00:29.820 --> 01:00:31.313
<b>(Ripping)</b>

01:00:31.789 --> 01:00:34.460
<b>Come on. What was that for?</b>

01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:36.329
<b>- Gosh, Jong Kook. - Do I take this?</b>

01:00:36.329 --> 01:00:38.383
<b>Okay. Sorry, ZICO.</b>

01:00:38.530 --> 01:00:39.653
<b>Hey.</b>

01:00:39.969 --> 01:00:41.983
<b>Serves you right, ZICO.</b>

01:00:42.869 --> 01:00:44.440
<b>(Jae Seok enters the centers' room.)</b>

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:45.940
<b>Hey. Okay.</b>

01:00:45.940 --> 01:00:47.269
<b>- No way. - Jae Seok.</b>

01:00:47.269 --> 01:00:49.222
<b>- Do you... - You have another one?</b>

01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:50.780
<b>How many times did ZICO get his name tag ripped?</b>

01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:51.880
<b>ZICO and Ji Hun.</b>

01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:53.079
<b>What's he doing?</b>

01:00:53.079 --> 01:00:54.602
<b>(What on earth are these two doing?)</b>

01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:56.963
<b>Why does ZICO keep getting eliminated?</b>

01:00:57.019 --> 01:00:59.288
<b>Give me some, and you can take this.</b>

01:00:59.289 --> 01:01:00.949
<b>- Sure, I'll do it. - Okay.</b>

01:01:00.949 --> 01:01:02.543
<b>- Alright. Okay. - Do it.</b>

01:01:02.559 --> 01:01:04.090
<b>Let's see.</b>

01:01:04.090 --> 01:01:07.159
<b>(2 for the captain and 1 for each of them)</b>

01:01:07.159 --> 01:01:08.530
<b>- Did you hear that? - I did.</b>

01:01:08.530 --> 01:01:10.512
<b>We almost caught up.</b>

01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:12.329
<b>What's my team doing?</b>

01:01:12.329 --> 01:01:13.583
<b>Jong Kook!</b>

01:01:13.929 --> 01:01:14.969
<b>- Let's work together. - Okay.</b>

01:01:14.969 --> 01:01:16.983
<b>Over there!</b>

01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:20.109
<b>(Jong Kook is bullying them.)</b>

01:01:20.110 --> 01:01:21.710
<b>Over there!</b>

01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:23.593
<b>(He falls like autumn leaves.)</b>

01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:25.150
<b>He's strong.</b>

01:01:25.150 --> 01:01:26.449
<b>- Don't come. - Get him.</b>

01:01:26.449 --> 01:01:28.579
<b>- Rip his name tag off. - Go.</b>

01:01:28.579 --> 01:01:30.980
<b>- Get his name tag. - Don't do it.</b>

01:01:30.980 --> 01:01:32.949
<b>- Sorry. - Rip off Seong Wu's name tag.</b>

01:01:32.949 --> 01:01:35.602
<b>- Get his name tag. - Please.</b>

01:01:35.619 --> 01:01:36.960
<b>We're sorry.</b>

01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:38.972
<b>- Sorry. - Wait.</b>

01:01:39.059 --> 01:01:41.030
<b>(He gets betrayed by his team and is eaten alive.)</b>

01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:42.313
<b>Sorry.</b>

01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:43.483
<b>What?</b>

01:01:43.699 --> 01:01:45.852
<b>- Come on. - Sorry.</b>

01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:48.383
<b>(ZICO is back!)</b>

01:01:49.039 --> 01:01:52.070
<b>(This is his third time trying.)</b>

01:01:52.070 --> 01:01:54.980
<b>(He grabbed the name tag first,)</b>

01:01:54.980 --> 01:01:58.949
<b>(but can he avoid Jong Kook?)</b>

01:01:58.949 --> 01:02:00.532
<b>Hey.</b>

01:02:00.679 --> 01:02:01.780
<b>Goodness.</b>

01:02:01.780 --> 01:02:04.363
<b>(Isn't this the same face as before?)</b>

01:02:05.690 --> 01:02:07.789
<b>(He tried to help.)</b>

01:02:07.789 --> 01:02:09.173
<b>(Ripping)</b>

01:02:09.789 --> 01:02:11.302
<b>(Who are you trying to help?)</b>

01:02:11.630 --> 01:02:14.242
<b>(He has to worry about himself.)</b>

01:02:14.559 --> 01:02:16.300
<b>- I got another one. - Okay.</b>

01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:17.613
<b>- ZICO! - What's this?</b>

01:02:18.469 --> 01:02:19.699
<b>He didn't even get one.</b>

01:02:19.699 --> 01:02:21.782
<b>Just hide!</b>

01:02:22.599 --> 01:02:24.269
<b>Why is my team not coming?</b>

01:02:24.269 --> 01:02:25.670
<b>- Hey. - Thank you, Seong Wu.</b>

01:02:25.670 --> 01:02:27.793
<b>- What's my team doing? - I know.</b>

01:02:28.309 --> 01:02:29.809
<b>(He's going around looking for name tags.)</b>

01:02:29.809 --> 01:02:31.293
<b>I'm first place.</b>

01:02:31.579 --> 01:02:32.980
<b>- Se Chan. - Jae Seok.</b>

<b>Where are you going?</b>

01:02:33.980 --> 01:02:35.302
<b>I'm running away.</b>

01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:37.932
<b>Do you think you can get my name tag?</b>

01:02:38.420 --> 01:02:40.190
<b>- Sorry? - If we wanted to.</b>

01:02:40.190 --> 01:02:42.460
<b>Why are you two going around together?</b>

01:02:42.460 --> 01:02:43.460
<b>(He's outnumbered and retreats.)</b>

01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:45.059
<b>You scared me, ZICO.</b>

01:02:45.059 --> 01:02:46.059
<b>(ZICO appears.)</b>

01:02:46.059 --> 01:02:48.130
<b>- Let's get to work. - Who are they? It's 2-on-2.</b>

01:02:48.130 --> 01:02:49.260
<b>It's 2-on-2.</b>

01:02:49.260 --> 01:02:51.530
<b>Let's see.</b>

01:02:51.530 --> 01:02:52.969
<b>- I can't do it. - Who is that?</b>

01:02:52.969 --> 01:02:54.769
<b>- Let's run away. - Let's go!</b>

01:02:54.769 --> 01:02:55.869
<b>- Help me, Jae Seok. - Hurry up.</b>

01:02:55.869 --> 01:02:57.699
<b>They'll get me for sure.</b>

01:02:57.699 --> 01:02:59.968
<b>ZICO, get So Min!</b>

01:02:59.969 --> 01:03:03.492
<b>So Min, hurry up.</b>

<b>Rip it, ZICO.</b>

01:03:22.460 --> 01:03:24.159

<b>There were three of you.</b>

01:03:43.579 --> 01:03:44.789
<b>Are you all right?</b>

01:03:44.789 --> 01:03:46.273

<b>I lost three times.</b>

01:03:56.030 --> 01:03:57.659
<b>Today's name tags were all yours.</b>

01:03:57.659 --> 01:03:58.670
<b>Pardon?</b>

01:03:58.670 --> 01:04:00.869
<b>It was all you. You need to rip off name tags.</b>

01:04:00.869 --> 01:04:02.822
<b>- I got two. - Okay!</b>

01:04:03.539 --> 01:04:04.539
<b>Good job!</b>

01:04:04.539 --> 01:04:05.769
<b>He has two of So Min.</b>

<b>This is going to be between ZICO and So Min.</b>

01:04:07.869 --> 01:04:09.392
<b>Okay, good job.</b>

<b>No, I give you whatever I want.</b>

<b>- Where? - Get one more. Hold on.</b>

<b>I lost three times. It's not good to send me out there.</b>

01:04:26.059 --> 01:04:27.559
<b>How many coins did you give up in the first game? Be honest.</b>

<b>- Pardon? - How many coins did you give?</b>

01:04:29.030 --> 01:04:30.360
<b>In the first game?</b>

<b>(and didn't submit any coins.)</b>

<b>If I tell the truth...</b>

<b>If you tell me the truth, I'll give some to you.</b>

<b>- Don't lose hope. - Promise me.</b>

01:05:00.429 --> 01:05:03.030
<b>Don't lose hope. I'll remember who got the most.</b>

01:05:03.030 --> 01:05:05.070
<b>- Let me vote. - Okay. Come back.</b>

01:05:05.070 --> 01:05:06.769
<b>Jong Kook is bringing a lot.</b>

<b>Se Chan, tell him you want some.</b>

<b>Before I let them take my name tag every 20 seconds.</b>

01:05:38.699 --> 01:05:40.929
<b>Give me five for now. Are you in or not?</b>

<b>- 3 and 2. - Fine.</b>

01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:55.802
<b>I don't remember seeing Se Chan's name tag.</b>

01:05:56.480 --> 01:05:58.633
<b>(He's finally in the piggy bank room.)</b>

01:05:59.050 --> 01:06:01.320
<b>- Ji Hyo is gone too. - Hey, Ji Hyo.</b>

01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:02.960
<b>(He doesn't do...)</b>

01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:05.673
<b>(as promised.)</b>

01:06:06.059 --> 01:06:07.460
<b>- Where is he? - What was that?</b>

01:06:07.460 --> 01:06:08.530
<b>- I'm done. - That didn't sound right.</b>

01:06:08.530 --> 01:06:10.659
<b>- Why? - Why was there a pause?</b>

01:06:10.659 --> 01:06:11.670
<b>No, it went...</b>

01:06:11.670 --> 01:06:13.670
<b>(He's making excuses.)</b>

01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:14.753
<b>then thud.</b>

01:06:14.769 --> 01:06:16.070
<b>(I don't trust him.)</b>

01:06:16.070 --> 01:06:17.483
<b>I'll get back.</b>

01:06:18.039 --> 01:06:19.892
<b>I need to see you, Seong Wu!</b>

01:06:21.639 --> 01:06:23.039
<b>Let's take each other's name tags.</b>

01:06:23.039 --> 01:06:24.322
<b>- Each other's? - Yes.</b>

01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:26.909
<b>(Haha tries to bargain.)</b>

01:06:26.909 --> 01:06:28.532
<b>Sure. Okay.</b>

01:06:28.619 --> 01:06:30.233
<b>(I like this guy.)</b>

01:06:30.250 --> 01:06:31.889
<b>Or should we rip our own and trade?</b>

01:06:31.889 --> 01:06:34.320
<b>- You love peace. - Right.</b>

01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:35.989
<b>Rip them off at the same time.</b>

01:06:35.989 --> 01:06:37.090
<b>- What? - At the same time.</b>

01:06:37.090 --> 01:06:39.313
<b>1, 2, 3.</b>

01:06:40.289 --> 01:06:41.429
<b>Rip it.</b>

01:06:41.429 --> 01:06:42.543
<b>(Glancing)</b>

01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:44.883
<b>(Ripping)</b>

01:06:47.070 --> 01:06:49.099
<b>(Haha puts his name tag back on.)</b>

01:06:49.099 --> 01:06:51.052
<b>I didn't rip it off.</b>

01:06:53.309 --> 01:06:55.363
<b>What is this?</b>

01:06:55.510 --> 01:06:57.980
<b>- What? - You ripped off your name tag.</b>

01:06:57.980 --> 01:06:59.110
<b>Give it to me.</b>

01:06:59.110 --> 01:07:00.633
<b>Rip off your name tag.</b>

01:07:01.510 --> 01:07:03.963
<b>I didn't know you would do it so fast.</b>

01:07:04.019 --> 01:07:05.219
<b>Give it to me.</b>

01:07:05.219 --> 01:07:06.833
<b>I am a busy man, Seong Wu.</b>

01:07:06.849 --> 01:07:09.289
<b>I am sorry, okay?</b>

01:07:09.289 --> 01:07:10.760
<b>- I will get going now. - Can't I rip off his name tag now?</b>

01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:11.960
<b>You can't do that when your name tag is ripped off.</b>

01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:13.872
<b>You are the man. Seriously.</b>

01:07:14.389 --> 01:07:15.659
<b>(Meanwhile, Jong Kook is looking for name tags.)</b>

01:07:15.659 --> 01:07:17.012
<b>Where could they be?</b>

01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:19.329
<b>(Trailing behind him...)</b>

01:07:19.329 --> 01:07:22.383
<b>(is Do Hyun.)</b>

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.409
<b>(He holds his breath...)</b>

01:07:25.409 --> 01:07:28.122
<b>(and chases after Jong Kook!)</b>

01:07:28.780 --> 01:07:30.010
<b>(Waiting for his chance)</b>

01:07:30.010 --> 01:07:32.079
<b>They used to hide name tags in here.</b>

01:07:32.079 --> 01:07:34.380
<b>(Jong Kook was looking for name tags...)</b>

01:07:34.380 --> 01:07:35.633
<b>My goodness.</b>

01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:38.602
<b>(when he spots Do Hyun.)</b>

01:07:38.820 --> 01:07:40.432
<b>I didn't expect you to look back.</b>

01:07:41.250 --> 01:07:43.142
<b>You should have walked over faster.</b>

01:07:43.659 --> 01:07:45.489
<b>You grew up watching Running Man, right?</b>

01:07:45.489 --> 01:07:46.773
<b>Of course.</b>

01:07:47.159 --> 01:07:48.742
<b>- You are the tiger. - Let me help you feel...</b>

01:07:49.159 --> 01:07:50.543
<b>what it's like.</b>

01:07:51.630 --> 01:07:53.512
<b>(Please spare me.)</b>

01:07:54.670 --> 01:07:56.269
<b>(It's a touch-and-go situation.)</b>

01:07:56.269 --> 01:07:57.952
<b>Jong Kook, please.</b>

01:07:58.239 --> 01:08:00.739
<b>(Despite his effort,)</b>

01:08:00.739 --> 01:08:03.739
<b>(the kid who grew up watching Running Man is outmatched.)</b>

01:08:03.739 --> 01:08:05.432
<b>You are too strong!</b>

01:08:05.780 --> 01:08:07.233
<b>(Jong Kook is relaxed.)</b>

01:08:08.519 --> 01:08:09.963
<b>(Ripping)</b>

01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:14.503
<b>(I didn't think Name Tag Elimination would end so quickly.)</b>

01:08:15.019 --> 01:08:17.289
<b>I wasn't going to rip off anyone's name tag.</b>

01:08:17.289 --> 01:08:19.142
<b>I was looking for the hidden ones. Why did you follow me?</b>

01:08:20.389 --> 01:08:22.530
<b>(After the storm,)</b>

01:08:22.530 --> 01:08:23.659
<b>Look at this.</b>

01:08:23.659 --> 01:08:24.800
<b>It broke.</b>

01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:26.630
<b>(only the traces of a ruthless fight remain.)</b>

01:08:26.630 --> 01:08:28.383
<b>Do Hyun, you got your name tag ripped off.</b>

01:08:29.539 --> 01:08:33.253
<b>You always participate in a race with someone like him.</b>

01:08:33.270 --> 01:08:34.822
<b>- Yes. - How do you do it?</b>

01:08:35.010 --> 01:08:37.622
<b>- They could be at the cafeteria. - There must be many here.</b>

01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:38.833
<b>Shall we go inside?</b>

01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:42.020
<b>- They could be here. - You are looking in there.</b>

01:08:42.020 --> 01:08:44.579
<b>(They flaunt their skills as the fruitless search continues.)</b>

01:08:44.579 --> 01:08:45.772
<b>Of course.</b>

01:08:46.119 --> 01:08:47.349
<b>You are incredible.</b>

01:08:47.350 --> 01:08:49.202
<b>I didn't think to look in there.</b>

01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:51.760
<b>They could be here.</b>

01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:53.213
<b>You didn't see this, did you?</b>

01:08:53.829 --> 01:08:56.683
<b>(There is an envelope containing a name tag.)</b>

01:08:58.260 --> 01:08:59.482
<b>This is a new pattern, right?</b>

01:08:59.770 --> 01:09:01.553
<b>- Whose... - Whose name tag is inside?</b>

01:09:02.170 --> 01:09:03.753
<b>Gosh, it's So Min's.</b>

01:09:04.869 --> 01:09:06.522
<b>It's So Min's.</b>

01:09:06.569 --> 01:09:07.640
<b>- Jae Seok. - Yes?</b>

01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:09.562
<b>- Give me So Min's name tag. - Why?</b>

01:09:10.810 --> 01:09:12.409
<b>- Why? - I want to sell it.</b>

01:09:12.409 --> 01:09:14.192
<b>(I want to sell it to the other team.)</b>

01:09:16.149 --> 01:09:17.149
<b>Come on.</b>

01:09:17.149 --> 01:09:18.933
<b>I am dying here.</b>

01:09:19.350 --> 01:09:21.090
<b>- You can't do that. - Why not?</b>

01:09:21.090 --> 01:09:23.173
<b>You can't sell your fellow team member's name tag!</b>

01:09:23.890 --> 01:09:24.989
<b>- Seriously. - Give it to me.</b>

01:09:24.989 --> 01:09:26.689
<b>I want to sell it for two coins.</b>

01:09:26.689 --> 01:09:27.929
<b>I don't have any coins.</b>

01:09:27.930 --> 01:09:29.083
<b>Give it to me.</b>

01:09:30.930 --> 01:09:32.199
<b>What are you doing? What is it?</b>

01:09:32.199 --> 01:09:33.383
<b>(So Min appears.)</b>

01:09:33.569 --> 01:09:35.100
<b>(Both of them are flustered.)</b>

01:09:35.100 --> 01:09:36.599
<b>- What is it? - It's nothing.</b>

01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:37.970
<b>- What were you doing? - What?</b>

01:09:37.970 --> 01:09:40.093
<b>What were you doing? What is that?</b>

01:09:40.439 --> 01:09:42.662
<b>- What is that? - Whose name tag is it?</b>

01:09:42.710 --> 01:09:43.810
<b>- Whose is it? - Whose is it?</b>

01:09:43.810 --> 01:09:46.750
<b>- I can't tell you. - Why not? We are on the same team.</b>

01:09:46.750 --> 01:09:48.079
<b>- It's yours, right? - No.</b>

01:09:48.079 --> 01:09:49.550
<b>- Whose is it? - Actually,</b>

01:09:49.550 --> 01:09:51.680
<b>it doesn't matter whether it belongs to someone on my team or me.</b>

01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:53.789
<b>- I used to think the same. - Hurry up and spill.</b>

01:09:53.789 --> 01:09:55.319
<b>But even a team member's name tag does matter.</b>

01:09:55.319 --> 01:09:57.442
<b>(I figured it out.)</b>

01:09:57.890 --> 01:09:59.159
<b>(Haha gave a new meaning to a fellow team member's name tag.)</b>

01:09:59.159 --> 01:10:00.872
<b>I used to think the same until a moment ago.</b>

01:10:01.260 --> 01:10:02.600
<b>- But... - What do you mean?</b>

01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:04.029
<b>even a fellow team member's name tag has its use.</b>

01:10:04.029 --> 01:10:05.630
<b>- Please explain. - It didn't occur to me at first.</b>

01:10:05.630 --> 01:10:06.970
<b>What do you mean? What use does it have?</b>

01:10:06.970 --> 01:10:08.170
<b>Whose is it? Give it to me.</b>

01:10:08.170 --> 01:10:10.322
<b>- I have everyone's. - Whose is it?</b>

01:10:10.770 --> 01:10:13.409
<b>(Whose name tag does she have?)</b>

01:10:13.409 --> 01:10:14.622
<b>- Tell us. - In that case,</b>

01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:16.039
<b>- give me mine. - Why?</b>

01:10:16.039 --> 01:10:17.223
<b>I will give you yours.</b>

01:10:19.180 --> 01:10:21.433
<b>- Is it Jae Seok's? - Yes. I have his.</b>

01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:22.963
<b>Give it to me.</b>

01:10:23.479 --> 01:10:25.603
<b>- Come on. Give it to me. - Give it to me.</b>

01:10:25.789 --> 01:10:28.433
<b>- I can't trust you. - You are holding it too tightly.</b>

01:10:28.460 --> 01:10:29.560
<b>Come here.</b>

01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:30.590
<b>I will pay a coin for it.</b>

01:10:30.590 --> 01:10:32.543
<b>(He wants to buy Jae Seok's name tag.)</b>

01:10:33.329 --> 01:10:34.859
<b>I will sell it to you for two coins.</b>

01:10:34.859 --> 01:10:36.482
<b>You are a swindler.</b>

01:10:36.699 --> 01:10:37.760
<b>- Hey! - Let me see it.</b>

01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:38.853
<b>(Jae Seok forces the trade.)</b>

01:10:39.130 --> 01:10:41.600
<b>(He opens So Min's envelope.)</b>

01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:42.939
<b>There is nothing inside!</b>

01:10:42.939 --> 01:10:44.883
<b>(Annoyed)</b>

01:10:46.069 --> 01:10:49.062
<b>(So Min is the queen of investment.)</b>

01:10:49.109 --> 01:10:50.779
<b>She is the absolute worst.</b>

01:10:50.779 --> 01:10:52.210
<b>I hate her.</b>

01:10:52.210 --> 01:10:54.010
<b>What is wrong with her?</b>

01:10:54.010 --> 01:10:55.079
<b>(Jae Seok, thank you for the trade.)</b>

01:10:55.079 --> 01:10:56.833
<b>She keeps getting worse.</b>

01:10:57.380 --> 01:10:59.803
<b>(After the trade...)</b>

01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:01.019
<b>Se Chan.</b>

01:11:01.020 --> 01:11:03.189
<b>I will sell 2 of my team's name tags for 3 coins.</b>

01:11:03.189 --> 01:11:04.760
<b>- My coins? Can we do that? - Yes.</b>

01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:06.060
<b>I don't need these name tags.</b>

01:11:06.060 --> 01:11:08.060
<b>- Hold on. Stay right there. - Come here.</b>

01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:10.612
<b>- Stay there. - I have four name tags in total.</b>

01:11:10.699 --> 01:11:13.029
<b>- Hold on. How... - I found them.</b>

01:11:13.029 --> 01:11:14.600
<b>- Did you find them? - How did you find so many?</b>

01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:17.000
<b>I can't do anything with them since they belong to my team,</b>

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:18.069
<b>so I want to sell them.</b>

01:11:18.069 --> 01:11:21.963
<b>I need coins because Seok Jin probably won't give me any.</b>

01:11:21.979 --> 01:11:23.923
<b>Thus, I want some coins for myself.</b>

01:11:24.340 --> 01:11:26.433
<b>- So this is a private business. - I am running a private business.</b>

01:11:27.149 --> 01:11:28.979
<b>3 coins for 2 name tags.</b>

<b>Five coins for these.</b>

01:11:30.050 --> 01:11:32.872
<b>- I have seven name tags. - In that case...</b>

01:11:32.949 --> 01:11:34.050
<b>I will pay three coins.</b>

01:11:34.050 --> 01:11:35.119
<b>I will sell these for five coins.</b>

01:11:35.119 --> 01:11:36.543
<b>- How many do you want to sell? - Three name tags.</b>

01:11:36.590 --> 01:11:37.659
<b>You said earlier that you would sell four name tags.</b>

01:11:37.659 --> 01:11:38.843
<b>There are some I can't sell.</b>

01:11:38.859 --> 01:11:39.890
<b>Listen.</b>

01:11:39.890 --> 01:11:41.560
<b>We can't buy from a private seller who changes her words.</b>

01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:43.500
<b>- Let's go. - I have three name tags to sell.</b>

01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:45.430
<b>- Let's go. - Buy two name tags.</b>

01:11:45.430 --> 01:11:47.199
<b>ZICO, buy two name tags.</b>

01:11:47.199 --> 01:11:48.640
<b>- Buy two name tags. - ZICO.</b>

01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:49.952
<b>This is how you do business.</b>

01:11:51.039 --> 01:11:53.322
<b>(This is how you do business.)</b>

01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:55.862
<b>They are so cheap.</b>

01:11:55.939 --> 01:11:57.439
<b>(She is tired from meeting annoying customers.)</b>

01:11:57.439 --> 01:11:58.633
<b>I would buy all of these name tags.</b>

01:11:59.079 --> 01:12:00.380
<b>I don't even know. I will get going.</b>

01:12:00.380 --> 01:12:02.380
<b>(It's another peace race on Running Man.)</b>

01:12:02.380 --> 01:12:04.020
<b>I should have gotten more coins.</b>

01:12:04.020 --> 01:12:05.673
<b>- I will give you the next question. - Okay.</b>

01:12:06.189 --> 01:12:08.350
<b>This one is about So Min.</b>

01:12:08.350 --> 01:12:09.760
<b>I don't know anything about So Min.</b>

01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:11.890
<b>On Running Man, So Min once said,</b>

01:12:11.890 --> 01:12:16.799
<b>"In high school, 'Blank' went into my clothes by accident."</b>

01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:18.500
<b>- Blank? - What goes in the blank?</b>

01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:20.069
<b>- It went into her clothes? - Yes.</b>

01:12:20.069 --> 01:12:21.412
<b>Let me answer! A flower.</b>

01:12:22.699 --> 01:12:23.822
<b>Is it incorrect?</b>

01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:25.909
<b>(Kwang Soo hits his head with the stick part.)</b>

01:12:25.909 --> 01:12:27.152
<b>Gosh, I am sorry.</b>

01:12:27.670 --> 01:12:29.238
<b>Gosh, I am sorry.</b>

01:12:29.239 --> 01:12:31.510
<b>- It was an accident. - What did you use to hit me?</b>

01:12:31.510 --> 01:12:33.833
<b>- It was an accident. - What did you use to hit me?</b>

01:12:34.109 --> 01:12:35.633
<b>It was an accident.</b>

01:12:35.979 --> 01:12:37.162
<b>Are you okay?</b>

01:12:37.449 --> 01:12:38.550
<b>It was an accident.</b>

01:12:38.550 --> 01:12:40.349
<b>- You were closer than I thought. - All right.</b>

01:12:40.350 --> 01:12:41.633
<b>I shouldn't have stretched my arm.</b>

01:12:41.789 --> 01:12:44.343
<b>- I shouldn't have stretched my arm. - All right.</b>

01:12:45.229 --> 01:12:46.612
<b>Let me answer. A petal.</b>

01:12:46.989 --> 01:12:48.960
<b>(Seok Jin's answer is incorrect.)</b>

01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:50.583
<b>(Aim well.)</b>

01:12:50.659 --> 01:12:51.843
<b>It's here.</b>

01:12:53.300 --> 01:12:56.353
<b>(What? Kwang Soo hits his head with the side this time.)</b>

01:12:57.069 --> 01:12:58.170
<b>(Seok Jin explodes.)</b>

01:12:58.170 --> 01:13:00.670
<b>What are you doing?</b>

01:13:00.670 --> 01:13:02.162
<b>I hit you properly this time.</b>

01:13:02.180 --> 01:13:03.963
<b>- It felt different, you jerk. - Why?</b>

01:13:04.180 --> 01:13:06.692
<b>(It's a strange toy hammer that hits with a thud.)</b>

01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:07.909
<b>What?</b>

01:13:07.909 --> 01:13:09.020
<b>I hit you properly this time.</b>

01:13:09.020 --> 01:13:10.819
<b>(While the two centers argue)</b>

01:13:10.819 --> 01:13:12.032
<b>Hold on.</b>

01:13:12.890 --> 01:13:14.619
<b>Did you put coins in the piggy banks?</b>

01:13:14.619 --> 01:13:16.090
<b>Did you put coins in the piggy banks?</b>

01:13:16.090 --> 01:13:17.543
<b>- No, I didn't. - You didn't?</b>

01:13:17.689 --> 01:13:18.729
<b>(This is strange.)</b>

01:13:18.729 --> 01:13:20.973
<b>ZICO, did you put coins in the piggy banks?</b>

01:13:21.090 --> 01:13:23.482
<b>Seong Wu, did you put coins in the piggy banks?</b>

01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:24.899
<b>I never went into that room.</b>

01:13:24.899 --> 01:13:26.329
<b>(No one has received coins from the center.)</b>

01:13:26.329 --> 01:13:27.853
<b>- I... - Everyone, gather around.</b>

01:13:27.930 --> 01:13:29.199
<b>Do Hyun.</b>

01:13:29.199 --> 01:13:31.282
<b>Do Hyun, did you put coins in the piggy banks?</b>

01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:33.723
<b>- He never gave me the coins. - No?</b>

01:13:33.909 --> 01:13:36.109
<b>- I never got any coins. - Listen, everyone.</b>

01:13:36.109 --> 01:13:37.510
<b>You have the right to go in there.</b>

01:13:37.510 --> 01:13:38.710
<b>(You have the right to go into the piggy bank room.)</b>

01:13:38.710 --> 01:13:39.880
<b>- What would we do in there? - We don't have coins.</b>

01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:41.479
<b>Kwang Soo has the coins.</b>

01:13:41.479 --> 01:13:42.720
<b>(The coins the naive members collected...)</b>

01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:45.633
<b>(are in the greedy center's hands.)</b>

01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:47.689
<b>Hold on. We need to make a complaint.</b>

01:13:47.689 --> 01:13:49.003
<b>Come here. Gather around.</b>

01:13:49.220 --> 01:13:50.420
<b>- Kwang Soo. - Yes?</b>

01:13:50.420 --> 01:13:52.643
<b>Why didn't you give a single coin to the members?</b>

01:13:52.789 --> 01:13:54.729
<b>- What? - Everyone is dissatisfied.</b>

01:13:54.729 --> 01:13:56.600
<b>- Go! Go and work! - Come here.</b>

01:13:56.600 --> 01:13:58.029
<b>- Go and wok! - Come here.</b>

01:13:58.029 --> 01:13:59.869
<b>- You did nothing. - Why didn't you give a single coin?</b>

01:13:59.869 --> 01:14:01.569
<b>- What are you doing? - I am...</b>

01:14:01.569 --> 01:14:02.600
<b>You instigated them.</b>

01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:03.600
<b>I am their representative.</b>

01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:04.923
<b>Why didn't you give a single coin to the members?</b>

01:14:04.939 --> 01:14:07.239
<b>Hard work pays off, okay?</b>

01:14:07.239 --> 01:14:09.710
<b>It's not like I will take all the coins.</b>

01:14:09.710 --> 01:14:11.109
<b>Shouldn't we get the coins...</b>

01:14:11.109 --> 01:14:12.779
<b>- once we give you the name tags? - That's right.</b>

01:14:12.779 --> 01:14:14.433
<b>- Listen. - Hey, don't be like that.</b>

01:14:14.850 --> 01:14:16.779
<b>- Give us two coins each. - I will give them to whom I trust.</b>

01:14:16.779 --> 01:14:18.250
<b>- That's the captain's duty. - That's right.</b>

01:14:18.250 --> 01:14:19.720
<b>- Give us two coins each. - Let me ask you this.</b>

01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:21.003
<b>Who is your captain?</b>

01:14:21.850 --> 01:14:23.060
<b>Then why are you listening to him?</b>

01:14:23.060 --> 01:14:24.760
<b>We will put some coins in your piggy bank too.</b>

01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:26.260
<b>Be fair. We will put some coins in your piggy bank too.</b>

01:14:26.260 --> 01:14:27.513
<b>Stand up straight.</b>

01:14:27.989 --> 01:14:30.112
<b>- Guys, this is... - You jerks!</b>

01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:33.470
<b>(How dare you talk back to the center?)</b>

01:14:33.470 --> 01:14:34.652
<b>Go and work!</b>

01:14:35.439 --> 01:14:36.622
<b>Go and work!</b>

01:14:37.270 --> 01:14:39.152
<b>Do you think I am lazing around? Go and work!</b>

01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:41.640
<b>- Don't let him sway you. - Use this time to get...</b>

01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:43.239
<b>as many name tags as possible.</b>

01:14:43.239 --> 01:14:45.893
<b>If I were you, I would give away my name tag to sabotage him.</b>

01:14:45.909 --> 01:14:47.149
<b>- Hey. - I didn't think about this.</b>

01:14:47.149 --> 01:14:48.692
<b>Why are you ganging up on me?</b>

01:14:49.220 --> 01:14:50.979
<b>(The group action makes Kwang Soo anxious.)</b>

01:14:50.979 --> 01:14:52.789
<b>- I will distribute them as I want. - Okay.</b>

01:14:52.789 --> 01:14:54.032
<b>I will distribute them as I want.</b>

01:14:54.289 --> 01:14:56.272
<b>Close your eyes.</b>

01:14:57.119 --> 01:14:59.259
<b>- Close your eyes. - We worked hard!</b>

01:14:59.260 --> 01:15:01.213
<b>Close your eyes.</b>

01:15:01.260 --> 01:15:03.100
<b>I will distribute the coins.</b>

01:15:03.100 --> 01:15:04.300
<b>(They close their eyes willingly because they are nice.)</b>

01:15:04.300 --> 01:15:06.029
<b>I see someone who didn't close his eyes.</b>

01:15:06.029 --> 01:15:07.912
<b>Do Hyun didn't close his eyes. Oh, I am wrong.</b>

01:15:09.439 --> 01:15:10.539
<b>Close your eyes.</b>

01:15:10.539 --> 01:15:12.122
<b>(He gives 3 coins to Seong Wu.)</b>

01:15:13.270 --> 01:15:14.310
<b>(Is he taking them back?)</b>

01:15:14.310 --> 01:15:15.423
<b>Hold on.</b>

01:15:15.510 --> 01:15:17.162
<b>Let go. Let go if you want your fingers intact.</b>

01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:21.079
<b>(Flustered)</b>

01:15:21.079 --> 01:15:23.232
<b>- Did you pass by me already? - I will give you some.</b>

01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:24.902
<b>Hide your coins.</b>

01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:26.133
<b>Hide your coins.</b>

01:15:26.420 --> 01:15:27.902
<b>Hide your coins. Don't show each other.</b>

01:15:29.420 --> 01:15:30.742
<b>I distributed all the coins.</b>

01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:32.130
<b>- We only got a few. - I distributed all the coins.</b>

01:15:32.130 --> 01:15:33.289
<b>I worked so hard.</b>

01:15:33.289 --> 01:15:34.812
<b>I distributed all the coins. I don't have any coins left.</b>

01:15:35.029 --> 01:15:36.260
<b>- You don't have any coins left? - No.</b>

01:15:36.260 --> 01:15:37.800
<b>- Are you certain? - Yes. I distributed all the coins.</b>

01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:39.482
<b>Okay. Kwang Soo,</b>

01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:41.183
<b>can I check your back pockets?</b>

01:15:41.729 --> 01:15:42.883
<b>You jerk.</b>

01:15:43.100 --> 01:15:44.223
<b>What?</b>

01:15:44.300 --> 01:15:46.293
<b>- This is unfair. - The only thing I have is a phone.</b>

01:15:48.069 --> 01:15:51.122
<b>(When he takes out his phone, they hear the sound of coins.)</b>

01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:53.449
<b>(Hold on.)</b>

01:15:53.449 --> 01:15:55.433
<b>- Hold on. - What was that sound?</b>

01:15:55.850 --> 01:15:57.902
<b>Okay. You guys passed the test.</b>

01:15:59.020 --> 01:16:01.619
<b>(Everyone passed the observation test.)</b>

01:16:01.619 --> 01:16:02.843
<b>- Kwang Soo. - Okay.</b>

01:16:02.859 --> 01:16:04.603
<b>- That's a lot! - I will give them to you.</b>

01:16:04.890 --> 01:16:06.028
<b>I will give them to you.</b>

01:16:06.029 --> 01:16:08.029
<b>There is no one I can trust, okay?</b>

01:16:08.029 --> 01:16:09.883
<b>- This is too much. - Listen.</b>

01:16:10.029 --> 01:16:11.942
<b>The member who paid one coin earlier,</b>

01:16:13.130 --> 01:16:14.383
<b>Seong Wu, will get five coins.</b>

01:16:14.470 --> 01:16:16.053
<b>- What? - You will get five coins.</b>

01:16:16.239 --> 01:16:17.500
<b>This is nothing to be happy about.</b>

01:16:17.500 --> 01:16:18.753
<b>Put one coin in your piggy bank.</b>

01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:20.039
<b>- Okay. - Put one coin in your piggy bank.</b>

01:16:20.039 --> 01:16:22.209
<b>- The rest... - I paid one coin earlier too.</b>

01:16:22.210 --> 01:16:24.409
<b>- Did you pay one coin, ZICO? - This is too much.</b>

01:16:24.409 --> 01:16:25.633
<b>ZICO, leave the room.</b>

01:16:25.779 --> 01:16:27.449
<b>Go. Go and work!</b>

01:16:27.449 --> 01:16:28.479
<b>(ZICO goes back to work.)</b>

01:16:28.479 --> 01:16:29.520
<b>- I will give you one. - Thank you.</b>

01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:30.920
<b>- Put them in my piggy bank. - I will do that.</b>

01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:32.572
<b>If our team loses,</b>

01:16:32.750 --> 01:16:34.303
<b>- we will get the penalty. - Okay.</b>

01:16:34.390 --> 01:16:36.390
<b>Look at the forest, not the trees.</b>

01:16:36.390 --> 01:16:37.590
<b>It's the team that matters.</b>

01:16:37.590 --> 01:16:39.973
<b>(The center's favorite member, Seong Wu enters.)</b>

01:16:41.390 --> 01:16:44.630
<b>(He puts one coin in his piggy bank.)</b>

01:16:44.630 --> 01:16:46.129
<b>(Then he adds another one.)</b>

01:16:46.130 --> 01:16:49.053
<b>(He has a conscience, so he gives one to Kwang Soo.)</b>

01:16:49.239 --> 01:16:50.770
<b>(Seong Wu deviates a little,)</b>

01:16:50.770 --> 01:16:52.322
<b>(and Ji Hun is next.)</b>

01:16:53.140 --> 01:16:56.492
<b>(He embezzles without hesitating.)</b>

01:16:57.210 --> 01:16:59.263
<b>(Like center, like teammate.)</b>

01:16:59.579 --> 01:17:02.732
<b>(Do Hyun and Se Chan were discontent. They deposit the coins.)</b>

01:17:03.850 --> 01:17:05.279
<b>Five minutes left.</b>

01:17:05.279 --> 01:17:07.032
<b>You have to hurry!</b>

01:17:07.189 --> 01:17:09.503
<b>Rip off name tags like crazy. We're losing right now.</b>

01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:12.043
<b>- Hurry. Anybody! - Hurry up.</b>

01:17:12.060 --> 01:17:13.090
<b>Should I go now?</b>

01:17:13.090 --> 01:17:14.090
<b>(ZICO was abandoned by Kwang Soo,)</b>

01:17:14.090 --> 01:17:15.390
<b>(but he shows his loyalty near the end.)</b>

01:17:15.390 --> 01:17:17.229
<b>- They're not my team. - Okay!</b>

01:17:17.229 --> 01:17:18.600
<b>- Four dollars. - Hurry!</b>

01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:21.353
<b>(He flung ZICO earlier, but he loves him now.)</b>

<b>We're behind by 12 to 13.</b>

<b>Your team has enough. Give it to yourself.</b>

01:17:29.810 --> 01:17:31.140
<b>Race is over.</b>

<b>This is the last chance.</b>

01:17:33.380 --> 01:17:34.793
<b>(Race is over, and this is the last chance to deposit coins.)</b>

01:17:35.279 --> 01:17:36.819
<b>(Did Kwang Soo and the team see the forest or the trees?)</b>

01:17:36.819 --> 01:17:39.189
<b>- I think we won. - You guys already won.</b>

01:17:39.189 --> 01:17:40.633
<b>Race is over.</b>

01:17:41.020 --> 01:17:43.460
<b>We're counting the coins right now.</b>

01:17:43.460 --> 01:17:45.489
<b>As I said before, we'll compare which captain has more coins,</b>

01:17:45.489 --> 01:17:47.130
<b>and the team with that captain wins.</b>

01:17:47.130 --> 01:17:48.590
<b>1st and 2nd place on the winning team will win prizes,</b>

01:17:48.590 --> 01:17:50.500
<b>and the last two on the losing team will face the penalty.</b>

01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:52.869
<b>I heard something shocking from that team,</b>

01:17:52.869 --> 01:17:53.899
<b>but I hope it's not true.</b>

01:17:53.899 --> 01:17:56.053
<b>Somebody sold their name tag.</b>

01:17:56.640 --> 01:17:58.239
<b>- No way. - Somebody gave 2 to 3 coins...</b>

01:17:58.239 --> 01:17:59.909
<b>per name tag.</b>

01:17:59.909 --> 01:18:01.969
<b>- I hope it's not true. - This is the funny part.</b>

01:18:01.970 --> 01:18:03.109
<b>They sold other people's name tags for cheap...</b>

01:18:03.109 --> 01:18:05.022
<b>and sold their own at a higher price.</b>

01:18:05.180 --> 01:18:07.180
<b>Other people for cheap, and theirs at a higher price.</b>

01:18:07.180 --> 01:18:10.433
<b>I heard my name tag got sold for a coin.</b>

01:18:10.479 --> 01:18:13.119
<b>My team fell apart.</b>

01:18:13.119 --> 01:18:15.433
<b>There was no other way. I didn't want to lose.</b>

01:18:16.390 --> 01:18:18.560
<b>- Seok Jin, look at yours first. - Okay, I will.</b>

01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:19.689
<b>This.</b>

01:18:19.689 --> 01:18:20.859
<b>It looks heavy.</b>

01:18:20.859 --> 01:18:23.899
<b>- You probably have a lot. - I know, I gave him a lot.</b>

01:18:23.899 --> 01:18:25.500
<b>I gave him everything.</b>

01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:27.170
<b>- Stop lying. - I gave him a lot.</b>

01:18:27.170 --> 01:18:28.270
<b>That's a lot.</b>

01:18:28.270 --> 01:18:30.100
<b>Haha is lying 100 percent.</b>

01:18:30.100 --> 01:18:31.869
<b>Seok Jin got...</b>

<b>43 coins.</b>

01:18:33.109 --> 01:18:34.322
<b>(Seok Jin's piggy bank had 43 coins.)</b>

01:18:34.409 --> 01:18:35.609
<b>43 in this?</b>

01:18:35.609 --> 01:18:36.880
<b>That's a lot.</b>

01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:38.140
<b>- I gave you all of them. - I gave you them all.</b>

01:18:38.140 --> 01:18:39.680
<b>Really? You gave me a lot.</b>

01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:41.162
<b>(Kwang Soo opens his piggy bank.)</b>

01:18:42.279 --> 01:18:43.562
<b>We should have more.</b>

01:18:43.779 --> 01:18:44.880
<b>His...</b>

<b>I don't hear anything.</b>

01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:48.550
<b>Maybe we won.</b>

01:18:48.550 --> 01:18:50.159
<b>- We won. - I think we won.</b>

01:18:50.159 --> 01:18:51.303
<b>Wait.</b>

01:18:52.060 --> 01:18:53.989
<b>This can't be. My gosh.</b>

01:18:53.989 --> 01:18:55.430
<b>- Was that it? - Wait.</b>

01:18:55.430 --> 01:18:57.060
<b>- See? - We won.</b>

01:18:57.060 --> 01:18:58.500
<b>- We're family. - Wait.</b>

01:18:58.500 --> 01:18:59.800
<b>That was everything.</b>

01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:01.099
<b>- Goodness. - This is unbelievable.</b>

01:19:01.100 --> 01:19:02.782
<b>These people.</b>

01:19:03.170 --> 01:19:04.840
<b>(Team Kwang Soo acted collectively.)</b>

01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:06.669
<b>- Let me tell you. - These people.</b>

01:19:06.670 --> 01:19:08.340
<b>Kwang Soo's piggy bank...</b>

01:19:08.340 --> 01:19:09.710
<b>- had 16 coins. - What?</b>

01:19:09.710 --> 01:19:12.210
<b>(Only 16?)</b>

01:19:12.210 --> 01:19:14.192
<b>- What? - Overall,</b>

01:19:14.409 --> 01:19:16.532
<b>Seok Jin had 70,</b>

01:19:17.949 --> 01:19:20.619
<b>(Kwang Soo was ahead by 13.)</b>

01:19:20.619 --> 01:19:22.359
<b>and Kwang Soo had 56.</b>

01:19:22.359 --> 01:19:24.303
<b>(With only 56, Team Kwang Soo loses.)</b>

01:19:24.420 --> 01:19:26.630
<b>(Team Seok Jin wins.)</b>

01:19:26.630 --> 01:19:28.430
<b>- This is family. - This is unbelievable.</b>

01:19:28.430 --> 01:19:30.013
<b>- This is family. - Team Seok Jin wins.</b>

01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:31.859
<b>This is amazing.</b>

01:19:31.859 --> 01:19:34.199
<b>You guys! I told you.</b>

01:19:34.199 --> 01:19:35.470
<b>Really?</b>

01:19:35.470 --> 01:19:36.470
<b>No, look.</b>

01:19:36.470 --> 01:19:38.170
<b>I got seven, and I gave you everything.</b>

01:19:38.170 --> 01:19:39.539
<b>I didn't get too many.</b>

01:19:39.539 --> 01:19:40.909
<b>They took the coins for themselves.</b>

01:19:40.909 --> 01:19:43.022
<b>This is so unfair.</b>

01:19:43.079 --> 01:19:45.279
<b>1st and 2nd place are as follows.</b>

01:19:45.279 --> 01:19:46.850
<b>So Min came in first place.</b>

01:19:46.850 --> 01:19:49.303
<b>(So Min places first.)</b>

01:19:50.850 --> 01:19:52.489
<b>I came in first?</b>

01:19:52.489 --> 01:19:54.250
<b>- What did you do? - I came in first?</b>

01:19:54.250 --> 01:19:56.043
<b>Yes. I'm in first place?</b>

01:19:56.189 --> 01:19:57.902
<b>The individual businesswoman won.</b>

01:19:57.960 --> 01:19:59.260
<b>She got a couple from us.</b>

01:19:59.260 --> 01:20:00.659
<b>(She collected small sums and created a miracle.)</b>

01:20:00.659 --> 01:20:02.899
<b>She got none in here, and she won?</b>

01:20:02.899 --> 01:20:05.159
<b>Jae Seok and Jong Kook come in second.</b>

<b>(Are we 2nd place?)</b>

01:20:06.369 --> 01:20:08.800
<b>Jong Kook!</b>

01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:09.869
<b>(Seok Jin, So Min, Jong Kook, and Jae Seok win prizes.)</b>

01:20:09.869 --> 01:20:11.753
<b>Kwang Soo, open each one.</b>

01:20:11.800 --> 01:20:14.893
<b>I don't know anymore.</b>

01:20:15.010 --> 01:20:16.562
<b>I won't let this go.</b>

01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:19.062
<b>I'm looking forward to this.</b>

01:20:19.079 --> 01:20:20.350
<b>Ji Hun first.</b>

<b>I'm not really suspicious.</b>

01:20:23.250 --> 01:20:24.702
<b>Like this? Okay.</b>

01:20:24.819 --> 01:20:26.473
<b>- Is there a lot? - Is there a good amount?</b>

01:20:26.819 --> 01:20:28.319
<b>It looks kind of heavy.</b>

01:20:28.319 --> 01:20:30.673
<b>(Spilling)</b>

01:20:31.659 --> 01:20:32.829
<b>(He's shocked.)</b>

01:20:32.829 --> 01:20:35.430
<b>- How many? - Ji Hun deposited 14 coins.</b>

01:20:35.430 --> 01:20:37.183
<b>He took all for himself.</b>

01:20:37.699 --> 01:20:38.829
<b>Did you not give me any?</b>

01:20:38.829 --> 01:20:40.282
<b>I gave you one.</b>

01:20:40.729 --> 01:20:42.083
<b>- You gave me one? - Yes.</b>

01:20:42.100 --> 01:20:43.399
<b>Kwang Soo.</b>

01:20:43.399 --> 01:20:44.670
<b>(Do Hyun's piggy bank is next.)</b>

01:20:44.670 --> 01:20:46.439
<b>Do Hyun is convincing.</b>

01:20:46.439 --> 01:20:48.069
<b>(There's also a lot.)</b>

01:20:48.069 --> 01:20:49.880
<b>Do Hyun took 10.</b>

<b>- 10? - This is funny.</b>

01:20:51.739 --> 01:20:53.649
<b>This team is so funny.</b>

<b>They're all like Kwang Soo.</b>

<b>- Se Chan. - I don't have too many.</b>

<b>(As expected)</b>

01:20:58.380 --> 01:21:00.220
<b>12 for Se Chan.</b>

01:21:00.220 --> 01:21:02.333
<b>- 12? That was less than I thought. - Yes, 12.</b>

01:21:02.920 --> 01:21:04.090
<b>(He accidentally spoke what was on his mind.)</b>

01:21:04.090 --> 01:21:05.202
<b>Really?</b>

01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:06.989
<b>That was less than I thought.</b>

01:21:06.989 --> 01:21:08.729
<b>He even caused a revolt.</b>

01:21:08.729 --> 01:21:09.843
<b>How many?</b>

01:21:09.859 --> 01:21:11.260
<b>- He has a lot. - Seong Wu...</b>

01:21:11.260 --> 01:21:12.600
<b>- had seven. - That's less than I thought.</b>

01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:13.970
<b>- Really? - Seven? Wait.</b>

01:21:13.970 --> 01:21:15.452
<b>- What happens then? - That wasn't what he expected.</b>

01:21:15.630 --> 01:21:17.270
<b>ZICO doesn't have much.</b>

01:21:17.270 --> 01:21:18.522
<b>(ZICO seemed the most sneaky on Team Kwang Soo,)</b>

01:21:19.069 --> 01:21:20.109
<b>ZICO had two.</b>

<b>Last place is Do Hyun,</b>

<b>Hold him so that he doesn't fall backward.</b>

01:21:52.810 --> 01:21:54.539
<b>- How intense is it? - It's good.</b>

01:21:54.539 --> 01:21:56.079
<b>No, it's not too bad.</b>

01:21:56.079 --> 01:21:57.293

<b>He absorbed the force.</b>

01:22:21.100 --> 01:22:22.553
<b>You know the lucky draw, right?</b>

01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:24.840
<b>Please go in whatever order you decide.</b>

01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:17.673
<b>- Why was this here? - He added it at the end.</b>

01:23:17.689 --> 01:23:19.260
<b>- This. - My gosh.</b>

01:23:19.260 --> 01:23:20.430
<b>(Please take good care of it.)</b>

01:23:20.430 --> 01:23:21.829
<b>You must take it.</b>

01:23:21.829 --> 01:23:23.883
<b>So Min.</b>

01:23:24.659 --> 01:23:25.782
<b>So Min.</b>

01:23:26.100 --> 01:23:27.213
<b>What number is it?</b>

01:23:27.430 --> 01:23:28.430
<b>Eight.</b>

01:23:28.430 --> 01:23:31.300
<b>(She wins autographed name tags of the members.)</b>

01:23:31.300 --> 01:23:32.822
<b>- Autographed name tags. - Oh, dear.</b>

01:23:33.039 --> 01:23:34.770
<b>I don't want it.</b>

01:23:34.770 --> 01:23:36.992
<b>So Min, sell them.</b>

01:23:37.609 --> 01:23:38.680
<b>I'll buy.</b>

01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:40.179
<b>Sell them.</b>

01:23:40.180 --> 01:23:42.309
<b>- It's on her back. - Let's see.</b>

01:23:42.310 --> 01:23:43.520
<b>She'll fly away.</b>

01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:44.879
<b>She's rich.</b>

01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:46.119
<b>I don't think...</b>

01:23:46.119 --> 01:23:48.420
<b>It's nothing again.</b>

01:23:48.420 --> 01:23:50.460
<b>47. It's a dud.</b>

01:23:50.460 --> 01:23:51.789
<b>That's better than mine.</b>

01:23:51.789 --> 01:23:53.760
<b>Why? We should congratulate you.</b>

01:23:53.760 --> 01:23:56.083
<b>Why would you congratulate me? Where am I supposed to put this?</b>

01:23:56.100 --> 01:23:57.343
<b>I want the set.</b>

01:23:57.529 --> 01:23:59.399
<b>(Center Seok Jin picks last.)</b>

01:23:59.399 --> 01:24:00.583
<b>He picked.</b>

01:24:01.329 --> 01:24:03.100
<b>(What is it?)</b>

01:24:03.100 --> 01:24:04.640
<b>1, 2, 3.</b>

01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:06.840
<b>2... 21.</b>

01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:08.122
<b>(21!)</b>

01:24:08.840 --> 01:24:10.039
<b>Air fryer.</b>

01:24:10.039 --> 01:24:11.909
<b>(He wins an air fryer.)</b>

01:24:11.909 --> 01:24:13.350
<b>That's awesome.</b>

01:24:13.350 --> 01:24:15.079
<b>This is the most economical.</b>

01:24:15.079 --> 01:24:16.680
<b>You have an air fryer at home.</b>

01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:18.433
<b>I do, but I had it for over 10 years.</b>

01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:20.673
<b>- Air fryers came out 10 years ago? - Of course.</b>

01:24:21.220 --> 01:24:22.532
<b>- Really? - Be quiet.</b>

01:24:22.550 --> 01:24:25.119
<b>I don't think they've been around for 10 years.</b>

01:24:25.119 --> 01:24:27.090
<b>- Maybe 7 or 8 years. - Okay.</b>

01:24:27.090 --> 01:24:28.760
<b>Air fryer!</b>

01:24:28.760 --> 01:24:30.060
<b>(Seok Jin takes the air fryer!)</b>

01:24:30.060 --> 01:24:31.329
<b>Good work.</b>

01:24:31.329 --> 01:24:33.569
<b>(We would like to thank ZICO, Seong Wu,)</b>

01:24:33.569 --> 01:24:35.612
<b>(Do Hyun, and Ji Hun for a great time.)</b>

01:24:36.770 --> 01:24:39.282
<b>(With familiar faces Hong Hyun Hee and Kim Ji Min)</b>

01:24:39.939 --> 01:24:42.353
<b>(It's a lively atmosphere like a team dinner.)</b>

01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:45.522
<b>(But something's strange.)</b>

01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:47.750
<b>(There are way too many cameras,)</b>

01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:49.949
<b>(and people start disappearing one at a time.)</b>

01:24:49.949 --> 01:24:51.449
<b>(Will they go through the door...)</b>

01:24:51.449 --> 01:24:52.689
<b>(or will there be resistance?)</b>

01:24:52.689 --> 01:24:55.003
<b>(Nobody knows what the consequences are.)</b>

01:24:55.960 --> 01:24:58.488
<b>(Will they take the R coins or leave it alone?)</b>

01:24:58.489 --> 01:25:00.812
<b>(They have many options.)</b>

01:25:00.989 --> 01:25:03.060
<b>(Will they win or lose?)</b>

01:25:03.060 --> 01:25:04.559
<b>(You have to act when nobody's looking.)</b>

01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:06.982
<b>(The mystery stimulates their curiosity.)</b>

01:25:07.329 --> 01:25:10.452
<b>(This intense race has no answer. How will it end?)</b>

01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:12.423
<b>(Race Nobody Can Tell: Hey, You Can Find Out Too!)</b>
