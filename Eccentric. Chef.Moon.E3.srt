<b>There has been a misunderstanding.</b>

<b>I was meaning to tell you

<b>[I am sincerely sorry for your loss.]</b>

<b>[Yes.]</b>

<b>My parents are the ones who can allow you

<b>It's not something

<b>I have no idea how the court allowed you

<b>[So, is this how you're going to be?]</b>

773
00:56:58,616 --> 00:57:01,916
<b>Your left shoulder is sagging.
Is your posture bad?</b>

774
00:57:02,416 --> 00:57:04,556
<b>Look! Bowlegs!</b>

775
00:57:04,956 --> 00:57:07,126
<b>Tighten your abs and your butt!</b>

776
00:57:10,126 --> 00:57:12,826
<b>A little better. I'm leaving now.</b>

777
00:57:13,226 --> 00:57:14,236
<b>Thank...</b>

778
00:57:18,566 --> 00:57:19,966
<b>What is wrong with me?</b>

779
00:57:20,306 --> 00:57:21,336
<b>[Seoha Rice Mill]</b>

780
00:57:29,746 --> 00:57:30,916
<b>Nice one!</b>

781
00:57:41,726 --> 00:57:43,526
<b>-Hey!
-Why?</b>

782
00:57:43,796 --> 00:57:45,326
<b>Someone scratched Mr. Jin's car.</b>

783
00:57:46,966 --> 00:57:49,136
<b>He's going to yell at us.</b>

784
00:57:49,566 --> 00:57:52,736
<b>I told you to park properly!</b>

785
00:57:53,106 --> 00:57:54,106
<b>Sorry, sir.</b>

786
00:57:57,206 --> 00:57:58,146
<b>This car did it.</b>

787
00:57:58,206 --> 00:57:59,776
<b>-Which one?
-Here.</b>

788
00:58:04,646 --> 00:58:06,886
<b>Darn it.
How am I supposed to find this punk?</b>

789
00:58:10,286 --> 00:58:11,956
<b>Can you pause here?</b>

790
00:58:12,826 --> 00:58:13,926
<b>-Here?
-Yes.</b>

791
00:58:19,626 --> 00:58:20,666
<b>Stop.</b>

792
00:58:21,636 --> 00:58:23,636
<b>Stop! I told you to stop!</b>

793
00:58:30,376 --> 00:58:31,406
<b>This woman...</b>

794
00:58:48,656 --> 00:58:50,526
<b>What are you doing?
Are you looking for someone?</b>

795
00:58:53,226 --> 00:58:55,536
<b>Just wondering where everyone is.</b>

796
00:58:55,796 --> 00:58:57,366
<b>Seol-a is at Yoon-ja's house</b>

797
00:58:57,736 --> 00:58:59,506
<b>and I got Da-hoon to pick her up.</b>

798
00:59:01,136 --> 00:59:03,876
<b>But why do you want to know that
all of a sudden?</b>

799
00:59:04,276 --> 00:59:05,646
<b>Well, it's because...</b>

800
00:59:06,176 --> 00:59:09,246
<b>I was just trying to avoid you, obviously.</b>

801
00:59:09,316 --> 00:59:11,286
<b>You think that'll be possible
when we live together?</b>

802
00:59:11,346 --> 00:59:13,146
<b>So what? You're kicking me out?</b>

803
00:59:13,286 --> 00:59:15,986
<b>-I didn't say that.
-Whatever. Forget it.</b>

804
00:59:24,966 --> 00:59:26,666
<b>I'll go this way.</b>

805
00:59:27,536 --> 00:59:29,096
<b>You go that way.</b>

806
00:59:42,746 --> 00:59:44,316
<b>This is tiring.</b>

807
00:59:47,456 --> 00:59:49,056
<b>Why can't I stop thinking of her?</b>

808
00:59:59,766 --> 01:00:02,236
<b>Why should I be the only one
to feel embarrassed?</b>

809
01:00:02,636 --> 01:00:03,696
<b>Seriously.</b>

810
01:00:05,966 --> 01:00:08,176
<b>I'm fine, too.</b>

811
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:10,846
<b>I'll pretend that I'm confident.</b>

812
01:00:11,276 --> 01:00:12,276
<b>No,</b>

813
01:00:13,346 --> 01:00:14,546
<b>I am confident.</b>

814
01:00:26,426 --> 01:00:27,556
<b>She's alive?</b>

815
01:00:28,256 --> 01:00:29,326
<b>Are you sure?</b>

816
01:00:30,826 --> 01:00:31,826
<b>Yes.</b>

817
01:00:34,596 --> 01:00:35,736
<b>Then why...</b>

818
01:00:53,986 --> 01:00:55,256
<b>Make sure to pass on what I say.</b>

819
01:00:56,556 --> 01:00:57,786
<b>Find the woman</b>

820
01:00:59,126 --> 01:01:00,326
<b>and kill her</b>

821
01:01:02,956 --> 01:01:04,226
<b>without anyone knowing.</b>

822
01:01:22,846 --> 01:01:26,546
<b>[Eccentric! Chef Moon]</b>

823

<b>[So, you're in love?]</b>

824
01:01:49,406 --> 01:01:50,946
<b>[Don't say that in front of your dad!]</b>

825
01:01:51,006 --> 01:01:53,806
<b>[-Thank you, Chef Moon.
-What are you two doing?]</b>

826
01:01:54,846 --> 01:01:59,786
<b>-Sorry, I misunderstood.
-What?</b>

827
01:01:59,846 --> 01:02:01,256
<b>You're the only one I have.</b>

828
01:02:02,816 --> 01:02:04,226
<b>[You're giving me a hard time.]</b>

829
01:02:04,286 --> 01:02:07,056
<b>[To be honest, I was going insane.]</b>

830
01:02:07,126 --> 01:02:10,296
<b>[Don't try too hard. The memories will
come back in time.]</b>

<b>[Where's Byeol-na? Is she kidnapped?]</b>

832

<b>[-Stop it!
-Dad!]</b>

833
01:02:17,806 --> 01:02:18,906
<b>[Seriously?]</b>

<b>[She's kidnapped.

<b>Byeol-na!</b>
