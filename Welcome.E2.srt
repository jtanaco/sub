<b>But still, he sometimes visits every once in a while.</b>

<b>So I can't put my place up for rent.</b>

00:12:38,441 --> 00:12:40,625
<b>If you're bored, you can watch this.</b>

159
00:12:40,943 --> 00:12:42,295
<b>I'm going to leave now.</b>

160
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:44,335
<b>I'm really leaving this time.</b>

161
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,195
<b>Why am I human...</b>

162
00:13:46,309 --> 00:13:48,195
<b>when she's not even around?</b>

163
00:13:52,315 --> 00:13:55,505
<b>Sol Ah, you must be so tired.</b>

164
00:13:55,551 --> 00:13:56,810
<b>You took the day off yesterday...</b>

165
00:13:56,819 --> 00:13:59,375
<b>and probably had lots of fun.</b>

166
00:13:59,522 --> 00:14:01,450
<b>But you have to do that again because tomorrow is a holiday.</b>

167
00:14:01,457 --> 00:14:04,390
<b>No, it's not that. It's because I moved yesterday.</b>

168
00:14:04,393 --> 00:14:07,515
<b>Ji Eun, I heard you're moving today. You should go home.</b>

169
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:10,085
<b>I'll go after I'm done with this.</b>

170
00:14:10,132 --> 00:14:11,230
<b>Sol Ah, you should help.</b>

171
00:14:11,234 --> 00:14:13,155
<b>Help a colleague.</b>

172
00:14:14,804 --> 00:14:17,470
<b>Organize the references for the new children's wear project.</b>

173
00:14:17,473 --> 00:14:18,840
<b>And these are the materials for the organic grain powder.</b>

174
00:14:18,841 --> 00:14:20,795
<b>Find adequate images for the concept.</b>

175
00:14:22,044 --> 00:14:23,495
<b>Get rid of the background image.</b>

176
00:14:23,512 --> 00:14:25,795
<b>Make sure you do a delicate job.</b>

177
00:14:26,249 --> 00:14:27,850
<b>No, I can do it myself.</b>

178
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:30,135
<b>You're still here? You should go.</b>

179
00:14:30,152 --> 00:14:32,335
<b>You need to move today. Go on.</b>

180
00:14:34,657 --> 00:14:36,875
<b>Yes, you should go. I'll do it instead.</b>

181
00:14:43,599 --> 00:14:45,785
<b>She has it easy thanks to her connections.</b>

182
00:14:46,035 --> 00:14:48,055
<b>On the other hand, you're doomed.</b>

183
00:14:58,014 --> 00:15:01,505
<b>These birds stay on the trees...</b>

184
00:15:01,784 --> 00:15:04,035
<b>and mate when the seasons...</b>

185
00:15:14,463 --> 00:15:16,160
<b>Sol Ah, take a nap if you're tired.</b>

186
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,330
<b>Okay, thanks.</b>

187
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,430
<b>Bye, Sol Ah.</b>

188
00:15:18,434 --> 00:15:19,930
<b>Bye. Take care.</b>

189
00:15:19,936 --> 00:15:21,425
<b>- See you. - Bye.</b>

190
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,315
<b>When will she come back?</b>

191
00:16:01,744 --> 00:16:03,165
<b>I'm done.</b>

192
00:16:22,932 --> 00:16:25,230
<b>The unexpected downpour...</b>

193
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:30,185
<b>is causing havoc for people who didn't bring umbrellas.</b>

194
00:16:42,318 --> 00:16:44,105
<b>It's raining way too hard.</b>

195
00:17:09,412 --> 00:17:10,965
<b>Why won't I change?</b>

196
00:17:16,185 --> 00:17:18,135
<b>Am I okay up to the garden?</b>

197
00:17:41,944 --> 00:17:43,425
<b>I still haven't changed?</b>

198
00:17:44,413 --> 00:17:46,095
<b>I left the house...</b>

199
00:17:47,283 --> 00:17:48,765
<b>and I'm still human?</b>

200
00:18:27,156 --> 00:18:28,605
<b>I'm human again?</b>

201
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,845
<b>How is this possible?</b>

202
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:36,375
<b>Her belongings.</b>

203
00:19:38,127 --> 00:19:39,645
<b>Her smell.</b>

204
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,705
<b>You moved to a house in this area?</b>

205
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:18,245
<b>Well... It's not this way.</b>

206
00:21:18,827 --> 00:21:21,560
<b>It's that way. Over there.</b>

207
00:21:21,563 --> 00:21:23,215
<b>I can manage from here.</b>

208
00:21:23,632 --> 00:21:24,900
<b>Which direction is it?</b>

209
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,315
<b>What?</b>

210
00:21:26,935 --> 00:21:29,625
<b>So... It's...</b>

211
00:21:30,072 --> 00:21:36,565
<b>It's way...over there.</b>

212
00:21:40,249 --> 00:21:41,450
<b>I'll take a detour.</b>

213
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:43,610
<b>Don't do that. It's quite far away.</b>

214
00:21:43,619 --> 00:21:46,220
<b>The terrain's rough, there's a steep incline,</b>

215
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:48,405
<b>- and the road's crooked... - You acted weird last time.</b>

216
00:21:48,457 --> 00:21:50,105
<b>Where exactly do you live?</b>

217
00:21:53,462 --> 00:21:54,830
<b>Well...</b>

218
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,485
<b>(Sonamu)</b>

219
00:22:06,809 --> 00:22:08,665
<b>Don't get me wrong.</b>

220
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:12,180
<b>The house happens to belong to the woman my dad married,</b>

221
00:22:12,181 --> 00:22:14,140
<b>and I happened to have no idea.</b>

222
00:22:14,149 --> 00:22:16,110
<b>I'd never have moved in if I'd known.</b>

223
00:22:16,118 --> 00:22:19,020
<b>I'd have done anything I could to find another place.</b>

224
00:22:19,021 --> 00:22:21,235
<b>I really didn't know.</b>

225
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:23,175
<b>I really didn't.</b>

226
00:22:24,526 --> 00:22:26,115
<b>You're acting weird.</b>

227
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:28,845
<b>I knew it.</b>

228
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:31,145
<b>See? You got the wrong idea.</b>

229
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,830
<b>I thought you would, so I couldn't tell you.</b>

230
00:22:33,836 --> 00:22:36,225
<b>That's why I hid and sneaked glances.</b>

231
00:22:37,573 --> 00:22:39,200
<b>It's not like that at all.</b>

232
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:40,695
<b>That's not what I meant.</b>

233
00:22:54,823 --> 00:22:56,675
<b>See? You're boiling.</b>

234
00:22:58,427 --> 00:22:59,875
<b>You have a fever.</b>

235
00:23:04,433 --> 00:23:06,385
<b>I didn't expect that from you.</b>

236
00:23:06,935 --> 00:23:08,325
<b>You're blushing.</b>

237
00:23:33,228 --> 00:23:35,945
<b>Hey, kitty. How are you?</b>

238
00:23:36,265 --> 00:23:38,685
<b>Oh? Kitty.</b>

239
00:23:39,234 --> 00:23:41,155
<b>Kitty.</b>

240
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:43,555
<b>Meow.</b>

241
00:23:48,911 --> 00:23:50,725
<b>Did I leave it open?</b>

242
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:56,565
<b>Let's see.</b>

243
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,735
<b>Here.</b>

244
00:24:01,457 --> 00:24:04,345
<b>Stay still, will you?</b>

245
00:24:04,426 --> 00:24:05,815
<b>Keep still.</b>

246
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:09,345
<b>Keep still.</b>

247
00:24:11,834 --> 00:24:13,685
<b>He didn't eat at all.</b>

248
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:18,455
<b>Shall I give him some milk?</b>

249
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,865
<b>How about a new name?</b>

250
00:24:28,617 --> 00:24:30,710
<b>What kind of a cat's name is Sergei?</b>

251
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:33,305
<b>You don't come when I call that name anyway.</b>

252
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:37,845
<b>What should I call you?</b>

253
00:24:45,167 --> 00:24:46,555
<b>Hong Jo.</b>

254
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,955
<b>You can be Hong Jo.</b>

255
00:24:49,938 --> 00:24:53,425
<b>You're Hong Jo while you're with me, okay?</b>

256
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:56,495
<b>Hong Jo.</b>

257
00:24:57,513 --> 00:24:59,295
<b>Hong Jo.</b>

258
00:24:59,715 --> 00:25:01,295
<b>Answer me.</b>

259
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:03,335
<b>Hong Jo.</b>

260
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,520
<b>Hong Jo. Hong Jo.</b>

261
00:25:07,523 --> 00:25:10,045
<b>How about... Darn it.</b>

262
00:25:12,494 --> 00:25:13,875
<b>Hey.</b>

263
00:25:15,163 --> 00:25:17,485
<b>My gosh, are you serious?</b>

264
00:25:35,884 --> 00:25:37,665
<b>I didn't know this was here.</b>

265
00:26:04,379 --> 00:26:06,795
<b>You're drawing Beodul Love again?</b>

266
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,405
<b>You have such elegant taste.</b>

267
00:26:08,417 --> 00:26:10,105
<b>What's wrong with that?</b>

268
00:26:10,686 --> 00:26:13,205
<b>Beodul Love is my ideal type.</b>

269
00:26:14,756 --> 00:26:16,105
<b>Hello?</b>

270
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,975
<b>Yes, Dad. Yes.</b>

271
00:26:23,732 --> 00:26:25,785
<b>Okay, I'll see you at home.</b>

272
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,355
<b>Okay, bye.</b>

273
00:26:30,138 --> 00:26:31,995
<b>He's even awkward with his parents.</b>

274
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:36,065
<b>Hey, did you recently meet your parents or something?</b>

275
00:26:38,246 --> 00:26:41,735
<b>Yes, I was adopted only three years ago.</b>

276
00:26:55,964 --> 00:26:57,345
<b>Hey.</b>

277
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:02,885
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

278
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:06,325
<b>I was joking earlier, but it must've offended you.</b>

279
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,095
<b>No, not really.</b>

280
00:27:17,586 --> 00:27:18,935
<b>You see...</b>

281
00:27:20,689 --> 00:27:22,745
<b>I don't have a mom either.</b>

282
00:27:24,192 --> 00:27:26,115
<b>She recently passed away.</b>

283
00:27:31,533 --> 00:27:33,630
<b>After my mom died, my dad fell into depression.</b>

284
00:27:33,635 --> 00:27:35,700
<b>He doesn't eat, smile, or talk.</b>

285
00:27:35,704 --> 00:27:38,025
<b>It's as if his time just stopped.</b>

286
00:27:43,378 --> 00:27:45,195
<b>Why are you telling me that?</b>

287
00:27:45,614 --> 00:27:46,995
<b>What?</b>

288
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:51,805
<b>That way, it'll be fair.</b>

289
00:27:52,487 --> 00:27:54,505
<b>It's okay. Please just be quiet.</b>

290
00:27:55,557 --> 00:27:57,675
<b>Hey, come on.</b>

291
00:27:58,193 --> 00:28:00,220
<b>I feel like I made a mistake because I didn't know you that well.</b>

292
00:28:00,228 --> 00:28:01,760
<b>So we should get to know each other.</b>

293
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:04,560
<b>We might have some similarities.</b>

294
00:28:04,566 --> 00:28:06,060
<b>And when you open up your secrets,</b>

295
00:28:06,068 --> 00:28:08,655
<b>- you naturally become friends. - You're so loud.</b>

296
00:28:11,473 --> 00:28:12,895
<b>Sorry.</b>

297
00:28:14,076 --> 00:28:17,125
<b>I tend to talk a lot.</b>

298
00:28:17,646 --> 00:28:19,665
<b>I'm always like that with my dad...</b>

299
00:28:21,883 --> 00:28:23,465
<b>I did it again.</b>

300
00:28:27,022 --> 00:28:30,545
<b>I don't know why I tend to talk so much...</b>

301
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,145
<b>Are you leaving?</b>

302
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:43,055
<b>You're not leaving?</b>

303
00:28:44,773 --> 00:28:47,495
<b>- Then can I keep... - Keep your mouth shut.</b>

304
00:28:47,843 --> 00:28:49,195
<b>Okay.</b>

305
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:04,545
<b>Hey, the thing is, I kind of tend to...</b>

306
00:29:32,254 --> 00:29:33,675
<b>I found him.</b>

307
00:29:34,289 --> 00:29:35,745
<b>My Beodul Love.</b>

308
00:29:42,831 --> 00:29:45,200
<b>They're not facing each other,</b>

309
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,855
<b>so they don't need to force themselves to talk.</b>

310
00:29:50,238 --> 00:29:51,970
<b>He just stayed by her side.</b>

311
00:29:51,973 --> 00:29:53,070
<b>(My Helpless Beodul Love)</b>

312
00:29:53,074 --> 00:29:55,055
<b>He didn't want her to try too hard.</b>

313
00:29:55,844 --> 00:29:58,295
<b>She didn't need to do anything.</b>

314
00:29:59,147 --> 00:30:00,695
<b>He wanted her to rest.</b>

315
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:07,805
<b>They weren't awkward in the silence.</b>

01:03:46,706 --> 01:03:48,395
<b>It's not for your wrist.</b>

635
01:03:48,942 --> 01:03:50,455
<b>What?</b>

636
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:53,165
<b>Oh, no wonder it was a bit big.</b>

637
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:55,235
<b>It's an anklet.</b>

638
01:03:56,015 --> 01:03:57,535
<b>It's a collar for the cat.</b>

639
01:03:58,685 --> 01:04:01,435
<b>- What? - It's for Sergei.</b>

640
01:04:03,323 --> 01:04:04,705
<b>Oh.</b>

641
01:04:06,726 --> 01:04:09,975
<b>You didn't carve its name on it, did you?</b>

642
01:04:10,363 --> 01:04:13,185
<b>He has a new name. It's not Sergei.</b>

643
01:04:13,199 --> 01:04:14,330
<b>Why?</b>

644
01:04:14,334 --> 01:04:17,155
<b>You'll send him away soon anyway. Why confuse him?</b>

645
01:04:17,804 --> 01:04:20,470
<b>- What did you name him? - I won't tell you.</b>

646
01:04:20,473 --> 01:04:23,495
<b>Since I'll send him away, I'll keep his new name to myself.</b>

647
01:04:24,677 --> 01:04:27,065
<b>He won't respond to it anyway.</b>

648
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,140
<b>He was Sergei since he was a kitten.</b>

649
01:04:29,148 --> 01:04:31,665
<b>No. He looks at me when I call him.</b>

650
01:04:32,452 --> 01:04:33,880
<b>What did you call him?</b>

651
01:04:33,887 --> 01:04:36,105
<b>If I say "Hong Jo", he looks...</b>

652
01:04:51,437 --> 01:04:52,885
<b>I said it.</b>

653
01:04:54,007 --> 01:04:55,395
<b>"Hong Jo"?</b>

654
01:04:55,875 --> 01:04:57,895
<b>I didn't expect that from you.</b>

655
01:04:59,345 --> 01:05:02,035
<b>- What? - You're blushing.</b>

656
01:05:15,662 --> 01:05:17,075
<b>The pot.</b>

657
01:05:21,901 --> 01:05:23,285
<b>Ouch.</b>

658
01:05:24,904 --> 01:05:26,385
<b>Hey, did you...</b>

659
01:05:38,885 --> 01:05:40,235
<b>Will you...</b>

660
01:05:41,287 --> 01:05:43,775
<b>Don't worry. I won't get the wrong idea.</b>

661
01:05:46,259 --> 01:05:47,645
<b>What if it's...</b>

662
01:05:49,929 --> 01:05:51,345
<b>the right idea?</b>

663
01:06:38,611 --> 01:06:41,895
<b>(GFRIEND's Umji's OST "Welcome" has been released.)</b>

664

<b>(Meow, the Secret Boy)</b>

665
01:06:58,264 --> 01:07:00,630
<b>I think that guy is a cat.</b>

666
01:07:00,633 --> 01:07:02,230
<b>He could really be a weirdo.</b>

667
01:07:02,235 --> 01:07:04,200
<b>He's like a kid. He needs looking after.</b>

668
01:07:04,203 --> 01:07:06,370
<b>I told you to be careful. It's dangerous.</b>

669
01:07:06,372 --> 01:07:07,770
<b>That man?</b>

670
01:07:07,774 --> 01:07:09,540
<b>I don't know what he's thinking.</b>

671
01:07:09,542 --> 01:07:12,725
<b>What more is there to say? It's just you.</b>

672
01:07:13,179 --> 01:07:16,595
<b>That guy who came over. He's the Beodul Love, right?</b>
