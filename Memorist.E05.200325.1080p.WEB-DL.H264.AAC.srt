<b>(Dong Baek)</b>

159
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,075
<b>(Dongbaek Station)</b>

160
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:07,984
<b>Where do you live?</b>

161
00:12:08,909 --> 00:12:10,214
<b>You don't seem familiar.</b>

162
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,785
<b>Are you sick, kid?</b>

163
00:12:19,389 --> 00:12:21,964
<b>Kid? Kid!</b>

164
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:26,364
<b>A kid just collapsed. Hurry!</b>

165
00:12:45,649 --> 00:12:47,185
<b>Metro isn't saying much.</b>

166
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,919
<b>They already took photos.</b>

167
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:50,155
<b>Of course they're not interested.</b>

168
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:52,494
<b>Only I know this face and composition.</b>

169
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,864
<b>So where exactly did you see this?</b>

170
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,165
<b>I'll tell you when it's time.</b>

171
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,805
<b>And when will that be?</b>

172
00:13:00,889 --> 00:13:02,500
<b>Always so cryptic.</b>

173
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,435
<b>It was dropped off two days ago.</b>

174
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,575
<b>I doubt you deal with paintings like this here.</b>

175
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,045
<b>It's why I was going to send it back immediately,</b>

176
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,069
<b>but there wasn't a contact number.</b>

177
00:13:14,069 --> 00:13:15,210
<b>Nothing?</b>

178
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:16,815
<b>There was no waybill either.</b>

179
00:13:17,179 --> 00:13:19,354
<b>Any small detail at this point would help.</b>

180
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:21,285
<b>It wasn't anything weird,</b>

181
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:24,624
<b>but Mr. Park seemed highly satisfied with it.</b>

182
00:13:29,189 --> 00:13:30,594
<b>He must've been satisfied with it,</b>

183
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,464
<b>considering how he looked at it for hours.</b>

184
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:35,874
<b>Shouldn't this be an insult to him?</b>

185
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,100
<b>Exactly. How weird.</b>

186
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,275
<b>Hold on.</b>

187
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,175
<b>What is it?</b>

188
00:13:43,539 --> 00:13:47,384
<b>Wait a second. This seems off.</b>

189
00:13:47,809 --> 00:13:48,955
<b>What does?</b>

190
00:13:49,179 --> 00:13:50,614
<b>That wasn't it.</b>

191
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:54,925
<b>When I unwrapped it,</b>

192
00:13:57,779 --> 00:13:59,394
<b>I saw a blade.</b>

193
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,894
<b>A long blade.</b>

194
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,734
<b>What on earth?</b>

195
00:14:09,929 --> 00:14:11,134
<b>There was another layer.</b>

196
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,175
<b>Another layer?</b>

197
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:16,244
<b>The killer peeled it off.</b>

198
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:28,818
<b>He was found at a way station at the age of seven.</b>

199
00:14:28,819 --> 00:14:30,695
<b>He wouldn't speak let alone say his name,</b>

200
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:32,189
<b>so he bounced from facilities for the disabled...</b>

201
00:14:32,189 --> 00:14:33,624
<b>before landing in an orphanage.</b>

202
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:36,389
<b>He was named after Dongbaek Station where he was found.</b>

203
00:14:36,389 --> 00:14:38,234
<b>Nothing worth noticing happened while growing up.</b>

204
00:14:38,319 --> 00:14:40,705
<b>He revealed his abilities at the age of 20,</b>

205
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:44,330
<b>was offered countless jobs, but he chose to become a cop.</b>

206
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:46,705
<b>- Why? - There's an interview.</b>

207
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:52,744
<b>The justice system is the best way to catch the bad guys, right?</b>

208
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,915
<b>What a nutjob.</b>

209
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:00,525
<b>He turned down millions of dollars for 2,000 dollars a month.</b>

210
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:03,094
<b>That includes research funding from global companies.</b>

211
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,695
<b>What could it be?</b>

212
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:09,364
<b>Why did he choose the most illogical career path?</b>

213
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,234
<b>No one remembers him from his childhood days...</b>

214
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,935
<b>even though he's now an international celebrity.</b>

215
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:17,374
<b>I have the alibi video.</b>

216
00:15:20,429 --> 00:15:23,214
<b>The news team had him under surveillance.</b>

217
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:28,484
<b>He peeled off the top layer.</b>

218
00:15:29,139 --> 00:15:31,514
<b>So the one who sent this must be the perp.</b>

219
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:33,984
<b>Why though?</b>

220
00:15:34,179 --> 00:15:36,019
<b>Why risk getting caught?</b>

221
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:38,455
<b>- The perp was challenging him. - What?</b>

222
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,990
<b>It wasn't delivered by a company truck,</b>

223
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:41,695
<b>so it'll take time to track down.</b>

224
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:43,734
<b>There aren't CCTV cameras in the area either.</b>

225
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,565
<b>- Where's that guy? - I'll bring him back.</b>

226
00:15:46,789 --> 00:15:47,964
<b>What do you think you're doing?</b>

227
00:15:48,689 --> 00:15:50,059
<b>You said you were done processing this place.</b>

228
00:15:50,059 --> 00:15:51,159
<b>Hello, ma'am.</b>

229
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:52,769
<b>I already spoke to your husband.</b>

230
00:15:52,769 --> 00:15:55,474
<b>Mr. Park is in this mess because of you people.</b>

231
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,114
<b>- Leave. Get out! - What?</b>

232
00:15:58,139 --> 00:16:00,244
<b>- Leave! - Sure, we're leaving.</b>

233
00:16:00,269 --> 00:16:01,484
<b>Let's go.</b>

234
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,014
<b>The devil's spawns.</b>

235
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:09,624
<b>Unbelievable. Her faith is still intact.</b>

236
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,025
<b>Have Forensics confiscate the painting.</b>

237
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,289
<b>What about the delivery truck?</b>

238
00:16:13,289 --> 00:16:14,665
<b>I need manpower to track it down.</b>

239
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:17,065
<b>Why don't we let Metro take the case?</b>

240
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,604
<b>We'll be shoved aside since it's not in our jurisdiction anyway.</b>

241
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,065
<b>I saw it.</b>

242
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,244
<b>I saw the delivery truck.</b>

243
00:16:30,269 --> 00:16:32,075
<b>Did you really see the delivery truck?</b>

244
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:34,244
<b>How about the license plate?</b>

245
00:16:34,539 --> 00:16:36,055
<b>That I don't remember,</b>

246
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:39,580
<b>but a phone number in huge letters was written on the side.</b>

247
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,085
<b>- Really? - Really?</b>

248
00:16:41,409 --> 00:16:42,594
<b>And the numbers?</b>

249
00:16:42,649 --> 00:16:45,094
<b>How should I know? I wouldn't have memorized it.</b>

250
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,994
<b>What? Then what is it that you know?</b>

251
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,165
<b>You can do your thing.</b>

252
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:52,165
<b>The memory scan.</b>

253
00:16:52,889 --> 00:16:54,764
<b>You shouldn't mess with grown-ups.</b>

254
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:57,374
<b>No, I'll do it.</b>

255
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,729
<b>On one condition.</b>

256
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:01,974
<b>- On one condition? - I want your phone number.</b>

257
00:17:02,569 --> 00:17:05,344
<b>- Sure thing. 010... - She was asking for mine.</b>

258
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:08,244
<b>No, yours.</b>

259
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:10,984
<b>Who else would I want to contact?</b>

260
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,354
<b>What?</b>

261
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:14,825
<b>- Mind your business, old man. - Old man?</b>

262
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,480
<b>I'm two years younger than he is.</b>

263
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,864
<b>- You see... - Is that all you want?</b>

264
00:17:21,689 --> 00:17:23,964
<b>- I'll take it the way I want. - The way you want?</b>

265
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:32,945
<b>Nothing's out of the ordinary.</b>

266
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,285
<b>Hold it. Check that light.</b>

267
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:48,825
<b>A motion sensor light in the stairway?</b>

268
00:17:48,849 --> 00:17:51,349
<b>The one downstairs didn't turn on. Maybe it malfunctioned.</b>

269
00:17:51,349 --> 00:17:53,765
<b>How many times did the lights in the 3rd and 4th floor go on?</b>

270
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,664
<b>Let me check. Twice.</b>

271
00:17:57,319 --> 00:17:59,565
<b>Once at midnight and once at 4am.</b>

272
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:02,835
<b>Four hours from his house and back.</b>

273

<b>The rooftop.</b>

274
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,904
<b>Rooftop?</b>

275
00:18:09,269 --> 00:18:10,644
<b>That's how he got out.</b>

276
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:21,525
<b>Here.</b>

277
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,404
<b>Don't be too late.</b>

278
00:18:45,869 --> 00:18:47,944
<b>(Daeguk Deliveries)</b>

279
00:19:21,609 --> 00:19:22,755
<b>Okay.</b>

280
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:28,585
<b>He could've gone anywhere without being caught on camera.</b>

281
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,725
<b>That's only if he could jump across that.</b>

282
00:19:31,779 --> 00:19:34,565
<b>Ma'am. I really can't stand Dong Baek,</b>

283
00:19:34,619 --> 00:19:35,894
<b>but this isn't right.</b>

284
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:37,759
<b>He jumped that in the middle of the night?</b>

285
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,735
<b>He'd die if he missed even slightly.</b>

286
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,190
<b>He despises murder.</b>

287
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:45,970
<b>I heard Occam's Razor is about eliminating complicated theories.</b>

288
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:48,174
<b>But this is so complicated, that I can't even imagine it.</b>

289
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,344
<b>These are the theories that we should eliminate first.</b>

290
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:52,745
<b>That's right.</b>

291
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:54,585
<b>Over there.</b>

292
00:19:54,869 --> 00:19:57,654
<b>Hi. I have the blood test results of the witnesses.</b>

293
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:01,025
<b>A sleeping gas was detected in small amounts.</b>

294
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:03,049
<b>If they fainted due to the gas...</b>

295
00:20:03,049 --> 00:20:05,325
<b>It wasn't the use of supernatural powers.</b>

296
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:09,618
<b>Then is Dong Baek removed from the list of suspects?</b>

297
00:20:09,619 --> 00:20:12,664
<b>Hey. Why are you so happy? Aren't you enemies?</b>

298
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,335
<b>I wasn't happy.</b>

299
00:20:15,829 --> 00:20:17,535
<b>We'll keep the option open that supernatural powers were used.</b>

300
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:19,545
<b>- What? - What?</b>

301
00:20:19,629 --> 00:20:20,798
<b>Question the people in the area.</b>

302

<b>Yes, ma'am.</b>

<b>we do not see any special abnormalities.</b>

<b>In order to determine the cause of the fainting...</b>

<b>Superintendent Han Sun Mi needs to talk to you.</b>

307

<b>The patient will not cooperate.</b>

308

<b>Other vitals and body index are stable.</b>

309

<b>I plan to suggest a more detailed CT scan of the brain.</b>

<b>I had to come anyway on another matter.</b>

<b>have been treating Dong Baek?</b>

315
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,285
<b>- I don't know. - 12 department chiefs.</b>

316
00:21:09,049 --> 00:21:11,025
<b>- That's a lot. - The department of neurology alone.</b>

317
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,720
<b>There are 40 if you include other departments.</b>

318
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,819
<b>If you include the staff, add another zero.</b>

319

<b>If you include the teams abroad, add another zero.</b>

<b>I can see that.</b>

321

<b>You must not get it.</b>

<b>I understand.</b>

<b>I don't think you do,</b>

325

<b>it's not just a matter of a patient's confidential data.</b>

<b>by leaking information to a cop she doesn't even know?</b>

328

<b>That's nonsense.</b>

329
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:48,594
<b>What if we do this?</b>

330
00:21:49,789 --> 00:21:51,465
<b>What if I bring a warrant?</b>

331
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:54,005
<b>Will you still refuse to cooperate?</b>

00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:00,104
<b>You must be asking because that's impossible.</b>

<b>Thank you for making time for me.</b>

334

<b>But...</b>

335
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,124
<b>you never asked...</b>

336
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:18,055
<b>why I'm willing to request a warrant to investigate him.</b>

337
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:22,765
<b>- Well... - Is this why?</b>

338
00:22:24,819 --> 00:22:28,364
<b>Because you've already concluded that he may be dangerous.</b>

00:55:34,158 --> 00:55:36,244
<b>Send everyone! It's a trap!</b>

781
00:55:36,998 --> 00:55:38,213
<b>A trap?</b>

782
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:41,839
<b>The person who was planning to move there had a stroke.</b>

783
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:43,544
<b>So it's been empty for a year.</b>

784
00:55:57,549 --> 00:55:59,894
<b>Darn it.</b>

785
00:56:00,388 --> 00:56:01,733
<b>It's a trap.</b>

786
00:58:16,089 --> 00:58:17,434
<b>It's a corpse.</b>

787
00:58:31,408 --> 00:58:32,779
<b>Angel of the Lord</b>

788
00:58:32,779 --> 00:58:34,053
<b>My guardian dear</b>

789
00:58:37,049 --> 00:58:38,624
<b>To whom</b>

790
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:40,994
<b>- His love commits me here - To whom His love commits me here</b>

791
00:58:41,689 --> 00:58:44,564
<b>Ever this day be at my side</b>

792
00:58:44,589 --> 00:58:46,719
<b>To light and guard</b>

793
00:58:46,719 --> 00:58:49,133
<b>- To rule and guide - To rule and guide</b>

794
00:58:49,529 --> 00:58:51,604
<b>- Amen. - Amen.</b>

795
00:58:52,058 --> 00:58:53,273
<b>Amen!</b>

796
00:59:28,129 --> 00:59:31,198
<b>(Memorist)</b>

797
00:59:31,198 --> 00:59:33,839
<b>Do you know the juvenile double jeopardy case?</b>

798
00:59:33,839 --> 00:59:36,469
<b>Six years ago, a little girl who was an orphan died.</b>

799
00:59:36,469 --> 00:59:38,613
<b>And the culprits turned out to be middle school girls.</b>

800
00:59:38,678 --> 00:59:39,954
<b>An execution-style murder.</b>

801
00:59:40,239 --> 00:59:43,253
<b>Punishing evil by becoming evil themselves.</b>

802
00:59:43,379 --> 00:59:45,053
<b>The exact same thing is happening again.</b>

803
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:47,053
<b>It's just like what happened 20 years ago.</b>

804
00:59:47,078 --> 00:59:49,394
<b>The special team has no records of it at all?</b>

805
00:59:49,589 --> 00:59:50,764
<b>The person in charge of the investigation...</b>

806
00:59:51,719 --> 00:59:53,419
<b>- What? - It's someone close by.</b>

807
00:59:53,419 --> 00:59:54,558
<b>Someone who's high up.</b>

808
00:59:54,558 --> 00:59:55,664
<b>That's pretty close by.</b>

809
00:59:56,089 --> 00:59:57,204
<b>It's him.</b>
