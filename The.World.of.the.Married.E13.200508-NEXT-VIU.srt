00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:26,330
<b>I think you made a mistake.</b>

162
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:28,470
<b>He can be grumpy,</b>

163
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,600
<b>but he wouldn't do anything bad.</b>

164
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,360
<b>I trust he doesn't do it if he says so.</b>

165
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:36,710
<b>Even if he does, we can just reason with him.</b>

166
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,680
<b>He's going through puberty.</b>

167
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:41,950
<b>Thank you.</b>

168
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,480
<b>You should pay more attention to him too.</b>

169
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,250
<b>Let's make dinner now.</b>

170
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:51,690
<b>Okay.</b>

171
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:00,630
<b>Jenny.</b>

172
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,400
<b>Did it hurt a lot?</b>

173
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:05,830
<b>In front of you.</b>

174
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,640
<b>- This makes me mad. - Hurry up and shoot.</b>

175
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,830
<b>Get up. Get up.</b>

176
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,270
<b>Watch it.</b>

177
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,410
<b>What are you doing?</b>

178
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:15,150
<b>Stop doing that.</b>

179
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:17,120
<b>Hey, kill that one.</b>

180
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,990
<b>- He's the ace. - I don't think so.</b>

181
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:21,390
<b>In the back. Back up.</b>

182
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,990
<b>In the middle, pick up the gun.</b>

183
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:25,850
<b>- Sorry. - Shoot again.</b>

184
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:27,520
<b>- Okay, okay. - What are you doing?</b>

185
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,020
<b>Hurry up. Come on.</b>

186
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:32,590
<b>Just go in.</b>

187
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:35,090
<b>- Just listen to me and throw it. - Me first.</b>

188
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,740
<b>How?</b>

189
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,410
<b>You're late.</b>

190
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,910
<b>I was hanging out with my friends.</b>

191
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,720
<b>I heard you're on a break starting tomorrow.</b>

192
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,920
<b>Let's go see your mom in the evening.</b>

193
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:55,690
<b>I think she has something to say to you.</b>

194
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,690
<b>About what?</b>

195
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,660
<b>I think she's planning to leave town,</b>

196
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:03,430
<b>but she wants to discuss it with you.</b>

197
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,400
<b>I'll bring Joon Young to your place tomorrow evening.</b>

198
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:48,470
<b>What's wrong? Does it taste bad?</b>

199
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,530
<b>I only followed the recipe.</b>

200
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:53,500
<b>No, it's not that bad.</b>

201
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,740
<b>Are those new clothes?</b>

202
00:20:57,410 --> 00:21:00,240
<b>It's pretty. It suits you.</b>

203
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:05,150
<b>You always looked good in those colors.</b>

204
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,050
<b>It's too late.</b>

205
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,230
<b>I mean, it's too late for us.</b>

206
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:19,290
<b>I bought this three years ago.</b>

207
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,640
<b>And you want me to do what with you?</b>

208
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:26,440
<b>I don't want to make a fool of myself.</b>

209
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,180
<b>Let's stop, okay?</b>

210
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:41,740
<b>I know it's too late.</b>

211
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:44,960
<b>I missed so many opportunities to work things out.</b>

212
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,690
<b>But...</b>

213
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,700
<b>I don't want to end it like this.</b>

214
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:57,490
<b>We got married and got a divorce.</b>

215
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:59,260
<b>But we never dated each other.</b>

216
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:02,270
<b>We got married because our parents thought we'd be a good match.</b>

217
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:04,270
<b>So we just skipped everything...</b>

218
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,910
<b>and didn't get to know each other.</b>

219
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:09,040
<b>That's where it all went wrong.</b>

220
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,540
<b>I know this isn't the right order,</b>

221
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,840
<b>but I want to do everything I never got to do with you.</b>

222
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:18,630
<b>We can always end it after we try everything.</b>

223
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:20,190
<b>Okay?</b>

224
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:25,400
<b>I didn't know you could be so clingy.</b>

225
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:29,940
<b>- Is it annoying? - I'm not interested in this game.</b>

226
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:33,030
<b>I always thought...</b>

227
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,180
<b>my job was to earn you money.</b>

228
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:41,710
<b>I never once cleaned or cooked for you.</b>

229
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,420
<b>I didn't know this before, but I finally realized something.</b>

230
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,280
<b>All the stuff you did...</b>

231
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:53,820
<b>to quietly take care of me...</b>

232
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,900
<b>was what kept our marriage going.</b>

233
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:03,700
<b>I swear I don't think of this as a game.</b>

234
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:09,500
<b>I didn't know because I was indifferent and stupid.</b>

235
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,910
<b>And now, I want to do stuff...</b>

236
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:14,070
<b>that I never got to do for you.</b>

237
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:19,420
<b>You just need to take what I give.</b>

238
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:23,080
<b>Just think of it...</b>

239
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,550
<b>as a return on overdue mileage.</b>

240
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,900
<b>What's the worry?</b>

241
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,830
<b>You have nothing to lose.</b>

242
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:38,640
<b>You're all done.</b>

243
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:42,140
<b>Why? Are you not interested?</b>

244
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:43,980
<b>I'm not sure.</b>

245
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:47,910
<b>He's suddenly so different, so it's kind of scary.</b>

246
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:52,080
<b>And I'm worried I might be wasting my time.</b>

247
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,810
<b>- That's how I feel. - I think you still like him.</b>

248
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:57,720
<b>It's obvious how it'll end.</b>

249
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:01,230
<b>You should try everything you want before you die.</b>

250
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,900
<b>That way, you won't have any regrets.</b>

251
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,670
<b>Why don't you trust him this time?</b>

252
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:09,670
<b>I think he has finally learned his lesson.</b>

253
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:14,530
<b>How's my condition?</b>

254
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,680
<b>Last year, I was fine.</b>

255
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,540
<b>You said it felt like a period cramp, right?</b>

256
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,150
<b>It looks like a fibroid.</b>

257
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:30,720
<b>I don't think you need a biopsy.</b>

258
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,550
<b>It's nothing serious.</b>

259
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,230
<b>It's common at our age.</b>

260
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:43,240
<b>I thought it was due to stress, but I guess I'm not that healthy.</b>

261
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:48,000
<b>I'm starting to get depressed. I feel like I'm really getting old.</b>

262
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:49,440
<b>No one can beat time.</b>

263
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,770
<b>Let's see how it develops after you take your medicine.</b>

264
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:56,310
<b>If it doesn't get any bigger, you can just leave it.</b>

265
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,390
<b>It's almost time for lunch, isn't it?</b>

266
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,810
<b>- Okay, you can go now. - Thank you.</b>

267
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:16,290
<b>- Sun Woo. - What brings you here?</b>

268
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:19,240
<b>She's here to see you.</b>

269
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:20,640
<b>You're done with your morning consultations, right?</b>

270
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:22,000
<b>Let's eat lunch together.</b>

271
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:23,710
<b>I need to talk to you about something.</b>

272
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:27,180
<b>Judging from the look on your face, it sounds like it's good news.</b>

273
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:34,220
<b>I'm glad you're here. I also have something to tell you guys.</b>

274
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:36,780
<b>Have you made a decision?</b>

275
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:39,020
<b>Kind of.</b>

276
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:42,400
<b>Why don't I know what this is about?</b>

277
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,700
<b>Are you also seeing someone?</b>

278
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,990
<b>Did you get yourself a boyfriend?</b>

279
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,630
<b>Gosh, you're so lame.</b>

280
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,670
<b>Let's go. I'll tell you once we're there.</b>

281
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:56,640
<b>- Let's go. - Okay.</b>

<b>(Joon Young's homeroom teacher)</b>

283

<b>Hello?</b>

284
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:01,000
<b>Hello. How have you been?</b>

285
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,990
<b>Joon Young?</b>

286
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,120
<b>Okay, ma'am.</b>

287
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:11,080
<b>I'll be right there.</b>

288
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,500
<b>I'm sorry. Let's talk next time.</b>

289
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,330
<b>Don't worry about it. You should go.</b>

290
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,830
<b>Oh, right. The director isn't here, so I didn't get to tell him.</b>

291
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,910
<b>- Can you talk to him for me? - I'll explain to him.</b>

292
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:34,880
<b>Don't worry. Take good care of Joon Young.</b>

293
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,240
<b>We're no longer married.</b>

294
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:40,180
<b>But when it comes to our child, we're always asked to come together.</b>

295
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:43,070
<b>Why is that?</b>

296
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,490
<b>How long...</b>

297
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:50,690
<b>does a married couple's connection last?</b>

<b>(A World of Married Couple)</b>

<b>I heard you guys got a divorce.</b>

300
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:04,440
<b>May I ask whom Joon Young is living with?</b>

301
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,940
<b>I'm sorry if I made you feel uncomfortable.</b>

302
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:13,770
<b>But I want to have an objective view of Joon Young's situation.</b>

303
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,650
<b>Right now, he's living with me.</b>

304
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:23,490
<b>I heard he fought with Hae Kang.</b>

305
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:25,930
<b>Did he get severely injured?</b>

306
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:28,730
<b>Joon Young only got a few scratches.</b>

307
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:32,020
<b>But Hae Kang's condition was a lot worse.</b>

308
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:34,490
<b>So his parents took him home.</b>

309
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:38,670
<b>Judging from how it looks, we think Joon Young might've...</b>

310

<b>beat him up unilaterally.</b>

311

<b>What are you talking about?</b>

<b>- Are you sure about that? - We'd like to talk to Joon Young.</b>

313
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:53,150
<b>According to the kids, Joon Young hit him first.</b>

<b>It happened at the basketball court after school ended.</b>

00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:59,230
<b>So a lot of kids witnessed what happened.</b>

316
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,320
<b>Some kids even took videos.</b>

317
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:07,230
<b>Can we please meet Joon Young?</b>

318
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:11,290
<b>It's true. I hit him first.</b>

319
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:19,980
<b>Why did you hit him?</b>

320
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:23,570
<b>I'm sure you had a reason.</b>

321
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:27,840
<b>Aren't you going to tell us?</b>

322
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:31,660
<b>You need to tell us what happened, Joon Young.</b>

323
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:38,130
<b>Did Hae Kang talk badly about your mom again?</b>

324
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:39,970
<b>Is that why you hit him?</b>

325
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:43,440
<b>Tell me. What did he say?</b>

326
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,870
<b>I stole a bag of chips...</b>

327
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:48,910
<b>at the internet cafe.</b>

328
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,210
<b>And Hae Kang saw that.</b>

329
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:56,010
<b>He told me he'll tell everyone.</b>

330
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,650
<b>So I told him to go ahead.</b>

331
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:00,280
<b>What are you? A piece of trash?</b>

332
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:03,080
<b>- Live a decent life. - What did you say, you punk?</b>

333
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,390
<b>- What's going on? - Hey, stop.</b>

334
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,790
<b>- Hey, stop it. - Joon Young.</b>

335
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:23,270
<b>- Who do you think you are? - Hey, stop it.</b>

336
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,190
<b>That punk tried to lecture me, and it was annoying.</b>

337
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:47,060
<b>I think I just misheard something.</b>

338
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,140
<b>You stole what?</b>

339
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,170
<b>Okay, let's say you hit Hae Kang...</b>

340
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,070
<b>because you were angry.</b>

341
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:59,270
<b>But why did you steal?</b>

342
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,800
<b>Why would you do something like that?</b>

343
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:03,650
<b>It was a mistake.</b>

344
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:07,340
<b>You guys make mistakes, too.</b>

345
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:09,010
<b>Right?</b>

346
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:14,730
<b>Whatever the case, what you did was wrong.</b>

347
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:17,400
<b>You know you need to fix it until it's too late, right?</b>

348
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,320
<b>How do you fix a wrong that has already been done?</b>

349
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:22,990
<b>Isn't it too late?</b>

350
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,330
<b>You should apologize sincerely and ask for forgiveness...</b>

351
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:28,740
<b>from both Hae Kang and the Internet cafe owner.</b>

352
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:29,980
<b>Let's...</b>

353
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,570
<b>be calm and do one at a time.</b>

354
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,150
<b>The principal says...</b>

355
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:39,950
<b>they want to call a school violence hearing.</b>

356
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,190
<b>Shouldn't we meet with Hae Kang's parents first?</b>

357
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:44,080
<b>Why is everything so easy for you two?</b>

358
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:47,250
<b>Does apologizing make it forgivable?</b>

359
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:49,520
<b>Is that how it works for adults?</b>

360
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:55,590
<b>Joon Young. How could you say that?</b>

361
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:57,170
<b>We need to prevent the school violence hearing.</b>

362
00:31:57,170 --> 00:31:58,290
<b>Let them do it.</b>

363
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:00,640
<b>- It doesn't matter. - Lee Joon Young.</b>

364
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,300
<b>I won't go to this school.</b>

365
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,030
<b>I'll drop out! Problem solved!</b>

366
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:38,480
<b>What's with that attitude?</b>

367
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:41,550
<b>How could you say you'll drop out?</b>

368
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:47,990
<b>We're not telling you to apologize no matter what.</b>

369
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:51,090
<b>Let's talk first...</b>

370
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:53,460
<b>about why you did it,</b>

371
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:57,070
<b>and what you want to do going forward.</b>

372
00:32:57,570 --> 00:33:00,540
<b>Let's go to Mom's house and talk.</b>

373
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:03,610
<b>Why should I go there?</b>

374
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:05,980
<b>You can go if you want to.</b>

375
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:09,880
<b>Don't you want to go to my house?</b>

376
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,750
<b>No, I don't.</b>

377
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,280
<b>I have nothing more to say to you.</b>

378
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:34,200
<b>What was that about him smoking?</b>

379
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:36,810
<b>I just brushed it off that time,</b>

380
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:38,640
<b>but did something happen?</b>

381
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:41,940
<b>Actually, Da Kyung said...</b>

382
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:45,780
<b>she smelled cigarette smoke on him.</b>

383
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,520
<b>It was probably the internet cafe.</b>

384
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:51,250
<b>The smell gets on you if you're there for a while.</b>

385
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:57,960
<b>Maybe he doesn't feel at home in your house.</b>

386
00:33:58,430 --> 00:33:59,960
<b>He didn't do this when he lived with me.</b>

387
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,360
<b>The most he did...</b>

388
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,000
<b>was skipping his academy.</b>

389
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:06,970
<b>He seems like a completely different kid.</b>

390
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:08,870
<b>Are you saying he developed problems after he came to me?</b>

391
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:12,680
<b>I'm asking if something happened that I don't know about.</b>

392
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:15,510
<b>How would I know when he won't talk?</b>

393
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,930
<b>What is it?</b>

394
00:34:31,930 --> 00:34:32,930
<b>It's Do Chul.</b>

395
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:36,300
<b>Hae Kang is in the hospital.</b>

396
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:37,900
<b>They're going to get his medical record...</b>

397
00:34:38,430 --> 00:34:40,240
<b>and request a school violence hearing.</b>

398
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,610
<b>What should we do?</b>

399
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:08,260
<b>Of course, I should know.</b>

400
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:12,170
<b>How's Hae Kang doing?</b>

401
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,610
<b>You must have been scared.</b>

402
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:21,240
<b>Anyway, thank you for calling me, madam.</b>

403
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,080
<b>Yes.</b>

404
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,610
<b>Okay, bye.</b>

405
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:30,090
<b>(Councilman Cha's Wife)</b>

406
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,200
<b>You're home late.</b>

407
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,300
<b>I scolded him for fighting with a friend, that's why.</b>

408
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,910
<b>I heard he hit Hae Kang.</b>

409
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,650
<b>I need to meet with his parents and talk to them.</b>

410
00:35:58,010 --> 00:36:00,280
<b>Don't worry. I'll handle it.</b>

411
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,390
<b>Your stepping in and reconciling with them...</b>

412
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:05,390
<b>won't solve the problem.</b>

413
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:08,020
<b>Avoiding the school violence hearing isn't enough.</b>

414
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,660
<b>What about his stealing?</b>

415
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:13,300
<b>Does he even repent and admit what he did was wrong?</b>

416
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:16,330
<b>So? What do you want to do?</b>

417
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,930
<b>Do you want to punish him?</b>

418
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:19,400
<b>I'm sure it'll hurt right now,</b>

419
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:23,410
<b>but it may be better for Joon Young to receive proper punishment.</b>

420
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:25,840
<b>- Don't you agree? - He's going through puberty.</b>

421
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,540
<b>Everyone makes a mistake like that at his age.</b>

422
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:30,550
<b>It's not like he committed a serious crime.</b>

423
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:33,820
<b>I'm trying to talk some sense into him.</b>

424
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:36,520
<b>He's repenting plenty.</b>

425
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:42,720
<b>Do you really think this is just a teenage rebellion?</b>

426
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:49,060
<b>As long as things like this don't happen again, right?</b>

427
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:28,200
<b>How's Hae Kang?</b>

428
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:32,140
<b>May I see him and see how bad the injury is?</b>

429
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:33,740
<b>What good will it do if you see him?</b>

430
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:38,750
<b>I want to apologize to him first.</b>

431
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:40,120
<b>And to you too.</b>

432
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,650
<b>I'm very sorry.</b>

433
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:49,020
<b>You must think it was just a scuffle among kids...</b>

434
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:52,390
<b>that can be swept under the rug by the adults.</b>

435
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:55,630
<b>I'll bring Joon Young soon to apologize.</b>

436
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:59,900
<b>I thought it was only right that I apologize first.</b>

437
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,100
<b>I'm very sorry.</b>

438
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:03,770
<b>You.</b>

439
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:07,880
<b>Do you think I'm using the situation with the kids...</b>

440
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,780
<b>for personal reasons?</b>

441
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:11,480
<b>What do you take me for?</b>

442
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:13,320
<b>That is not what I mean.</b>

443
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:17,020
<b>My child did something heinously wrong,</b>

444
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:20,560
<b>and Hae Kang was hurt.</b>

445
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,890
<b>I know nothing can compensate you,</b>

446
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,990
<b>but I'll pay the medical bills...</b>

447
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:28,430
<b>and as much compensation as you want.</b>

448
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:29,870
<b>That's only proper.</b>

449
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:33,800
<b>Do you think I'm a beggar? I'm so annoyed.</b>

450
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:40,280
<b>They were close since childhood. I don't know how this happened.</b>

451
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,880
<b>It breaks my heart.</b>

452
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:46,920
<b>Madam.</b>

453
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,820
<b>Please find it in your heart to forgive Joon Young.</b>

454
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:53,360
<b>This will never happen again.</b>

455
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:55,990
<b>You know...</b>

456
00:38:58,090 --> 00:38:59,630
<b>he's not like that.</b>

457
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,930
<b>"He's not like that"?</b>

458
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,100
<b>Sure.</b>

459
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:09,240
<b>There are parents who mistakenly think they know their kids.</b>

460
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:13,440
<b>Did he tell you why he hit him?</b>

461
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:18,610
<b>My son was worried about your son and gave him some advice.</b>

462
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:20,920
<b>That was why he hit him.</b>

463
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:22,420
<b>Yes,</b>

464
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:24,390
<b>I heard.</b>

465
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,220
<b>It's my fault. I taught him wrong.</b>

466
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:31,290
<b>Like teaching him would have any effect.</b>

467
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:36,370
<b>You don't think this was the first time he stole, do you?</b>

468
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,170
<b>I heard things kept going missing from inside the classroom.</b>

469
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:41,340
<b>Did you know that?</b>

470
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,740
<b>You're a doctor, so you should know.</b>

471
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:46,280
<b>Kleptomania requires treatment.</b>

472
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:49,180
<b>Shouldn't you take him to the hospital?</b>

473
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:53,380
<b>Do you have proof?</b>

474
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:56,490
<b>All the kids in the class suspect Joon Young.</b>

475
00:39:57,190 --> 00:40:00,690
<b>Actually, from what I can tell, I think they're convinced it's him.</b>

476
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:04,730
<b>How do you know so little about your son, Dr. Ji?</b>

477
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:07,160
<b>I officially apologize for him hitting Hae Kang,</b>

478
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:09,800
<b>but don't accuse him of things he did not do.</b>

479
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:13,040
<b>We won't condone that either.</b>

480
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,240
<b>And if you don't?</b>

481
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:16,240
<b>What will you do?</b>

482
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,140
<b>What are you going to do about it?</b>

483
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,680
<b>You're here to apologize, and you're threatening me?</b>

484
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:23,950
<b>Don't even dream about settling.</b>

485
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:26,780
<b>We'll follow the directions of the School Violence Committee,</b>

486
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:28,950
<b>so you and your son...</b>

487
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:32,520
<b>better be ready for it.</b>

488
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:23,230
<b>You don't think this was the first time he stole, do you?</b>

489
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:27,070
<b>How do you know so little about your son, Dr. Ji?</b>

490
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:29,970
<b>Are you feeling sick?</b>

491
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:35,040
<b>I'll register you for just English and math, okay?</b>

492
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,480
<b>Good night, son.</b>

493
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:42,350
<b>What about me?</b>

494
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:45,890
<b>Why do I have to live like this?</b>

495
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:51,890
<b>It's not like I did anything wrong.</b>

496
00:43:04,810 --> 00:43:05,940
<b>I'm sorry?</b>

497
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:09,480
<b>What did you just say?</b>

498
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:14,050
<b>It doesn't cost that much for a bag of chips.</b>

499
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,620
<b>You don't have to worry about compensating me.</b>

500
00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:20,660
<b>But you should guide him well so he doesn't sleep out.</b>

501
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:23,960
<b>I understand earning money is important,</b>

502
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:26,090
<b>but I'm a parent too.</b>

503
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:29,630
<b>I kick out all underaged kids when it turns 10pm.</b>

504
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:32,630
<b>I think my employee forgot about it that day.</b>

505
00:43:33,370 --> 00:43:35,470
<b>Your son rushed out in the morning.</b>

506
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,310
<b>Hey kid.</b>

507
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:42,140
<b>Your father came here with you to apologize,</b>

508
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,380
<b>so you should live well.</b>

509
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:47,820
<b>Also, don't forget I have security cameras here.</b>

510
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,220
<b>Gosh.</b>

511
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:52,590
<b>I'm really sorry.</b>

512
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,860
<b>Was it that day when we saw you come in the morning?</b>

513
00:43:58,390 --> 00:43:59,930
<b>You didn't step out for a moment.</b>

514
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:02,200
<b>Were you there all night?</b>

515
00:44:02,930 --> 00:44:04,200
<b>I fell asleep.</b>

516
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:06,800
<b>I didn't do it on purpose.</b>

517
00:44:07,870 --> 00:44:11,370
<b>Why did you go out so late without saying a thing?</b>

518
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,450
<b>I heard you...</b>

519
00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:21,650
<b>talking about sending me abroad to study.</b>

520
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,120
<b>I left because I didn't want to hear it.</b>

521
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:26,420
<b>I didn't want to be home.</b>

522
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:31,030
<b>I won't send you abroad if you don't want to go.</b>

523
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,530
<b>I don't want to send you far away either.</b>

524
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:37,770
<b>Da Kyung didn't mean anything by it.</b>

525
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:41,540
<b>She only said that for your benefit, so don't be offended.</b>

526
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:45,210
<b>Let's not...</b>

527
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:50,650
<b>tell Mom about this. It'll make her worry.</b>

528
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:56,790
<b>Are you worried Mom would worry?</b>

529
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:02,190
<b>Why did you hit Mom back then?</b>

530
00:45:05,090 --> 00:45:06,730
<b>It's over already.</b>

531
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:09,330
<b>You two saw each other's bitter ends.</b>

532
00:45:10,770 --> 00:45:12,530
<b>Why are you seeing her again now?</b>

533
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:14,240
<b>Why are you living such a complicated life?</b>

534
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,710
<b>Aren't you two strangers since you got a divorce?</b>

535
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:20,880
<b>Although we got divorced,</b>

536
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:24,980
<b>you're still our son.</b>

537
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:29,250
<b>A couple can part ways, but not a parent and a child.</b>

538
00:45:32,390 --> 00:45:33,960
<b>It must be the toughest on you,</b>

539
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:38,430
<b>but it's your mom and dad who love you the most.</b>

540
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:40,830
<b>Are you making me an excuse again?</b>

541
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,870
<b>Don't you think it's cowardice?</b>

542
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:54,210
<b>What I initially saw in Joon Young was hatred.</b>

543
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:57,910
<b>He was scratching Chairman Yeo's car.</b>

544
00:45:59,410 --> 00:46:03,220
<b>This whole thing started...</b>

545
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:07,690
<b>because of the divorce, right?</b>

546
00:46:07,790 --> 00:46:11,060
<b>It won't be helpful to try and find an answer from the past.</b>

547
00:46:11,830 --> 00:46:15,300
<b>If you want to fix it, it's best to look at the present.</b>

548
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:25,770
<b>The date for the school violence hearing has been set.</b>

549
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,910
<b>It'd be best if you could settle before then.</b>

550
00:46:29,510 --> 00:46:32,050
<b>Have you met with Hae Kang's family?</b>

551
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:10,410
<b>Don't be late tomorrow to see Hae Kang at the hospital.</b>

552
00:48:44,850 --> 00:48:47,820
<b>Hello, madam. It's me, Yeo Da Kyung.</b>

553
00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:51,620
<b>How's Hae Kang doing?</b>

554
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:55,160
<b>I'm glad to hear that.</b>

555
00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:57,930
<b>Yes.</b>

556
00:48:58,860 --> 00:49:00,530
<b>I called because of that.</b>

557
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,500
<b>Maybe you should stay outside.</b>

558
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:20,440
<b>You don't have a great relationship with Hae Kang's mother.</b>

559
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,970
<b>That's why I should be the one to solve this.</b>

560
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:35,180
<b>Don't worry, Joon Young.</b>

561
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:38,350
<b>I'll take care of this, okay?</b>

562
00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:01,580
<b>We're here.</b>

563
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:11,050
<b>Thanks for making time for us.</b>

564
00:50:18,830 --> 00:50:19,990
<b>Sorry, Do Chul.</b>

565
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:23,060
<b>I should've taught him better.</b>

566
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:28,470
<b>It's normal for boys to fight sometimes.</b>

567
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:29,870
<b>Honey.</b>

568
00:50:31,610 --> 00:50:34,140
<b>The doctor told us he could've fractured his facial bone.</b>

569
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:35,580
<b>How could you take it so lightly?</b>

570
00:50:35,810 --> 00:50:37,180
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

571
00:50:39,910 --> 00:50:42,280
<b>I'll teach Joon Young well and make sure...</b>

572
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:44,720
<b>he doesn't do this again.</b>

573
00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:48,190
<b>I hope so.</b>

574
00:50:48,690 --> 00:50:52,590
<b>I'm very worried about him as a fellow parent.</b>

575
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:55,600
<b>If people could turn better after a few scoldings,</b>

576
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,470
<b>judges and police officers...</b>

577
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:00,400
<b>wouldn't need to exist in this world.</b>

578
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:15,850
<b>I'm sorry, madam.</b>

579
00:51:17,350 --> 00:51:18,390
<b>Joon Young.</b>

580
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:21,320
<b>We'd like to hear what you think.</b>

581
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:36,800
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

582
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:39,270
<b>I won't hit you again.</b>

583
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:41,810
<b>Whatever.</b>

584
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:44,510
<b>I want you to apologize for treating me like a psycho.</b>

585
00:51:46,510 --> 00:51:48,020
<b>You were always a jerk,</b>

586
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:49,950
<b>but you weren't a loose cannon.</b>

587
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:53,050
<b>You never used to sleep outside...</b>

588
00:51:53,690 --> 00:51:55,090
<b>or steal stuff.</b>

589
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:14,410
<b>I told you to stop living that way and to live a proper life...</b>

590
00:52:14,410 --> 00:52:16,210
<b>because I was worried.</b>

591
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:19,410
<b>But you told me you never did any of that...</b>

592
00:52:20,310 --> 00:52:21,520
<b>and that I'm lying.</b>

593
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:23,620
<b>You treated me like an idiot.</b>

594
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,000
<b>Tell him you're sorry.</b>

595
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,640
<b>I guess he's not ready to sincerely apologize.</b>

596
00:52:46,970 --> 00:52:48,110
<b>You guys can go home.</b>

597
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:07,400
<b>I'm sorry, Hae Kang.</b>

598
00:53:10,470 --> 00:53:11,800
<b>Will you please forgive him...</b>

599
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:15,470
<b>for my sake?</b>

600
00:53:18,910 --> 00:53:20,680
<b>I'd also like to apologize...</b>

601
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:22,940
<b>to both you and your husband.</b>

602
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:26,180
<b>What are you doing? You're making us feel uncomfortable.</b>

603
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:27,780
<b>Please get up.</b>

604
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:29,120
<b>We'll make sure...</b>

605
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:32,250
<b>Joon Young doesn't do this again.</b>

606
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:37,790
<b>I apologize to you from the bottom of my heart.</b>

607
00:54:17,330 --> 00:54:18,800
<b>Hello, madam.</b>

608
00:54:19,830 --> 00:54:21,100
<b>Councilman Cha, you're here too.</b>

609
00:54:21,370 --> 00:54:23,270
<b>My goodness, Da Kyung.</b>

610
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:33,950
<b>Hae Kang seemed to like this.</b>

611
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:37,450
<b>You didn't have to come all the way here.</b>

612
00:54:37,890 --> 00:54:39,550
<b>You're too kind.</b>

613
00:54:39,990 --> 00:54:42,420
<b>It's nothing compared to how upset you must've felt.</b>

614
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:47,430
<b>Hae Kang.</b>

615
00:54:49,530 --> 00:54:51,570
<b>Did you talk with Joon Young?</b>

616
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:56,170
<b>I'm really sorry.</b>

617
00:55:12,990 --> 00:55:14,020
<b>Ms. Ji.</b>

618
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:16,390
<b>Will you please leave?</b>

619
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:20,290
<b>What are you doing? You're making things awkward for all of us.</b>

620
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:25,400
<b>People might think we made you kneel on the floor or something.</b>

621
00:55:27,770 --> 00:55:29,240
<b>Will you please leave already?</b>

622
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:20,520
<b>When people are really sorry,</b>

623
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,990
<b>they have trouble finding words to express themselves.</b>

624
00:56:24,890 --> 00:56:27,090
<b>Joon Young is very sorry about what he did to you.</b>

625
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:29,900
<b>Right, Joon Young?</b>

626
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:36,170
<b>I'm at fault for what happened.</b>

627
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:40,110
<b>I suggested that Joon Young should study abroad.</b>

628
00:56:40,710 --> 00:56:43,310
<b>But that must've upset him a lot.</b>

629
00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:46,950
<b>Joon Young got upset because of what I said.</b>

630
00:56:46,950 --> 00:56:48,780
<b>But if you even call a school violence hearing,</b>

631
00:56:50,690 --> 00:56:52,790
<b>I'd feel way too guilty about what I did to Joon Young.</b>

632
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:56,090
<b>It'll upset Tae Oh as well.</b>

633
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:01,530
<b>Please forgive Joon Young for my sake.</b>

634
00:57:01,930 --> 00:57:05,600
<b>Tae Oh and I will talk to him so that he doesn't do this again.</b>

635
00:57:05,970 --> 00:57:09,540
<b>Gosh, we never expected you to apologize like this.</b>

636
00:57:10,070 --> 00:57:12,710
<b>My parents are also very worried about Joon Young.</b>

637
00:57:13,370 --> 00:57:17,210
<b>And they're very concerned that you and your husband...</b>

638
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:19,180
<b>have to go through this.</b>

639
00:57:23,850 --> 00:57:25,420
<b>It was just a fight between kids.</b>

640
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:28,620
<b>You don't need to be so worried. We're friends.</b>

641
00:58:12,770 --> 00:58:15,470
<b>Thanks. We were able to sort things out thanks to you.</b>

642
00:58:21,510 --> 00:58:22,540
<b>Joon Young.</b>

643
00:58:23,510 --> 00:58:25,680
<b>I'm not that hard to talk to.</b>

644
00:58:26,450 --> 00:58:29,180
<b>So if anything bothers you, feel free to talk to me about it...</b>

645
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:31,220
<b>like a friend.</b>

646
00:58:32,850 --> 00:58:37,260
<b>We'll only feel comfortable if you feel comfortable.</b>

647
00:58:53,070 --> 00:58:55,680
<b>The test results will be out in about 2 to 3 days.</b>

648
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:56,710
<b>Okay.</b>

649
00:58:57,340 --> 00:58:58,980
<b>Go home safely.</b>

650
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:00,820
<b>- Okay, thank you. - No problem.</b>

651
00:59:07,350 --> 00:59:08,590
<b>How many more patients are there?</b>

652
00:59:09,890 --> 00:59:11,330
<b>Two more, sir.</b>

653
00:59:12,690 --> 00:59:14,930
<b>It must be tiring to treat patients since it's been quite a while.</b>

654
00:59:15,060 --> 00:59:16,630
<b>It's not that I'm tired.</b>

655
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:19,830
<b>I had important plans that I had to suddenly cancel.</b>

656
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:21,870
<b>That's why.</b>

657
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:24,540
<b>- Golf? - A hospital directors' gathering.</b>

658
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:25,740
<b>That's golf.</b>

659
00:59:27,210 --> 00:59:29,980
<b>When will Dr. Ji be back?</b>

660
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:31,950
<b>She's only out today.</b>

661
00:59:32,910 --> 00:59:35,280
<b>Her son's future is at stake. Be patient.</b>

662
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,580
<b>Did I say anything?</b>

663
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:39,450
<b>- Send in the next patient. - Yes, doctor.</b>

664
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:44,760
<b>You took the afternoon off.</b>

665
00:59:44,930 --> 00:59:46,260
<b>Why did you come in?</b>

666
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:50,500
<b>I'm sorry for causing you concern.</b>

667
00:59:51,070 --> 00:59:53,330
<b>I'll see the afternoon patients.</b>

668
00:59:53,730 --> 00:59:55,870
<b>Okay. You do that.</b>

669
01:00:00,270 --> 01:00:04,140
<b>Don't worry. I explained everything to Dr. Kong.</b>

670
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:07,720
<b>- Thanks. - I heard Da Kyung fixed it.</b>

671
01:00:08,850 --> 01:00:11,890
<b>You know Councilman Cha's wife is a big mouth.</b>

672
01:00:11,890 --> 01:00:13,650
<b>Everyone knows already.</b>

673
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:17,260
<b>Dr. Ji.</b>

674
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:20,130
<b>Can you see a patient right away?</b>

675
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:22,530
<b>Sure. Okay.</b>

676
01:00:23,030 --> 01:00:24,200
<b>Let's talk later.</b>

677
01:00:31,810 --> 01:00:33,140
<b>What do you think?</b>

678
01:00:35,980 --> 01:00:37,610
<b>When did the stomachache start?</b>

679
01:00:38,150 --> 01:00:39,550
<b>It started a while ago,</b>

680
01:00:39,550 --> 01:00:42,250
<b>but it has been getting worse recently.</b>

681
01:00:43,650 --> 01:00:45,690
<b>You said it feels like gas at times, right?</b>

682
01:00:47,150 --> 01:00:48,220
<b>Yes.</b>

683
01:00:48,220 --> 01:00:52,590
<b>Actually, I was diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome before.</b>

684
01:00:52,590 --> 01:00:54,090
<b>Do you think that's it?</b>

685
01:00:54,460 --> 01:00:56,400
<b>You get constipated and have diarrhea often.</b>

686
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:59,170
<b>It does look like irritable bowel syndrome.</b>

687
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:02,000
<b>I'll prescribe some medicine for now.</b>

688
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:03,940
<b>Come back if it doesn't improve.</b>

689
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:07,340
<b>- Any chance you're pregnant? - No.</b>

690
01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:10,610
<b>Although I am pretty irregular.</b>

691
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:13,950
<b>We're done. Pick up your prescription.</b>

692
01:01:13,950 --> 01:01:15,250
<b>Thank you.</b>

693
01:01:18,190 --> 01:01:20,150
<b>Don't just accept that your periods are irregular.</b>

694
01:01:20,150 --> 01:01:21,990
<b>You should see a gynecologist.</b>

695
01:01:22,420 --> 01:01:24,930
<b>Okay, I will. Thank you.</b>

696
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:31,830
<b>Doctor. We have several patients backed up.</b>

697
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,370
<b>Can you see patients after hours today?</b>

698
01:01:34,670 --> 01:01:36,770
<b>We'll tell some to come tomorrow if you're too tired.</b>

699
01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:39,770
<b>Sure. I'll make up for what I missed.</b>

700
01:01:40,510 --> 01:01:43,440
<b>- But give me 10 minutes. - Yes, doctor.</b>

701
01:01:55,660 --> 01:01:56,690
<b>Are you sure?</b>

702
01:01:56,890 --> 01:01:59,890
<b>Maybe you're mistaken.</b>

703
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:01,360
<b>I'm sure.</b>

704
01:02:02,730 --> 01:02:04,470
<b>I'm sure Sun Woo knows too.</b>

705
01:02:05,070 --> 01:02:08,370
<b>That's why she got on her knees in front of Councilman Cha's wife.</b>

706
01:02:09,270 --> 01:02:13,610
<b>I made sure Hae Kang's family won't say anything about it, but...</b>

707
01:02:14,710 --> 01:02:18,650
<b>I think we should keep a close eye on Joon Young.</b>

708
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:23,620
<b>I'm too ashamed...</b>

709
01:02:25,150 --> 01:02:26,850
<b>to face you.</b>

710
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:29,720
<b>I'll feel terrible if Joon Young goes down the wrong path.</b>

711
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:32,060
<b>I feel responsible too.</b>

712
01:02:33,630 --> 01:02:36,400
<b>He needs to grow up well so I can stand tall too.</b>

713
01:02:37,530 --> 01:02:38,700
<b>Don't you agree?</b>

714
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:45,270
<b>Thanks. But Da Kyung,</b>

715
01:02:47,310 --> 01:02:48,910
<b>let me be the one feeling guilty.</b>

716
01:02:49,210 --> 01:02:50,610
<b>Don't you feel guilty too.</b>

717
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:52,550
<b>I'll feel too bad...</b>

718
01:02:53,510 --> 01:02:54,950
<b>if you do.</b>

719
01:02:57,050 --> 01:02:59,790
<b>I was prepared for that much when we brought him here.</b>

720
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:04,660
<b>So trust me and let me handle everything regarding Joon Young.</b>

721
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:09,730
<b>Okay.</b>

722
01:03:11,430 --> 01:03:12,570
<b>Thanks.</b>

723
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:03,650
<b>- Here you go. - I'll take that, thank you.</b>

724
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:24,670
<b>I can't stand having my life so complicated and annoying.</b>

725
01:04:25,910 --> 01:04:27,980
<b>Everything will be simpler if you're gone.</b>

726
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:30,780
<b>That would be the best for Dad too.</b>

727
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:34,780
<b>You should leave.</b>

728
01:04:37,890 --> 01:04:39,150
<b>Go where you want.</b>

729
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:41,090
<b>I'm fine.</b>

<b>Aren't you leaving?</b>

733
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:31,270
<b>I should.</b>

734
01:05:35,610 --> 01:05:39,110
<b>It looks like Ye Rim and Je Hyuk are getting back together.</b>

735
01:05:39,780 --> 01:05:41,720
<b>He's being sincere.</b>

736
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:43,580
<b>He turned over a new leaf.</b>

737
01:05:44,650 --> 01:05:46,290
<b>I thought they would.</b>

738
01:05:46,950 --> 01:05:48,090
<b>That's good.</b>

739
01:05:50,860 --> 01:05:52,930
<b>- It's a good thing, right? - What about you?</b>

740
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:56,700
<b>What about me?</b>

741
01:05:56,700 --> 01:05:58,570
<b>You said you had something to tell us.</b>

742
01:05:59,670 --> 01:06:02,470
<b>Ye Rim seemed to know generally what it's about.</b>

<b>What is it?</b>

744

<b>I...</b>

<b>may leave Gosan.</b>

<b>What?</b>

747
01:06:16,650 --> 01:06:20,350
<b>I'll tell Dr. Kong when the time is right.</b>

748
01:06:20,550 --> 01:06:22,560
<b>I'll train my successor...</b>

<b>I'm not worried about that.</b>

<b>What about you?</b>

752
01:06:31,060 --> 01:06:32,970
<b>Can you be apart from Joon Young?</b>

753
01:06:40,770 --> 01:06:42,510
<b>That's what he wants.</b>

754
01:06:45,780 --> 01:06:46,950
<b>Why?</b>

755
01:06:49,450 --> 01:06:52,090
<b>I don't know why he's pushing me away.</b>

756
01:06:54,250 --> 01:06:56,690
<b>How did you feel when your parents got divorced?</b>

<b>I don't know.</b>

758

<b>I was angry at both of them.</b>

<b>I wondered why the adults were acting that way.</b>

<b>I was confused.</b>

761
01:07:14,910 --> 01:07:16,040
<b>The funny thing is,</b>

762
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:19,880
<b>if they didn't keep in touch, I got mad at that.</b>

763
01:07:20,410 --> 01:07:24,020
<b>But if they did once in a while, I'd get mad that they were in touch.</b>

764

01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:18,800
<b>How did you know?</b>

782
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:20,370
<b>Da Kyung told me.</b>

783
01:09:20,900 --> 01:09:22,600
<b>She spoke to Councilman Cha's wife.</b>

784
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:25,570
<b>Don't worry.</b>

785
01:09:27,170 --> 01:09:29,810
<b>- We'll take care of it well. - How will you take care of it?</b>

786
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:32,110
<b>We'll reason with him.</b>

787
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:36,680
<b>We hurt him a lot,</b>

788
01:09:39,250 --> 01:09:40,550
<b>so we should trust him and wait for him.</b>

789
01:09:40,850 --> 01:09:41,960
<b>Kleptomania...</b>

790
01:09:44,990 --> 01:09:46,890
<b>isn't something that simple.</b>

791
01:09:46,890 --> 01:09:49,230
<b>I know what you're nervous about,</b>

792
01:09:50,430 --> 01:09:51,700
<b>but just leave it to us now.</b>

793
01:09:52,570 --> 01:09:53,600
<b>I'll raise...</b>

794
01:09:54,230 --> 01:09:55,640
<b>Joon Young properly...</b>

795
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:58,240
<b>to become someone right and strong.</b>

796
01:09:59,870 --> 01:10:01,710
<b>I'll raise him to become...</b>

797
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:05,280
<b>someone happy.</b>

798
01:10:07,010 --> 01:10:08,980
<b>Are you confident you can raise him well without me?</b>

799
01:10:12,690 --> 01:10:13,690
<b>Yes.</b>

800
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:25,430
<b>What is that about Joon Young not going home for a night?</b>

801
01:10:26,330 --> 01:10:27,700
<b>Is it true what Hae Kang said?</b>

802
01:10:31,970 --> 01:10:33,140
<b>It was the day...</b>

803
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:36,040
<b>I was with you.</b>

804
01:10:44,220 --> 01:10:45,920
<b>Why is it so easy for you and Mom?</b>

805
01:10:47,390 --> 01:10:48,990
<b>Does apologizing make it forgivable?</b>

806
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:51,320
<b>Is that how it works for adults?</b>

807
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:52,890
<b>It's over already.</b>

808
01:10:53,290 --> 01:10:55,530
<b>You two saw each other's bitter ends.</b>

809
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,470
<b>Why are you seeing her again now?</b>

810
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,430
<b>Why are you living such a complicated life?</b>

811
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:02,340
<b>Aren't you two strangers since you got a divorce?</b>

812
01:11:02,340 --> 01:11:03,600
<b>Are you making me an excuse again?</b>

813
01:11:05,810 --> 01:11:07,570
<b>Don't you think it's cowardice?</b>

814
01:11:11,710 --> 01:11:12,750
<b>No way...</b>

815
01:11:16,250 --> 01:11:17,350
<b>Could he have...</b>

816
01:11:18,550 --> 01:11:20,320
<b>No, that's impossible.</b>

817
01:11:31,870 --> 01:11:33,330
<b>Where's Joon Young right now?</b>

818
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:38,300
<b>Go ahead. Didn't you say you have something to talk about?</b>

819
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:46,070
<b>About...</b>

820
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:49,540
<b>when you slept over at the internet cafe...</b>

821
01:12:50,910 --> 01:12:51,980
<b>What about it?</b>

822
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:55,250
<b>Did you...</b>

823
01:13:00,450 --> 01:13:02,120
<b>come to me that day?</b>

824
01:13:11,630 --> 01:13:12,670
<b>Did you?</b>

825
01:13:23,580 --> 01:13:24,610
<b>Yes.</b>

826
01:14:39,590 --> 01:14:42,290
<b>(A World of Married Couple)</b>

827
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:44,290
<b>Dr. Ji disappeared?</b>

828
01:14:44,290 --> 01:14:47,390
<b>You were hurt because of what the adults did.</b>

829
01:14:47,530 --> 01:14:49,830
<b>I'm responsible for half of it.</b>

830
01:14:49,830 --> 01:14:51,460
<b>Can't you give him some time?</b>

831
01:14:51,830 --> 01:14:53,170
<b>He needs some time to breathe.</b>

832
01:14:53,330 --> 01:14:55,200
<b>Let's trust him and wait.</b>

833
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:56,600
<b>Aren't you tired yet?</b>

834
01:14:56,970 --> 01:14:59,210
<b>No, I'm happy.</b>

835
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:01,170
<b>We're really a family now.</b>

836
01:15:01,510 --> 01:15:03,040
<b>You know what I mean, don't you?</b>

837
01:15:03,210 --> 01:15:06,010
<b>What's making you so anxious?</b>

838
01:15:06,310 --> 01:15:08,180
<b>What I can't stand...</b>

839
01:15:08,580 --> 01:15:10,480
<b>is that my child hates me.</b>

840
01:15:10,820 --> 01:15:12,720
<b>Whether it's hatred or resentment,</b>

841
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:15,020
<b>you should respect Joon Young's feelings.</b>

842
01:15:15,090 --> 01:15:16,660
<b>Did something happen to Sun Woo?</b>

843
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:18,560
<b>I said, where's Sun Woo right now?</b>
