2
00:00:14,046 --> 00:00:15,916
(Episode 5)

3
00:01:23,776 --> 00:01:24,776
What was that?

4
00:01:24,776 --> 00:01:27,116
- Sir!
- What happened?

5
00:01:27,386 --> 00:01:29,056
What happened here?

6
00:01:29,386 --> 00:01:30,916
Did he get hurt?

7
00:01:31,317 --> 00:01:34,287
Mu Hyeok, stay right next to
Team Leader Dong.

8
00:01:35,026 --> 00:01:36,627
Chan Mi. Chan Mi!

9
00:01:37,026 --> 00:01:39,496
Try to make the bleeding stop
and call an ambulance.

10
00:01:39,496 --> 00:01:40,597
- Hurry!
- Okay.

11
00:01:40,696 --> 00:01:41,767
Chan Mi!

12
00:01:42,026 --> 00:01:44,666
Sir! Sir, wake up!

13
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:08,026
Stop right there! Hey!

14
00:02:08,386 --> 00:02:09,396
That's mine!

15
00:02:09,396 --> 00:02:11,226
Chan Mi! Chan Mi!

16
00:02:11,896 --> 00:02:13,567
- Go and start the car.
- Hey, wait.

17
00:02:14,097 --> 00:02:16,537
That's my motorcycle! That's mine!

18
00:03:13,587 --> 00:03:14,657
There she is.

19
00:03:15,356 --> 00:03:16,726
- It's her, right?
- Yes, it's her.

20
00:03:16,726 --> 00:03:17,726
Go faster!

21
00:03:22,226 --> 00:03:23,597
(68G 3877)

22
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:35,307
Gosh, she has a horrible temper.
She might break a leg.

23
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:58,097
Will you drive faster?
Why can't you pass those cars?

24
00:03:58,097 --> 00:04:00,437
- Step on it!
- Okay.

25
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:21,057
Oh, gosh. Careful. Turn the handle.

26
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:26,426
What the... Make a U-turn.

27
00:04:26,497 --> 00:04:28,097
That's prohibited here.

28
00:04:28,767 --> 00:04:30,366
Just make a U-turn.

29
00:04:30,366 --> 00:04:31,897
Just do it now!

30
00:04:41,976 --> 00:04:43,676
What are you doing?
You're unbelievable.

31
00:04:44,676 --> 00:04:48,647
(Wash and Clean)

32
00:04:48,647 --> 00:04:50,017
You're driving me crazy.

33
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:51,556
Move. I'll drive.

34
00:04:51,556 --> 00:04:53,257
- Move. Get out.
- No, I got it.

35
00:04:53,257 --> 00:04:54,957
My gosh, this is insane.

36
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:48,676
Where are they?

37
00:05:52,587 --> 00:05:53,986
There she is. That's her.

38
00:05:55,816 --> 00:05:57,717
- Stop her.
- What?

39
00:05:57,717 --> 00:05:58,787
Turn the handle!

40
00:06:05,056 --> 00:06:06,796
Oh, my gosh. What is she doing?

41
00:07:06,186 --> 00:07:07,257
What was that?

42
00:07:23,537 --> 00:07:25,577
Get out of there! Come here!

43
00:07:26,376 --> 00:07:28,347
- Chan Mi!
- Chan Mi!

44
00:07:29,007 --> 00:07:30,017
Chan Mi!

45
00:07:37,116 --> 00:07:39,626
Chan Mi, are you okay?

46
00:08:06,717 --> 00:08:08,647
What's going to happen
to our team leader?

47
00:08:10,517 --> 00:08:13,626
Finish getting your IV fluids.
Why are you getting up?

48
00:08:13,887 --> 00:08:16,056
I don't feel comfortable
lying down here...

49
00:08:16,056 --> 00:08:18,027
when she's sobbing her eyes out.

50
00:08:18,027 --> 00:08:20,397
He got shot because of me.

51
00:08:21,397 --> 00:08:23,537
I feel so sorry.

52
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:28,207
Hey, you can't even call that
a gunshot wound.

53
00:08:28,637 --> 00:08:31,876
What was the name of that brat
who shot me in Gwanghwamun?

54
00:08:31,876 --> 00:08:34,476
- Nitovenihaj.
- Yes, Nito...

55
00:08:35,007 --> 00:08:37,246
Well, whatever her name is,
when she shot me...

56
00:08:37,246 --> 00:08:39,447
right through my leg,
it almost killed me.

57
00:08:41,447 --> 00:08:42,657
Why are you still crying?

58
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:44,956
My gosh.

59
00:08:44,956 --> 00:08:46,186
What happened to her?

60
00:08:46,627 --> 00:08:48,727
- Are you okay?
- What did the doctor say?

61
00:08:48,727 --> 00:08:50,196
He didn't get directly shot at.

62
00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:52,397
The bullet slightly grazed off.

63
00:08:54,127 --> 00:08:55,596
What happened to her?

64
00:08:55,596 --> 00:08:56,836
Isn't it obvious?

65
00:08:57,497 --> 00:08:59,466
We caught her, of course.

66
00:09:01,306 --> 00:09:04,637
Chan Mi and Mi Soon, go back to HQ.

67
00:09:05,107 --> 00:09:07,446
Ye Eun, I want you to stay
with Kang Woo Won.

68
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:09,977
Keep an eye on him
until he wakes up.

69
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:11,546
Yes, sir.

70
00:09:16,757 --> 00:09:19,657
Find out what Chief Tak is after.

71
00:09:31,566 --> 00:09:34,336
She acts all tough,
but she's actually quite clumsy.

72
00:09:35,137 --> 00:09:37,007
Gosh, stop crying.

73
00:10:06,407 --> 00:10:08,166
(Ointment)

74
00:10:09,537 --> 00:10:10,977
You should've been more careful.

75
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:13,546
Scars never look pretty on a lady.

76
00:10:28,757 --> 00:10:29,997
Did you get injured?

77
00:10:31,127 --> 00:10:32,257
No, it's not a big deal.

78
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,777
(Good Casting)

79
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:46,076
Yes, sir.

80
00:10:49,206 --> 00:10:52,887
Koo Tae Rim definitely is involved
with the second transaction.

81
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:57,186
That's not what
Kang Woo Won's agency said.

82
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,426
They told me it was done
by an obsessive fan.

83
00:10:59,487 --> 00:11:01,787
Why would an obsessive fan
abduct one of our agents?

84
00:11:01,826 --> 00:11:02,897
Exactly.

85
00:11:03,326 --> 00:11:05,096
Why did she have to secretly
enter his house...

86
00:11:05,096 --> 00:11:06,426
and get herself in that mess?

87
00:11:06,426 --> 00:11:08,627
Since when did we have to report
every single thing...

88
00:11:08,627 --> 00:11:11,436
Kang Woo Won's agency
says they'll handle the press.

89
00:11:11,966 --> 00:11:13,367
So just hand this over
to the police and close the case.

90
00:11:13,367 --> 00:11:14,867
Then what about the gunshot?

91
00:11:14,867 --> 00:11:17,477
The bullet barely grazed off you.

92
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:19,777
Since when did we consider that
a gunshot wound?

93
00:11:19,777 --> 00:11:20,877
She was arrested at the scene.

94
00:11:21,607 --> 00:11:23,946
I won't release her until
the legal confinement hours are up.

95
00:11:24,346 --> 00:11:25,676
And I'll make sure she talks...

96
00:11:26,517 --> 00:11:28,346
within the given amount of time.

97
00:11:32,186 --> 00:11:33,426
My goodness.

98
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:36,796
He's putting up a fight.

99
00:11:48,737 --> 00:11:50,237
Trust the team and wait.

100
00:11:50,477 --> 00:11:53,546
We just have to find out
what the watch is.

101
00:11:54,407 --> 00:11:55,946
We'll interrogate her right away.

102
00:11:56,747 --> 00:11:58,076
You know there's no time.

103
00:11:58,277 --> 00:12:01,046
If Mi Soon is to make her
confess soon,

104
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,216
we need your help.

105
00:12:05,816 --> 00:12:06,926
She said...

106
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:10,757
she's looking for something.

107
00:12:11,157 --> 00:12:12,157
What?

108
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:16,466
I doubt you stole from us
without being prepared to die.

109
00:12:16,466 --> 00:12:17,537
Right?

110
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:21,706
The watch.

111
00:12:29,446 --> 00:12:30,647
Abducting people,

112
00:12:31,216 --> 00:12:34,946
wielding a knife,
and shooting someone.

113
00:12:35,117 --> 00:12:36,257
Too bad.

114
00:12:36,716 --> 00:12:38,916
You got it all wrong.

115
00:12:39,117 --> 00:12:40,287
What do you mean?

116
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:42,757
The man you were after...

117
00:12:43,627 --> 00:12:44,627
is Pi Cheol Woong.

118
00:12:45,497 --> 00:12:48,627
But the man you abducted
is Kang Woo Won.

119
00:12:50,096 --> 00:12:52,537
They might be
the same height and build,

120
00:12:52,537 --> 00:12:55,107
but how could you mistake
this face for this?

121
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,706
I just can't understand.

122
00:12:58,537 --> 00:13:00,346
Do you need glasses?

123
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:02,846
Your eyesight must be way low.

124
00:13:03,017 --> 00:13:04,676
You lost your target...

125
00:13:04,676 --> 00:13:06,787
and the thing you're after too.

126
00:13:07,517 --> 00:13:09,857
Don't say that
when you took the package.

127
00:13:10,117 --> 00:13:11,186
We did?

128
00:13:13,727 --> 00:13:16,227
You don't know yet, do you?

129
00:13:16,397 --> 00:13:18,127
That's why you're poking around.

130
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:29,436
You have 10 seconds.

131
00:13:30,336 --> 00:13:31,777
Tell me what it is.

132
00:13:37,977 --> 00:13:38,977
One,

133
00:13:40,316 --> 00:13:41,316
two,

134
00:13:42,546 --> 00:13:43,556
three,

135
00:13:44,487 --> 00:13:47,127
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,

136
00:13:47,127 --> 00:13:48,157
- 10.
- No.

137
00:13:48,357 --> 00:13:50,796
Wait. There's a chip inside.

138
00:13:52,796 --> 00:13:53,867
A chip?

139
00:13:56,466 --> 00:13:57,796
Really?

140
00:13:58,237 --> 00:14:00,166
There's something like that?

141
00:14:00,267 --> 00:14:04,076
I had no idea. That was very close.

142
00:14:05,176 --> 00:14:07,877
To summarize what we know,

143
00:14:08,046 --> 00:14:10,216
there are two identical watches.

144
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:13,387
The real one that
Kang Woo Won was wearing,

145
00:14:14,147 --> 00:14:17,416
and the fake replica
in which the chip was hidden.

146
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:19,926
I'm in possession of the item.

147
00:14:20,456 --> 00:14:23,296
The conclusion is that
the Pi Cheol Woong you're after...

148
00:14:23,296 --> 00:14:26,157
took the real watch
and chip and disappeared.

149
00:14:26,497 --> 00:14:28,627
That's why you tried to abduct him.

150
00:14:45,716 --> 00:14:47,346
Hand it over to me.

151
00:14:47,346 --> 00:14:49,416
It's okay now.

152
00:14:52,716 --> 00:14:53,826
Lady.

153
00:14:55,357 --> 00:14:57,027
The fool who took the chip.

154
00:14:57,027 --> 00:14:59,157
Don't you want to know where he is?

155
00:15:00,497 --> 00:15:02,926
That was embarrassing.

156
00:15:04,497 --> 00:15:05,936
Chief Tak.

157
00:15:06,096 --> 00:15:09,706
Do you think we couldn't get him
or didn't get him?

158
00:15:11,306 --> 00:15:14,176
We have all the evidence we need.

159
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:26,787
Is Baek Chan Mi over there?

160
00:15:30,456 --> 00:15:31,926
She knew about me?

161
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:37,966
Baek Chan Mi.

162
00:15:39,267 --> 00:15:42,537
Do you think I couldn't get you
or didn't get you?

163
00:16:01,757 --> 00:16:04,027

Woo Won.

167
00:16:43,296 --> 00:16:44,466
What happened?

168
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:47,166
Why did you suddenly pass out?

169
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:49,637
Why? Who did this to you?

170
00:16:49,737 --> 00:16:51,277
Who was it?

171
00:16:52,737 --> 00:16:53,777
It was...

172
00:16:53,777 --> 00:16:55,946
He has a packed schedule
starting tomorrow.

173
00:16:56,517 --> 00:16:59,747
You can't be here in bed like this!

174
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:02,117
It's not serious, is it?

175
00:17:02,117 --> 00:17:04,056
He can get up and walk, can't he?

176
00:17:04,686 --> 00:17:06,527
No, it's okay if he can't walk.

177
00:17:06,527 --> 00:17:08,987
I just need him to be breathing.

178
00:17:10,926 --> 00:17:12,727
I'm glad his nose is okay.

179
00:17:12,727 --> 00:17:15,767
It looks like he had a concussion.

180
00:17:15,767 --> 00:17:17,167
He can't work...

181
00:17:17,167 --> 00:17:19,136
He cracks open walnuts
with his forehead.

182
00:17:19,136 --> 00:17:20,366
What concussion?

183
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:23,207
He has events
and fan meets lined up.

184
00:17:23,507 --> 00:17:24,836
A full schedule.

185
00:17:25,237 --> 00:17:27,646
Do you know how much that's worth?

186
00:17:29,146 --> 00:17:31,576
The doctor.
Who's the doctor in charge?

187
00:17:31,777 --> 00:17:33,646
His doctor...

188
00:17:48,527 --> 00:17:51,796
Get well and get up soon, Mr. Kang.

189
00:18:04,747 --> 00:18:07,747
I sent you to kill a bug
and you came back with extra trash.

190
00:18:08,947 --> 00:18:10,616
I deserve to die for that.

191
00:18:16,856 --> 00:18:19,056
Did you see me give second chances?

192
00:18:19,967 --> 00:18:22,497
This is why cleaning
must be done on time.

193
00:18:23,366 --> 00:18:25,296
Whether it's a dog or a human,

194
00:18:25,296 --> 00:18:27,636
keeping it for too long
makes it harder to get rid of.

195
00:18:34,906 --> 00:18:36,777
You were saved,
so now you must repent.

196
00:18:39,247 --> 00:18:40,487
Get the item.

197
00:18:49,927 --> 00:18:50,927
It's me.

198
00:18:51,556 --> 00:18:54,427
It's been a while.
How about we meet for a meal?

199
00:19:01,037 --> 00:19:03,066
I will do as you say.

200
00:19:03,277 --> 00:19:05,507
I'll meet Director Myeong
if you want me to,

201
00:19:05,806 --> 00:19:08,346
and get rid of him
if that's what you want.

202
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:15,846
Do as you wish.

203
00:19:16,346 --> 00:19:18,017
I trust you.

204
00:19:18,886 --> 00:19:20,027
But...

205
00:19:20,586 --> 00:19:24,197
why do you need the files
from Yoon Seok Ho's computer?

206
00:19:24,656 --> 00:19:26,566
We took a look,

207
00:19:26,566 --> 00:19:29,227
but we found nothing suspicious.

208
00:19:29,697 --> 00:19:30,697
So...

209
00:19:30,697 --> 00:19:32,596
Do you know what
the opposite of "to doubt" is?

210
00:19:36,167 --> 00:19:37,507
It's not "to trust".

211
00:19:39,947 --> 00:19:41,406
It's "to know for sure".

212
00:19:48,517 --> 00:19:50,187
I think you got the wrong idea.

213
00:19:51,487 --> 00:19:54,126
You asked me to
look into Baek Chan Mi.

214
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:55,527
I checked.

215
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:58,326
She emigrated with her family...

216
00:19:58,856 --> 00:20:00,467
and hasn't returned.

217
00:20:02,697 --> 00:20:03,737
I see.

218
00:20:04,667 --> 00:20:06,667
Why did you want me to find her?

219
00:20:08,066 --> 00:20:09,406
Just in case.

220
00:20:11,406 --> 00:20:14,376
Your new secretary looks like her
and has a similar name,

221
00:20:14,806 --> 00:20:16,406
but they're definitely
different people.

222
00:20:16,406 --> 00:20:18,346
I knew she had left the country,

223
00:20:18,846 --> 00:20:20,116
but she could've returned.

224
00:20:20,116 --> 00:20:22,316
If she hasn't returned so far,

225
00:20:22,316 --> 00:20:24,257
maybe she has no plan to.

226
00:20:24,616 --> 00:20:26,987
By now,
she could've married a foreigner...

227
00:20:26,987 --> 00:20:28,687
and had a child too.

228
00:20:29,257 --> 00:20:30,856
There's an everlasting truth.

229
00:20:31,727 --> 00:20:33,927
Even if you see
your first love again,

230
00:20:33,927 --> 00:20:35,997
it will only get very ugly...

231
00:20:38,197 --> 00:20:40,606
The memories. They can be...

232
00:20:41,167 --> 00:20:42,967
amazingly fond.

233
00:20:46,806 --> 00:20:47,806
Memories.

234
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:13,707
Turn it off and sit down...

235
00:21:13,707 --> 00:21:15,437
before I throw a pen and hit you.

236
00:21:15,806 --> 00:21:17,906
Okay. Throw it.

237
00:21:18,376 --> 00:21:19,406
You have three seconds.

238
00:21:19,406 --> 00:21:21,406
Throw all you want.
I'll evade them all.

239
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:22,507
3, 2, 1!

240
00:21:22,806 --> 00:21:24,116
Gosh!

241
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:29,187
You could've hit me with that!

242
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:30,586
But I didn't.

243
00:21:30,586 --> 00:21:31,616
What's this?

244
00:21:31,917 --> 00:21:33,056
It ripped!

245
00:21:33,217 --> 00:21:34,427
It ripped!

246
00:21:34,586 --> 00:21:35,826
I can even fit my finger
inside the hole.

247
00:21:36,257 --> 00:21:37,856
That hole was already there.

248
00:21:37,856 --> 00:21:39,356
What are you talking about?

249
00:21:39,656 --> 00:21:42,096
How did you make a hole with a pen?

250
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,366
Stop overreacting. Take it off.

251
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:46,437
Gosh, no. Get off me.

252
00:21:46,437 --> 00:21:48,136
- Take it off.
- My gosh, what are you doing?

253
00:21:48,136 --> 00:21:50,406
- Take it off.
- Oh, my gosh! What the... Let go!

254
00:21:53,677 --> 00:21:54,876
You even know how to sew?

255
00:21:55,707 --> 00:21:57,846
I might not look like it,
but I'm a fine sewer.

256
00:21:57,846 --> 00:22:00,586
You just wait.
I'll fix this in no time.

257
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:12,396
There. It's all done.

258
00:22:15,366 --> 00:22:16,427
Look at that.

259
00:22:17,167 --> 00:22:18,267
Do you like it?

260
00:22:20,667 --> 00:22:21,737
How did you...

261
00:22:23,576 --> 00:22:24,636
What?

262
00:22:27,046 --> 00:22:28,507
Is this a rose of Sharon?

263
00:22:28,906 --> 00:22:30,747
How am I supposed to wear this?

264
00:22:30,747 --> 00:22:32,777
That took quite a lot of work.

265
00:22:32,777 --> 00:22:35,787
My gosh, get rid of this
and turn it back to normal.

266
00:22:35,787 --> 00:22:37,917
I can't go around
with this on my back.

267
00:22:38,017 --> 00:22:40,457
Why? It looks good on you.
It suits you well.

268
00:22:41,056 --> 00:22:43,497
Don't lie to me. I can't wear this.

269
00:22:43,656 --> 00:22:45,826
You shouldn't have turned on music
during class in the first place.

270
00:22:46,296 --> 00:22:48,326
I didn't know you'd do this.
I'm not going to wear this.

271
00:22:48,326 --> 00:22:49,427
Let's see what happens
if you take it off.

272
00:22:50,566 --> 00:22:52,336
But... I...

273
00:22:52,336 --> 00:22:53,336
Wear it.

274
00:22:55,267 --> 00:22:57,537
It looks good on you. It looks nice.

275
00:22:57,937 --> 00:23:00,007
You can't even
buy this stuff anywhere.

276
00:23:08,316 --> 00:23:09,417
Sir?

277
00:23:09,886 --> 00:23:10,957
Yes?

278
00:23:13,656 --> 00:23:16,757
- Aren't you going to leave?
- Right. I'll be off, sir.

279
00:23:48,257 --> 00:23:49,487
Are you awake?

280
00:23:51,427 --> 00:23:53,257
How do you feel? Do you feel better?

281
00:23:55,596 --> 00:23:57,396
Just a second.
I'll bring your doctor.

282
00:23:57,396 --> 00:23:58,497
Pi Cheol Woong.

283
00:24:03,777 --> 00:24:05,737
Where is Pi Cheol Woong,
and what are you doing here?

284
00:24:06,846 --> 00:24:09,247
- What?
- Why are you here instead?

285
00:24:10,046 --> 00:24:11,076
Where's my manager?

286
00:24:12,177 --> 00:24:13,546
Mr. Kang.

287
00:24:14,816 --> 00:24:16,217
Where am I?

288
00:24:26,257 --> 00:24:28,796
You don't remember
how you collapsed?

289
00:24:29,267 --> 00:24:32,037
No. What am I doing here?

290
00:24:32,967 --> 00:24:35,037
What are you doing?
Bring me my manager!

291
00:24:41,806 --> 00:24:44,447
- Hello? Hey, it's me.
- I don't think he remembers...

292
00:24:44,447 --> 00:24:45,677
anything that happened
during the past week.

293
00:24:45,977 --> 00:24:47,316
He lost his memory?

294
00:24:47,316 --> 00:24:50,116
- I'm at the hospital.
- Sometimes, people experience...

295
00:24:50,287 --> 00:24:53,086
short-term memory loss
after a concussion.

296
00:24:53,086 --> 00:24:55,787
I'll drive myself,
so bring me my car.

297
00:24:57,326 --> 00:24:59,896
Why is my car getting repaired?
My gosh.

298
00:25:00,896 --> 00:25:03,866
Will his memory never come back?

299
00:25:04,066 --> 00:25:07,306
We'll need to run some tests
and keep an eye on him.

300
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:08,937
But when people experience
memory loss,

301
00:25:08,937 --> 00:25:10,937
they sometimes become
extremely depressed...

302
00:25:10,937 --> 00:25:13,376
due to severe mental stress.

303
00:25:13,376 --> 00:25:15,507
What are you doing?
Bring me my clothes!

304
00:25:18,376 --> 00:25:20,517
But I don't think
you need to worry about that.

305
00:25:26,386 --> 00:25:29,187
Yes, we'll check
all the security cameras.

306
00:25:29,487 --> 00:25:31,596
Kang Woo Won might
get his memory back.

307
00:25:31,757 --> 00:25:33,257
So make sure
you keep an eye on him.

308
00:25:33,727 --> 00:25:36,027
And Pi Cheol Woong might
try to approach him, so be careful.

309
00:25:36,366 --> 00:25:37,396
Okay, bye.

310
00:25:39,467 --> 00:25:42,306
Gosh, will you stop? Go away.

311
00:25:43,237 --> 00:25:44,336
My goodness.

312
00:25:44,437 --> 00:25:47,207
I can't believe that thief
put you through this mess.

313
00:25:47,376 --> 00:25:48,876
Let's just be grateful
nothing worse happened.

314
00:25:49,177 --> 00:25:50,977
But it's such a relief
that he only took your watch.

315
00:25:50,977 --> 00:25:52,447
Don't you agree?

316
00:25:52,777 --> 00:25:54,886
If it weren't for her,

317
00:25:55,247 --> 00:25:56,616
you could've died.

318
00:26:01,126 --> 00:26:02,326
That watch was worth
100,000 dollars.

319
00:26:03,856 --> 00:26:07,027
You haven't forgotten
about tomorrow's event in Taiwan...

320
00:26:07,467 --> 00:26:08,866
regarding Il Kwang, have you?

321
00:26:08,866 --> 00:26:11,167
So are you saying...

322
00:26:11,167 --> 00:26:12,267
during the past week,

323
00:26:12,566 --> 00:26:14,667
which I have no recollection of,
I hired her...

324
00:26:14,866 --> 00:26:15,866
as an on-site staff?

325
00:26:16,707 --> 00:26:17,806
Really?

326
00:26:21,677 --> 00:26:24,116
Here. If you look here,

327
00:26:24,677 --> 00:26:27,187
you can see
that you signed the contract.

328
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:28,646
You see that, right?

329
00:26:30,457 --> 00:26:32,586
Call the person in charge
to confirm this.

330
00:26:32,616 --> 00:26:33,987
Okay, I'll do that.

331
00:26:36,187 --> 00:26:37,457
What's wrong with this?

332
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:38,896
(Commercial model contract)

333
00:26:40,697 --> 00:26:41,767
Well...

334
00:26:42,697 --> 00:26:44,336
Since I know there are no photos,

335
00:26:44,866 --> 00:26:46,336
I won't sign the contract.

336
00:26:54,177 --> 00:26:55,747
Your dog.

337
00:26:56,846 --> 00:26:58,717
Poppy ripped it apart.

338
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:00,747
Don't you remember?

339
00:27:04,886 --> 00:27:07,056
Oh, right.

340
00:27:09,957 --> 00:27:11,457
Hey, I just checked.

341
00:27:11,856 --> 00:27:14,267
Apparently, you called
Il Kwang yourself...

342
00:27:14,267 --> 00:27:17,296
and asked for Ms. Lim
in return for renewing the contract.

343
00:27:17,396 --> 00:27:18,796
They even have a recording
of the phone call.

344
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:22,066
The employee in charge
will be Lim Jung Eun.

345
00:27:22,136 --> 00:27:23,306
That's all.

346
00:27:32,576 --> 00:27:34,187
Mom!

347
00:27:35,586 --> 00:27:37,957
So Hui, do you want me
to carry you on my back?

348
00:27:38,257 --> 00:27:40,086
- Mom!
- No?

349
00:27:40,386 --> 00:27:42,826
Then how about an airplane?
Or how about a jet?

350
00:27:43,056 --> 00:27:44,527
Mom!

351
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:46,096
You don't want to do any of those?

352
00:27:46,457 --> 00:27:48,197
Gosh, you're driving me crazy.

353
00:27:49,396 --> 00:27:52,366
Hey, how can you sleep
in this situation?

354
00:27:52,537 --> 00:27:53,906
Mom!

355
00:27:55,336 --> 00:27:56,836
I stayed up all night last night.

356
00:27:57,076 --> 00:27:59,376
Shut it and make sure
the kid stops crying.

357
00:27:59,376 --> 00:28:00,906
- Mom!
- Okay?

358
00:28:02,376 --> 00:28:03,376
- Mom!
- My gosh.

359
00:28:04,046 --> 00:28:06,677
My goodness. There, there.
Let's go.

360
00:28:06,846 --> 00:28:09,187
Come on. Let's go.

361
00:28:10,987 --> 00:28:12,917
It's okay. There, there.

362
00:28:18,957 --> 00:28:19,997
My gosh.

363
00:28:20,227 --> 00:28:22,767
Ye Eun is very brave.

364
00:28:23,836 --> 00:28:25,967
How could she think of
having a baby on her own?

365
00:28:28,437 --> 00:28:30,977
I'm sorry. That was a bit rude,
wasn't it?

366
00:28:43,646 --> 00:28:44,987
They kind of look similar.

367
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:53,326
- Your mom's here. Let's go.
- So Hui.

368
00:28:55,027 --> 00:28:56,027
Hey, you're here.

369
00:28:56,467 --> 00:28:59,396
I'm sorry.
It must've been really tiring.

370
00:28:59,396 --> 00:29:02,066
No, that's not true. Just a little.

371
00:29:02,066 --> 00:29:03,406
She's very gentle.

372
00:29:04,136 --> 00:29:05,376
Gentle, my foot.

373
00:29:05,707 --> 00:29:07,777
Who does she take after?
She's such a fussy kid.

374
00:29:07,777 --> 00:29:09,646
She's nothing like her calm
and feminine mother.

375
00:29:11,017 --> 00:29:12,316
Maybe she takes after her dad.

376
00:29:12,447 --> 00:29:13,917
She looks just like him.

377
00:29:14,346 --> 00:29:16,687
Have you ever seen him?

378
00:29:16,687 --> 00:29:17,717
Yes.

379
00:29:17,886 --> 00:29:20,217
- I saw a photo...
- You must be starving.

380
00:29:20,727 --> 00:29:22,527
I'll fix you guys a meal.

381
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:23,787
No, don't bother.

382
00:29:24,796 --> 00:29:27,126
You stayed up all night
doing fieldwork.

383
00:29:27,126 --> 00:29:28,626
We can't make you cook as well.

384
00:29:28,626 --> 00:29:29,767
I'm not your mother-in-law.

385
00:29:30,296 --> 00:29:31,767
Come on. Let's go.

386
00:29:34,437 --> 00:29:36,737
I had a few snacks,
so I'm not hungry.

387
00:29:37,237 --> 00:29:38,906
- See you tomorrow.
- Thank you for today.

388
00:29:38,906 --> 00:29:39,906
No problem.

389
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:14,747
Something is off
about Min Seok's death.

390
00:30:15,846 --> 00:30:17,717
Didn't he die during a mission?

391
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:21,346
I overheard the higher-ups
talking about it earlier.

392
00:30:22,747 --> 00:30:24,217
And apparently,
everyone in Min Seok's team...

393
00:30:24,217 --> 00:30:26,086
is being investigated
by Internal Affairs.

394
00:30:26,156 --> 00:30:27,527
What does that mean?

395
00:30:27,927 --> 00:30:29,687
It means there's
something fishy going on.

396
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:43,406
I'm going to find out
no matter what.

397
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:46,737
If you died a wrongful death,

398
00:30:48,007 --> 00:30:50,106
I'm going to do everything I can
to reveal the truth.

399
00:30:57,417 --> 00:30:59,017
Mom, are you crying?

400
00:31:01,027 --> 00:31:02,356
No, I'm not crying.

401
00:31:05,126 --> 00:31:06,997
Don't worry. I'm not crying.

402
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:21,969
Isn't Ye Eun admirable though?

403
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:24,809
She had the baby first
without getting married...

404
00:31:24,809 --> 00:31:25,809
at a young age.

405
00:31:27,309 --> 00:31:28,410
What do you want to know?

406
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:30,440
She has no one
to take care of the baby though.

407
00:31:30,479 --> 00:31:31,549
Doesn't she have family?

408
00:31:31,979 --> 00:31:33,410
Or she severed ties with them.

409
00:31:33,779 --> 00:31:35,180
I wonder what her story is.

410
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:38,650
It'll be easier to find an agent
without a story to tell.

411
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,959
Do you perhaps have one too?

412
00:31:40,959 --> 00:31:43,319
I can be all ears all night long.

413
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,330
I'll see you around.

414
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:49,860
Why not talk some more over drinks?

415
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,400
Where are you going?

416
00:32:04,549 --> 00:32:06,209
I need a man of mine released.

417
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,019
I see you haven't changed a bit.

418
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:18,759
I'm no longer someone
you can order around...

419
00:32:18,759 --> 00:32:20,059
for free.

420
00:32:27,769 --> 00:32:29,769
You'll be satisfied
with what's in your trunk.

421
00:32:33,969 --> 00:32:37,709
You know very well that
chump change doesn't motivate me.

422
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:43,620
Don't tell me
you're aiming for the Chief of NIS?

423
00:32:46,989 --> 00:32:50,590
Would I be satisfied
with such a small position?

424
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:55,029
And I'm not one to be satisfied with
being Director at Il Kwang Hitech.

425
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,529
The higher you climb up the ladder,

426
00:32:58,529 --> 00:33:00,499
the more you'll need my money.

427
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:03,940
I don't believe
nor trust promises...

428
00:33:04,469 --> 00:33:05,910
that aren't tangible.

429
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:17,380
It's been a while.

430
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,090
Three years, right?

431
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:46,049
Pi Cheol Woong must not
leave the country.

432
00:33:46,049 --> 00:33:47,680
Check ships and flights
leaving our borders.

433
00:33:48,519 --> 00:33:50,950
We're in trouble if he leaves
the country with that chip.

434
00:33:51,319 --> 00:33:52,890
We should catch him before he does.

435
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:55,590
His photo has been distributed
all across the nation.

436
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:57,660
I want real-time updates
from the information center.

437
00:33:57,989 --> 00:33:59,029
Got it.

438
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:01,999
I'll call as soon as I spot
anything that looks like him.

439
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,630
Have you alerted airport security?

440
00:34:08,269 --> 00:34:09,269
Go ahead.

441
00:34:16,009 --> 00:34:17,279
Please take off your cap.

442
00:34:46,969 --> 00:34:48,140
We found him.

443
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:49,879
Put him on the big screen.

444
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,649
Rewind.

445
00:34:56,919 --> 00:34:58,020
Stop.

446
00:34:58,219 --> 00:35:00,089
Can you blow that up?

447
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:08,529
We have Pi Cheol Woong's location.

448
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:10,830
He's taking the 20:58 flight
serviced by Air Taiwan.

449
00:35:11,469 --> 00:35:14,469
If we leave now,
we might be able to catch him.

450
00:35:15,939 --> 00:35:18,469
Do we know where
Tak Sang Gi is headed?

451
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,509
There's no need to snoop around
for his whereabouts.

452
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,939
He's suddenly taking
a business to Taiwan.

453
00:35:24,379 --> 00:35:27,210
It seems like the two
will make contact in Taipei.

454
00:35:29,319 --> 00:35:30,580
You two, be on standby for now.

455
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:37,020
Why? Until when?

456
00:35:45,569 --> 00:35:47,430
What's going on? We're releasing her
to police custody...

457
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:48,739
when we're not done
investigating her?

458
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:51,669
Apparently, there's nothing
linking her to any particular crime.

459
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:52,910
She was caught at the scene.

460
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:54,410
Isn't that enough?

461
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:55,509
Chan Mi,

462
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:57,810
the gun was dusted for prints,
but only...

463
00:35:57,810 --> 00:35:59,350
Mr. Dong's were found.

464
00:36:00,009 --> 00:36:01,080
What?

465
00:36:01,919 --> 00:36:04,649
Your prints are all over
Kwon Min Seok's gun.

466
00:36:04,919 --> 00:36:06,549
You took it from him, shot him,

467
00:36:06,549 --> 00:36:08,259
and let the perp escape, didn't you?

468
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:12,529
What tipped the scale...

469
00:36:12,759 --> 00:36:15,730
was the fact that the victim
is suffering from memory loss.

470
00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:18,299
He can't testify as a witness.

471
00:36:21,129 --> 00:36:24,000
The agent died
while trying to apprehend the perp,

472
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:25,569
but you ran after him...

473
00:36:25,609 --> 00:36:27,410
only to lose him
even after firing at him.

474
00:36:29,279 --> 00:36:30,410
Could it be...

475
00:36:31,279 --> 00:36:32,480
that you let him go on purpose?

476
00:36:34,279 --> 00:36:36,580
How can it be confirmed
when the only witness...

477
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:37,750
is dead?

478
00:36:43,859 --> 00:36:44,960
Darn it.

479
00:36:45,629 --> 00:36:46,629
Hey.

480
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:48,399
Chan Mi!

481
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:54,839
Did you sign off on this?

482
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,540
I knew you were
too quiet these days.

483
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:00,609
Of course,
the Baek Chan Mi I know...

484
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,239
would barge in here.

485
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:03,439
Please take back...

486
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,379
this decision.

487
00:37:05,379 --> 00:37:07,509
I wouldn't have signed off on it
if I was going to.

488
00:37:07,509 --> 00:37:08,750
But Chief!

489
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:18,029
She's...

490
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:20,730
a material witness in this case.

491
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:22,730
She's also...

492
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:27,029
the only lead you have
regarding Michael.

493
00:37:27,169 --> 00:37:28,500
If we apprehend Michael,

494
00:37:28,969 --> 00:37:30,600
the leak within Il Kwang Hitech...

495
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,370
will also be revealed.

496
00:37:32,739 --> 00:37:34,210
That's what you said the last time.

497
00:37:35,509 --> 00:37:37,339
Once we apprehend Michael,

498
00:37:37,339 --> 00:37:40,210
we'll find the leak within Unixen.

499
00:37:40,279 --> 00:37:42,419
You're not
getting out of here alive!

500
00:37:46,189 --> 00:37:48,859
Do you need me to remind you
what happened?

501
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,660
Why did you even...

502
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,460
put me on this case?

503
00:37:57,730 --> 00:37:59,830
Do you know what makes us
different from animals?

504
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:02,799
Our intelligence?

505
00:38:03,569 --> 00:38:04,569
Our sensitivity?

506
00:38:05,339 --> 00:38:06,410
Our rationality?

507
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:08,239
No.

508
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,810
It's the fact that
we learn from our mistakes.

509
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:13,379
That's what makes us human.

510
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:18,850
It's about time
you broke free from your past.

511
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,290
Live your tomorrow...

512
00:38:22,419 --> 00:38:24,120
and envision your future.
Got it?

513
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:29,430
We have Pi Cheol Woong's location.

514
00:38:32,799 --> 00:38:35,399
You located Pi Cheol Woong?

515
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:38,540
A day.

516
00:38:39,439 --> 00:38:41,040
No, give me 20 hours.

517
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:43,939
I'll have him delivered by then.

518
00:38:53,819 --> 00:38:56,290
You want me to go
on a business trip?

519
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:59,129
"My Girlfriend Mrs. Kim"
starring Kang Woo Won...

520
00:38:59,129 --> 00:39:01,160
was a huge hit in South-East Asia.

521
00:39:01,529 --> 00:39:04,830
Considering the amount of money
we poured into his contract,

522
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:07,029
we should milk him any way we can.

523
00:39:07,029 --> 00:39:08,640
Don't you agree?

524
00:39:09,899 --> 00:39:12,270
But it's...

525
00:39:12,439 --> 00:39:15,580
I'm afraid this is
too sudden for me.

526
00:39:16,109 --> 00:39:17,779
The event was already scheduled.

527
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:20,410
Although, you going there...

528
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:23,250
was recently requested
by Kang Woo Won.

529
00:39:24,419 --> 00:39:26,620
If you're done complaining,
get going.

530
00:39:34,629 --> 00:39:35,759
(Il Kwang Cookbob Launching Event)

531
00:39:35,759 --> 00:39:37,899
Why launch a rice cooker in Taiwan?

532
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,129
Jung Eun.

533
00:39:40,469 --> 00:39:41,700
You're fluent in Mandarin, right?

534
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,239
I am?

535
00:39:44,339 --> 00:39:45,439
Since when?

536
00:39:45,439 --> 00:39:46,810
According to your resume,

537
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:48,279
you have a level-five on the HSK...

538
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:50,680
and can speak Mandarin
at a top level.

539
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:55,819
We made sure you'll get in,
so relax. Don't get intimidated.

540
00:39:57,149 --> 00:39:59,520
We won't bother hiring
a translator for him,

541
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,250
so be of good service.

542
00:40:02,089 --> 00:40:03,089
What?

543
00:40:35,489 --> 00:40:36,520
Are you hurt?

544
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,060
Are you all right?

545
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,160
Yes,

546
00:40:41,799 --> 00:40:43,200
I'm good.

547
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,029
Watch it, okay?

548
00:40:45,299 --> 00:40:47,500
This suitcase costs more
than your annual salary...

549
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:50,000
and you almost had it scratched.

550
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:51,839
The stairs are quite steep.

551
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:53,069
Carry it then.

552
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:57,310
I'm supposed to carry it
when it has wheels?

553
00:40:57,310 --> 00:40:58,350
See for yourself.

554
00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:00,750
There may be wheels,
but there's also a handle.

555
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,080
Why?

556
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:04,680
For it to be carried like so.

557
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:14,460
Unbelievable.

558
00:41:45,629 --> 00:41:46,759
What on earth are you doing?

559
00:41:46,759 --> 00:41:48,330
The suitcase is in your trunk.

560
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:50,060
You're ruining the leather!

561
00:41:51,399 --> 00:41:52,600
An Italian master artisan...

562
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,629
made this from
a 10-year processed cowhide.

563
00:41:54,899 --> 00:41:56,870
This blanket is to protect it
from fine dust,

564
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:58,569
so what'll happen if you sit on it?

565
00:41:58,910 --> 00:41:59,969
Then...

566
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:03,009
should I move to the back?

567
00:42:03,009 --> 00:42:04,080
The back is also...

568
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:08,319
Take a cab.

569
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,149
A cab?

570
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:13,419
You can take a deluxe cab.

571
00:42:17,089 --> 00:42:19,759
Don't you dare be late and make me
unload my suitcase myself.

572
00:42:24,259 --> 00:42:25,469
Move it!

573
00:42:27,669 --> 00:42:29,640
Unbelievable.

574
00:42:36,339 --> 00:42:37,540
Now I get it.

575
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,509
No wonder Pi Cheol Woong left him.

576
00:42:47,319 --> 00:42:49,219
(Wash and Clean)

577
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,060
It's been a while...

578
00:42:58,299 --> 00:42:59,399
since we went abroad.

579
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:02,399
I'd kill for a three-day vacation.

580
00:43:02,739 --> 00:43:04,939
You two.
This isn't a vacation, you know.

581
00:43:05,310 --> 00:43:07,410
Where's the discipline?
Did you bring the anti-nausea pill?

582
00:43:07,509 --> 00:43:08,779
I always carry some with me.

583
00:43:32,770 --> 00:43:33,930
I'm sorry.

584
00:43:34,969 --> 00:43:37,239
I paid the cab driver
double the fare,

585
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,210
but there was too much traffic.

586
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:43,009
What an idiot.

587
00:43:53,919 --> 00:43:55,919
- Woo Won!
- Woo Won!

588
00:43:58,359 --> 00:43:59,489
- My gosh.
- Goodness.

589
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:01,460
- Woo Won!
- Over here.

590
00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:04,460
- Dear gosh.
- Woo Won.

591
00:44:21,350 --> 00:44:22,779
- Woo Won!
- Woo Won!

592
00:44:22,779 --> 00:44:24,379
(Why do I hear my daughter's voice?)

593
00:44:24,379 --> 00:44:25,819
- Woo Won!
- Over here.

594
00:44:27,649 --> 00:44:31,060
Woo Won! Gosh, it's really him.

595
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:33,989
(Why do I hear my daughter's voice?)

596
00:44:35,299 --> 00:44:37,160
Hello and welcome aboard.

597
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:40,299
Hello and welcome aboard Air Taiwan.

598
00:44:40,299 --> 00:44:42,799
Please enjoy your flight.

599
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:44,439
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

600
00:44:44,439 --> 00:44:46,009
Welcome aboard Air Taiwan.

601
00:44:46,009 --> 00:44:47,169
Welcome.

602
00:44:48,910 --> 00:44:50,180
Welcome aboard.

603
00:44:52,379 --> 00:44:55,120
My gosh. This is incredible.

604
00:45:06,089 --> 00:45:07,160
What do you think you're doing?

605
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:11,060
- Sorry?
- You really think you're worthy...

606
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:12,969
of a 15,000-dollar
first-class ticket?

607
00:45:14,629 --> 00:45:16,870
Then where...

608
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:18,669
do I sit?

609
00:45:18,669 --> 00:45:20,009
Just think about it.

610
00:45:20,469 --> 00:45:23,239
Where do you think
you should be sitting?

611
00:45:26,410 --> 00:45:28,480
- Business class?
- Business class?

612
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:31,649
As if.

613
00:45:32,919 --> 00:45:34,250
You're flying in coach.

614
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:36,089
Get here in 10 seconds
when I call you.

615
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:37,689
Got it?

616
00:45:39,489 --> 00:45:40,529
Got it.

617
00:45:46,169 --> 00:45:48,200
My gosh. Are you all right?

618
00:45:56,980 --> 00:45:59,350
Yes, I'm fine. I'm all right.

619
00:46:01,149 --> 00:46:03,580
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm good.

620
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:04,819
Goodness.

621
00:46:04,819 --> 00:46:05,950
(Earpiece)

622
00:46:43,919 --> 00:46:44,989
Hey.

623
00:46:46,730 --> 00:46:47,930
How did you know it was me?

624
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:50,430
Only an idiot wouldn't know.

625
00:46:52,629 --> 00:46:55,939
Being in a disguise has
never been your strong suit.

626
00:47:07,009 --> 00:47:08,279
Let me know...

627
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:10,819
as soon as you spot Pi Cheol Woong.

628
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:18,390
Welcome, everyone.

629
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:22,029
We are happy
to have you with us today.

630
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:24,500
Our flight attendants will...

631
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:27,600
Pi Cheol Woong is nowhere
in business class.

632
00:47:28,839 --> 00:47:31,569
Please make sure
that electronic devices...

633
00:47:31,569 --> 00:47:34,239
are stored safely
in the overhead compartment.

634
00:47:35,439 --> 00:47:36,910
Here you go.

635
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:42,149
I'm a fan, Mr. Kang.

636
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:43,319
Right.

637
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:48,350
I'm sorry,
but could we take a photo?

638
00:47:50,259 --> 00:47:51,290
Right here.

639
00:47:54,759 --> 00:47:55,759
You!

640
00:47:56,430 --> 00:47:58,870
What did I say
about swatting the flies away?

641
00:47:59,569 --> 00:48:01,299
Get over here in 10 seconds.

642
00:48:02,770 --> 00:48:04,069
My gosh.

643
00:48:09,939 --> 00:48:11,710
I made a bad decision.

644
00:48:16,350 --> 00:48:17,549
There's a fly in here?

645
00:48:18,950 --> 00:48:20,089
It just flew away.

646
00:48:21,149 --> 00:48:23,390
Since you're here,
hand me the headset.

647
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,730
- The headset?
- Yes.

648
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:32,770
This blanket is too dirty.

649
00:48:32,770 --> 00:48:34,330
Get me my cardigan.

650
00:48:36,839 --> 00:48:37,899
My slippers.

651
00:48:53,049 --> 00:48:55,589
(Pistachio cookies made
from locally-grown wheat)

652
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:58,259
Kang Woo Won's allergies.

653
00:48:58,589 --> 00:48:59,790
(Kang Woo Won allergies)

654
00:48:59,790 --> 00:49:02,000
He's allergic to peanuts?

655
00:49:06,069 --> 00:49:07,100
No way.

656
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:11,040
He couldn't have eaten
this pistachio cookie.

657
00:49:21,049 --> 00:49:24,120
Pi Cheol Woong isn't
in first class either.

658
00:49:29,689 --> 00:49:31,359
Then he's flying coach.

659
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:33,759
I'll look for him.

660
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:45,839
Ladies and gentlemen,

661
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:48,469
we are now taking off.

662
00:49:49,109 --> 00:49:51,239
Please fasten your seat belts.

663
00:49:52,450 --> 00:49:54,710
All areas including
the lavatories...

664
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:19,540
Darn it.

665
00:50:21,009 --> 00:50:23,410
You being here must mean
that you're stressed out.

666
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:26,279
Isn't it obvious?

667
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:33,549
Doesn't this add to the stress?

668
00:50:35,759 --> 00:50:36,790
(Semicon Event List of Attendees)

669
00:50:37,489 --> 00:50:39,390
The list of attendees
for the Semicon Event?

670
00:50:40,359 --> 00:50:41,989
It's odd how Mr. Tak...

671
00:50:41,989 --> 00:50:43,759
is among the list of attendees.

672
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,669
What's weirder is that...

673
00:50:45,899 --> 00:50:48,299
he's flying in to Taipei
but flying out of Kaohsiung.

674
00:50:51,339 --> 00:50:53,710
As soon as Mr. Ok
moved up the development schedule,

675
00:50:53,710 --> 00:50:55,810
Mr. Tak pretends to go to Taipei...

676
00:50:55,810 --> 00:50:57,939
when he's actually
heading to Kaohsiung.

677
00:50:58,279 --> 00:50:59,950
He's there to conduct...

678
00:50:59,950 --> 00:51:01,480
some other business.

679
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:06,149
I can't believe
you missed every shot.

680
00:51:07,319 --> 00:51:08,589
It looks easy, right?

681
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:11,060
But it's hard to even
land 1 out of 100.

682
00:51:11,219 --> 00:51:12,529
1 out of 100?

683
00:51:16,330 --> 00:51:18,830
Remember the plant manager
who was fired...

684
00:51:18,899 --> 00:51:21,469
when Director Myeong
gave the job to a man of his?

685
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:22,870
The branch manager in Malaysia?

686
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,239
Have him be our eyes.

687
00:51:24,770 --> 00:51:27,140
I want to know who Mr. Tak meets
and for what reason.

688
00:51:27,339 --> 00:51:28,810
We might not
find out everything,

689
00:51:28,810 --> 00:51:30,310
but it could at least
lead to something.

690
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,080
Did you see that?

691
00:51:37,850 --> 00:51:40,549
You finally hit one
after spending 250 dollars.

692
00:51:40,549 --> 00:51:42,819
I may get even better at this...

693
00:51:43,890 --> 00:51:45,560
if I spend double that money.

694
00:51:49,259 --> 00:51:51,029
Why not just
buy the game for himself?

695
00:51:51,830 --> 00:51:53,069
Is this out of order or something?

696
00:51:59,609 --> 00:52:01,270
It's perfectly fine.

697
00:52:25,930 --> 00:52:29,239
The seat belt sign
has been turned off.

698
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:32,710
However, we do recommend
that you keep it on when seated...

699
00:52:32,710 --> 00:52:35,810
in case of sudden movements
due to turbulence.

700
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,609
When the seat belt sign is on,

701
00:52:38,609 --> 00:52:40,080
please understand
that other services...

702
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:41,980
may be limited due to your safety.

703
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:46,390
Cell phones
and extra battery packs...

704
00:52:46,390 --> 00:52:47,819
could burn and cause a fire.

705
00:52:48,390 --> 00:52:50,290
Please make sure...

706
00:52:50,290 --> 00:52:54,060
that you have yours with you
or know where yours is at all times.

707
00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:08,839
Pi Cheol Woong will be...

708
00:53:08,910 --> 00:53:11,310
on a flight
that departs in two hours.

709
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,710
Mr. Tak is on the plane.

710
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:53,520
What on earth? Is there no signal?

711
00:53:57,919 --> 00:54:00,430
He's not in section A.
Check Section B.

712
00:54:02,330 --> 00:54:03,399
Anybody?

713
00:54:26,189 --> 00:54:29,689
Ladies and gentlemen,
we will soon arrive in Taipei.

714
00:54:30,589 --> 00:54:32,430
- Hurry up.
- Please fasten your seat belts...

715
00:54:32,430 --> 00:54:33,629
for your own safety.

716
00:54:33,859 --> 00:54:36,129
We will soon arrive
at our destination.

717
00:54:36,129 --> 00:54:37,700
Return your seat
to an upright position,

718
00:54:37,730 --> 00:54:38,759
stow your tray table,

719
00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:40,370
and fasten your seat belt.

720
00:54:41,270 --> 00:54:43,839
Ladies and gentlemen,
we will be landing shortly.

721
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:45,910
Please make sure
that your seat belt is fastened...

722
00:54:45,939 --> 00:54:47,310
and your seat back...

723
00:54:47,310 --> 00:54:50,609
is in the upright position
and your tray table is closed.

724
00:54:50,710 --> 00:54:53,080
Mr. Tak is on the plane.

725
00:55:01,219 --> 00:55:03,719
I'm sorry, sir,
but could you return to your seat?

726
00:55:29,549 --> 00:55:30,680
Are you all right?

727
00:55:33,489 --> 00:55:34,790
I need to use the toilet.

728
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:41,930
Sir, please take your seat.

729
00:55:41,989 --> 00:55:44,299
Sir? Please return to your seat.

730
00:55:46,230 --> 00:55:47,500
Handle the flight attendants.

731
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:49,600
Okay.

732
00:55:51,969 --> 00:55:53,669
Sir, please return to your seat.

733
00:55:53,770 --> 00:55:54,870
But I really need to go.

734
00:55:54,870 --> 00:55:56,480
You can use the lavatory
after we land.

735
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:57,810
But I really need to go.

736
00:55:57,810 --> 00:55:59,149
Please return to your seat.

737
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:01,710
- I'm about to burst, you jerk!
- Sir!

738
00:56:01,779 --> 00:56:03,620
- Sir!
- Sir?

739
00:56:03,850 --> 00:56:05,080
Sir, please return to your seat.

740
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:07,149
I know that,
but I really need to go.

741
00:56:07,149 --> 00:56:08,890
It can't wait.

742
00:56:08,890 --> 00:56:11,160
- Please return to your seat.
- We appreciate your cooperation.

743
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:17,029
- Move!
- But sir!

744
00:57:11,219 --> 00:57:14,020
Why didn't you say anything
after finding out who I was?

745
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:19,689
It's you, isn't it? You're Michael.

746
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,040
My gosh.

747
00:57:31,569 --> 00:57:32,739
Oh, dear.

748
00:57:35,569 --> 00:57:37,180
He wet himself.

749
00:57:48,850 --> 00:57:50,259
I hear something back there.

750
00:57:50,259 --> 00:57:52,060
A passenger is relieving herself.

751
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:53,560
But I should check.

752
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:55,029
Check on a passenger peeing?

753
00:57:55,029 --> 00:57:56,129
But...

754
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:03,370
In one blow?

755
00:58:04,339 --> 00:58:05,969
That's what I call talent.

756
00:58:06,069 --> 00:58:07,710
I've never done that
to a person before.

757
00:58:39,710 --> 00:58:42,640
Are you all right, young man?
Why are you on the floor?

758
00:58:42,910 --> 00:58:44,540
Mind your own business.

759
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:50,919
A good night's sleep
will make you feel...

760
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:52,719
as good as new.

761
00:59:00,529 --> 00:59:01,689
Package acquired.

762
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:07,899
No, this way.

763
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:04,859
(Epilogue)

764
01:00:12,799 --> 01:00:13,870
Yes, Mr. Yoon.

765
01:00:14,370 --> 01:00:16,669
Could I perhaps...

766
01:00:16,969 --> 01:00:19,370
ask a personal favor?

767
01:00:19,370 --> 01:00:21,169
A personal favor?

768
01:00:23,009 --> 01:00:24,310
Go ahead.

769
01:00:25,410 --> 01:00:26,480
Well,

770
01:00:28,210 --> 01:00:29,549
do you have a needle and thread?

771
01:00:30,719 --> 01:00:31,850
A needle and thread?

772
01:00:35,089 --> 01:00:39,189
You didn't have to do it for me,
you know.

773
01:00:39,189 --> 01:00:40,989
No, it's all right.

774
01:00:41,290 --> 01:00:42,290
Just so you know,

775
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,500
I'm a fine sewer.

776
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:46,669
I see.

777
01:00:47,669 --> 01:00:50,839
Someone I knew
was also a fine sewer.

778
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:52,439
Did I mention...

779
01:00:52,569 --> 01:00:56,140
that you look a lot like her?

780
01:00:57,779 --> 01:01:00,779
A lot of people in this world
look alike.

781
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:03,180
I guess you're right,

782
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:05,879
but I first thought
that you were her.

783
01:01:06,189 --> 01:01:08,020
The difference in name and age...

784
01:01:09,049 --> 01:01:11,859
made me wonder if you were twins.

785
01:01:11,859 --> 01:01:15,930
If you knew her a long time ago,

786
01:01:16,359 --> 01:01:18,230
she could look
completely different now.

787
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:21,830
You're right. 15 years have passed,

788
01:01:21,830 --> 01:01:24,040
so she'll be 38 now.

789
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:26,540
She's probably a wife and a mom.

790
01:01:29,779 --> 01:01:30,810
I'm not sure.

791
01:01:31,109 --> 01:01:33,450
I don't think
it's right to assume...

792
01:01:33,710 --> 01:01:36,080
that women at the age of 38...

793
01:01:36,419 --> 01:01:38,049
are all wives...

794
01:01:38,049 --> 01:01:40,020
and mothers.

795
01:01:40,020 --> 01:01:42,149
Gosh, I didn't mean it like that.

796
01:01:42,149 --> 01:01:43,460
She was just very popular...

797
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:45,460
and also had a series of boyfriends.

798
01:01:46,489 --> 01:01:49,859
Are you saying that
she had a messy dating life?

799
01:01:50,759 --> 01:01:53,830
Why are you getting upset
about this though?

800
01:01:56,799 --> 01:01:58,370
It makes me uncomfortable...

801
01:01:58,370 --> 01:02:01,069
to hear you talk about her
behind her back.

802
01:02:02,469 --> 01:02:03,879
I guess I understand.

803
01:02:05,879 --> 01:02:07,080
To be honest,

804
01:02:07,580 --> 01:02:10,779
I thought that you were her
and that you lied about...

805
01:02:10,779 --> 01:02:11,919
your age and name...

806
01:02:11,919 --> 01:02:13,390
- on your resume.
- Gosh, that stings.

807
01:02:13,390 --> 01:02:15,089
Why? What is it?

808
01:02:15,350 --> 01:02:17,790
You're bleeding. Are you all right?

809
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:19,529
Hold on a second.

810
01:02:20,730 --> 01:02:22,029
It's all right.

811
01:02:22,029 --> 01:02:23,560
Wait, I have a bandage.

812
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,759
Is there a lot of blood?

813
01:02:25,759 --> 01:02:27,899
My goodness.

814
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:45,980
I should...

815
01:02:46,589 --> 01:02:48,149
get back to work then.

816
01:02:48,149 --> 01:02:50,989
Right, of course. Thanks again.

817
01:02:54,989 --> 01:02:56,930
What am I thinking?
It would be a miracle...

818
01:02:56,930 --> 01:02:58,799
if I met her again after 15 years.

819
01:03:10,839 --> 01:03:12,810
(Good Casting)

820
01:03:13,180 --> 01:03:14,580
Take my hand and follow me.

821
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:16,819
Water.

822
01:03:16,819 --> 01:03:19,080
Getting physical with you
is the answer.

823
01:03:19,250 --> 01:03:20,450
No!

824
01:03:20,450 --> 01:03:22,219
You are to get
the job done yourself now.

825
01:03:22,219 --> 01:03:24,160
We'll lure Wang Kai out
with this chip.

826
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:25,919
- What are you going to do?
- I'll make my move.

827
01:03:25,919 --> 01:03:27,160
I'll show myself.

828
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:29,529
I'll be fine even without you.

829
01:03:29,529 --> 01:03:30,629
I'm really leaving then.

830
01:03:30,629 --> 01:03:32,299
Why are you still here?

831
01:03:32,299 --> 01:03:33,529
I should go.

832
01:03:33,529 --> 01:03:35,669
Is everything all right?
I'm just worried.

833
01:03:35,669 --> 01:03:37,140
The deal will take place
at a distribution center in Paju.

834
01:03:37,140 --> 01:03:39,040
We'll raid the place
and make arrests.

835
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:40,069
The package has been verified.

836
01:03:40,069 --> 01:03:41,509
Transaction is complete.
Head inside.

837
01:03:41,770 --> 01:03:43,080
Stop right there!
