<b>(Episode 11)</b>

2
00:00:32,349 --> 00:00:34,080
<b>Hello, Director.</b>

3
00:00:34,084 --> 00:00:35,815
<b>Nice to meet you.</b>

4
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:38,880
<b>I already heard from Tae Eun.</b>

5
00:00:38,889 --> 00:00:40,520
<b>Is this your first time here?</b>

6
00:00:40,524 --> 00:00:42,915
<b>Yes, it's my first time.</b>

7
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:45,285
<b>Please, let's go inside.</b>

8
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:49,795
<b>May I ask you for the reason?</b>

9
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:54,270
<b>You never visited us for the last eight years.</b>

10
00:00:54,271 --> 00:00:57,135
<b>Why did you suddenly want to visit?</b>

11
00:00:59,943 --> 00:01:02,035
<b>I wanted to check...</b>

12
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:10,485
<b>that he was stuck in there...</b>

13
00:01:11,054 --> 00:01:13,755
<b>with no rights whatsoever.</b>

14
00:01:15,392 --> 00:01:16,960
<b>I wanted to know...</b>

15
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,460
<b>(Quarantine Treatment Room 1: Moon Seong Ho)</b>

16
00:01:18,462 --> 00:01:20,425
<b>that there was nothing he could do.</b>

17
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:24,865
<b>And I also wanted to know...</b>

18
00:01:25,302 --> 00:01:27,665
<b>that I'd never lose someone again because of him.</b>

19
00:01:32,642 --> 00:01:36,740
<b>This is the first and the last time I'm doing this favor for you.</b>

20
00:01:36,746 --> 00:01:38,910
<b>Going there doesn't do you any good.</b>

21
00:01:38,915 --> 00:01:40,615
<b>I know.</b>

22
00:01:40,984 --> 00:01:44,150
<b>I just wanted to check that it really wasn't him.</b>

23
00:01:44,154 --> 00:01:46,280
<b>I know what you're thinking.</b>

24
00:01:46,289 --> 00:01:48,690
<b>It's not true. That won't ever happen again.</b>

25
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:51,385
<b>You saw him locked up.</b>

26
00:01:52,429 --> 00:01:54,530
<b>Ha Jin is a celebrity.</b>

27
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:56,760
<b>She may have some obsessed fans.</b>

28
00:01:56,766 --> 00:01:58,960
<b>She can be more careful from now on.</b>

29
00:01:58,969 --> 00:02:01,695
<b>So don't take it too seriously.</b>

30
00:02:03,507 --> 00:02:06,065
<b>I thought the same thing eight years ago.</b>

31
00:02:07,511 --> 00:02:09,675
<b>I thought it was just a coincidence.</b>

32
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,945
<b>I thought it wasn't a big deal.</b>

33
00:02:26,329 --> 00:02:28,355
<b>Did you wait for long?</b>

34
00:02:31,468 --> 00:02:33,365
<b>I saw him at the convenience store.</b>

35
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:36,100
<b>Are these silver?</b>

36
00:02:36,106 --> 00:02:37,865
<b>Doesn't it look nice?</b>

37
00:02:39,042 --> 00:02:40,310
<b>Yes.</b>

38
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:42,075
<b>I saw him at a cafe.</b>

39
00:02:44,114 --> 00:02:47,775
<b>I saw him many times but thought nothing of it.</b>

40
00:02:48,018 --> 00:02:50,445
<b>I thought it was understandable since he lived nearby.</b>

41
00:02:50,987 --> 00:02:52,885
<b>Had I...</b>

42
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,615
<b>suspected him at least once...</b>

43
00:02:57,227 --> 00:03:00,285
<b>Had I taken it more seriously, I would've been able to stop it.</b>

44
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,295
<b>I'm the reason...</b>

45
00:03:03,033 --> 00:03:04,825
<b>Seo Yeon died.</b>

46
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,665
<b>I don't think I'll be able to live if the same thing happened again.</b>

47
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,535
<b>I can't lose Ha Jin.</b>

48
00:03:36,933 --> 00:03:37,930
<b>Are you looking for something?</b>

49
00:03:37,934 --> 00:03:39,560
<b>I can't find the other one.</b>

50
00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:41,100
<b>Didn't you keep them together?</b>

51
00:03:41,104 --> 00:03:43,500
<b>I thought I did, but I can't find one of them.</b>

52
00:03:43,506 --> 00:03:46,805
<b>I had purposely set them aside for today's meeting.</b>

53
00:03:46,943 --> 00:03:49,875
<b>Maybe it got snatched by one of your clothes.</b>

54
00:03:49,946 --> 00:03:51,610
<b>Look carefully.</b>

55
00:03:51,615 --> 00:03:53,675
<b>Are you sure you didn't wear it?</b>

56
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:55,575
<b>Not in a million years.</b>

57
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,385
<b>Gosh.</b>

58
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,285
<b>This would've been perfect.</b>

59
00:04:29,286 --> 00:04:31,150
<b>You're here early.</b>

60
00:04:31,154 --> 00:04:32,915
<b>Hello.</b>

61
00:04:32,989 --> 00:04:34,120
<b>Hello.</b>

62
00:04:34,124 --> 00:04:37,555
<b>- Hello. Take this first. - What?</b>

63
00:04:39,629 --> 00:04:41,090
<b>If you're hesitant about saying something, then don't.</b>

64
00:04:41,097 --> 00:04:42,960
<b>Just answer their questions. Don't say anything unnecessary.</b>

65
00:04:42,966 --> 00:04:44,600
<b>- Okay. - Should I wait in the car...</b>

66
00:04:44,601 --> 00:04:45,960
<b>around 9pm?</b>

67
00:04:45,969 --> 00:04:47,730
<b>- Yes. - That's okay.</b>

68
00:04:47,737 --> 00:04:49,935
<b>I'll drop her home.</b>

69
00:04:51,107 --> 00:04:53,065
<b>That'd be great.</b>

70
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:56,835
<b>- Let's go. - Okay.</b>

71
00:05:04,187 --> 00:05:07,190
<b>You two look great together. Right?</b>

72
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,755
<b>I guess.</b>

73
00:05:08,825 --> 00:05:10,720
<b>Do you have a lot of time today?</b>

74
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:13,020
<b>I'd like to ask you every single question I have.</b>

75
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:14,795
<b>Sure.</b>

76
00:05:15,198 --> 00:05:18,600
<b>I always study beforehand,</b>

77
00:05:18,601 --> 00:05:21,465
<b>but I get stuck every time I write my scripts.</b>

78
00:05:21,971 --> 00:05:24,640
<b>Let's drink. They seem busy.</b>

79
00:05:24,641 --> 00:05:26,505
<b>Okay.</b>

80
00:05:26,676 --> 00:05:27,940
<b>Look at this.</b>

81
00:05:27,944 --> 00:05:30,440
<b>These are all the questions I have for you.</b>

82
00:05:30,447 --> 00:05:32,005
<b>I see.</b>

83
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,675
<b>I saw your movie.</b>

84
00:05:35,985 --> 00:05:37,845
<b>I see.</b>

85
00:05:38,221 --> 00:05:41,550
<b>You looked beautiful from the opening scene.</b>

86
00:05:41,558 --> 00:05:43,185
<b>I liked your acting as well.</b>

87
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,485
<b>Really?</b>

88
00:05:45,795 --> 00:05:47,525
<b>Let me be honest.</b>

89
00:05:47,897 --> 00:05:49,830
<b>I was a bit hesitant at first.</b>

90
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:52,230
<b>But after watching it, I was sure.</b>

91
00:05:52,235 --> 00:05:55,935
<b>I realized I could count on you.</b>

92
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:59,540
<b>Thank you for saying that. I'll do my best.</b>

93
00:05:59,542 --> 00:06:01,040
<b>Okay.</b>

94
00:06:01,044 --> 00:06:03,410
<b>Let's eat while we chat.</b>

95
00:06:03,413 --> 00:06:05,110
<b>Our food was served a while ago.</b>

96
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:07,510
<b>I'm sorry for blabbering on and on.</b>

97
00:06:07,517 --> 00:06:09,875
<b>Enjoy your meal.</b>

98
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:12,680
<b>Ha Jin, this is really delicious. Try it.</b>

99
00:06:12,689 --> 00:06:14,355
<b>Okay.</b>

100
00:06:15,425 --> 00:06:17,090
<b>When Ha Na was young,</b>

101
00:06:17,093 --> 00:06:20,160
<b>she didn't know she was allergic to shrimp...</b>

102
00:06:20,163 --> 00:06:22,690
<b>and thought they always stung.</b>

103
00:06:22,699 --> 00:06:25,660
<b>She always thought it was strange but continued to eat them.</b>

104
00:06:25,668 --> 00:06:27,600
<b>In the end, she was carried to the ER...</b>

105
00:06:27,604 --> 00:06:30,000
<b>but still didn't know it was because of the shrimp.</b>

106
00:06:30,006 --> 00:06:31,140
<b>Isn't that funny?</b>

107
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:33,905
<b>Yes, it is.</b>

108
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,275
<b>You can't have shrimp.</b>

109
00:06:42,118 --> 00:06:44,520
<b>That was shrimp? I didn't know.</b>

110
00:06:44,521 --> 00:06:46,180
<b>What is it? Are you allergic?</b>

111
00:06:46,189 --> 00:06:48,120
<b>Yes, my throat swells.</b>

112
00:06:48,124 --> 00:06:50,320
<b>I break out in hives as well. It takes me a while to get better.</b>

113
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:52,360
<b>I'm so sorry.</b>

114
00:06:52,362 --> 00:06:54,825
<b>It could've been dangerous.</b>

115
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,795
<b>I'm glad.</b>

116
00:06:56,833 --> 00:07:00,470
<b>Your boyfriend knows everything about you.</b>

117
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:02,035
<b>Lucky you.</b>

118
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,235
<b>We should eat this.</b>

119
00:07:05,942 --> 00:07:07,905
<b>How did you know?</b>

120
00:07:07,944 --> 00:07:10,135
<b>Have I told you before?</b>

121
00:07:13,249 --> 00:07:15,910
<b>Please excuse me. I need to go to the restroom.</b>

122
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:17,685
<b>Sure.</b>

123
00:07:22,592 --> 00:07:25,420
<b>It's probably best for her to practice reading the news...</b>

124
00:07:25,428 --> 00:07:26,930
<b>as soon as possible, right?</b>

125
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:28,525
<b>Yes.</b>

126
00:07:29,499 --> 00:07:32,800
<b>But then again, he'll help you with that.</b>

127
00:07:32,802 --> 00:07:34,830
<b>I have nothing to worry about, right?</b>

128
00:07:34,838 --> 00:07:38,465
<b>Of course. I bet he'll be very strict.</b>

129
00:07:39,843 --> 00:07:43,575
<b>Excuse me. I need to take this.</b>

130
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,850
<b>Let's drink.</b>

131
00:07:51,855 --> 00:07:53,445
<b>Okay.</b>

132
00:08:00,196 --> 00:08:01,995
<b>Are you confident?</b>

133
00:08:02,632 --> 00:08:04,665
<b>This drama won't be easy.</b>

134
00:08:05,168 --> 00:08:07,130
<b>I'm not confident, but if I try my...</b>

135
00:08:07,136 --> 00:08:08,795
<b>You're not?</b>

136
00:08:09,172 --> 00:08:10,965
<b>Then you shouldn't do it.</b>

137
00:08:11,107 --> 00:08:13,135
<b>You should take work seriously.</b>

138
00:08:13,943 --> 00:08:14,940
<b>Sorry?</b>

139
00:08:14,944 --> 00:08:18,075
<b>Writer Hwang wanted to cast you, so I said okay.</b>

140
00:08:18,481 --> 00:08:20,305
<b>But I'm not happy with this.</b>

141
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:25,145
<b>I want the lead actress to be elegant.</b>

142
00:08:26,055 --> 00:08:28,115
<b>But you're...</b>

143
00:08:28,324 --> 00:08:30,315
<b>You probably know it too.</b>

144
00:08:31,027 --> 00:08:32,755
<b>You're far from it.</b>

145
00:08:40,904 --> 00:08:43,035
<b>Let's be honest.</b>

146
00:08:43,072 --> 00:08:46,765
<b>Do you think you're fit for the role as a news anchor?</b>

147
00:08:48,845 --> 00:08:50,735
<b>Aren't you embarrassed?</b>

148
00:08:50,847 --> 00:08:54,615
<b>I know you picked this because of your boyfriend.</b>

149
00:08:55,718 --> 00:08:59,815
<b>But then again, I guess it's a talent to date competent men.</b>

150
00:09:02,091 --> 00:09:03,785
<b>I think...</b>

151
00:09:05,094 --> 00:09:07,385
<b>you're out of line.</b>

152
00:09:08,064 --> 00:09:09,795
<b>That's great.</b>

153
00:09:09,999 --> 00:09:11,695
<b>You don't like me, right?</b>

154
00:09:11,901 --> 00:09:15,235
<b>Then let's not waste any energy and just put an end to this.</b>

155
00:09:15,271 --> 00:09:18,540
<b>Writer Hwang is just infatuated with Anchor Lee.</b>

156
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:21,470
<b>But she'll come to her senses after hearing you read the script.</b>

157
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:23,740
<b>So put an end to this.</b>

158
00:09:23,746 --> 00:09:26,775
<b>Say that your schedule is busy or that you're feeling sick.</b>

159
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:29,115
<b>Do you understand?</b>

160
00:09:44,867 --> 00:09:48,935
<b>I'm sorry. It was urgent.</b>

161
00:09:50,907 --> 00:09:53,035
<b>What were we talking about again?</b>

162
00:09:53,209 --> 00:09:56,110
<b>Right. We were talking about how excellent of a teacher...</b>

163
00:09:56,112 --> 00:09:59,205
<b>you'd be for her.</b>

164
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,980
<b>Of course. I'm going to do my best.</b>

165
00:10:02,986 --> 00:10:04,720
<b>You'll be taken aback during the script reading...</b>

166
00:10:04,721 --> 00:10:06,320
<b>by how realistic she sounds.</b>

167
00:10:06,322 --> 00:10:09,550
<b>Oh, my! I'm already looking forward to this.</b>

168
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:13,220
<b>By the way, she didn't win this role...</b>

169
00:10:13,229 --> 00:10:15,160
<b>because of our relationship, did she?</b>

170
00:10:15,164 --> 00:10:16,855
<b>Not at all.</b>

171
00:10:18,001 --> 00:10:19,400
<b>I'm just worried...</b>

172
00:10:19,402 --> 00:10:22,370
<b>that people might think she got this role...</b>

173
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:23,940
<b>because of her boyfriend.</b>

174
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,670
<b>Not at all. That's absurd.</b>

175
00:10:26,676 --> 00:10:28,510
<b>We wouldn't do that.</b>

176
00:10:28,511 --> 00:10:30,040
<b>After all, she's the one who'll be acting.</b>

177
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:33,505
<b>Right? I guess that was unnecessary to ask.</b>

178
00:10:33,616 --> 00:10:34,880
<b>Those who think such foolish thoughts...</b>

179
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,050
<b>are the weird ones.</b>

180
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,420
<b>Of course.</b>

181
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,850
<b>We shouldn't deal with scumbags like them.</b>

182
00:10:39,856 --> 00:10:41,615
<b>Right?</b>

183
00:10:41,624 --> 00:10:43,215
<b>Right.</b>

184
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:47,385
<b>Ha Jin, don't be hurt by such rumors, okay?</b>

185
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:49,125
<b>Okay.</b>

186
00:11:00,109 --> 00:11:02,905
<b>Can you buy me a can of beer?</b>

187
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:06,905
<b>You drank a lot of wine earlier.</b>

188
00:11:07,316 --> 00:11:09,415
<b>Just one can.</b>

189
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:12,485
<b>It's just that I feel so frustrated.</b>

190
00:11:13,189 --> 00:11:15,585
<b>Just buy me one can of beer.</b>

191
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,535
<b>Thank you.</b>

192
00:11:47,256 --> 00:11:49,055
<b>Does that hit the spot?</b>

193
00:11:49,592 --> 00:11:51,385
<b>A bit.</b>

194
00:11:54,997 --> 00:11:56,555
<b>Here.</b>

195
00:12:06,542 --> 00:12:09,275
<b>I'm going to get off.</b>

196
00:13:02,165 --> 00:13:04,025
<b>Are you all right?</b>

197
00:13:05,668 --> 00:13:07,865
<b>Why did you drink so much?</b>

198
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,195
<b>You heard everything earlier, didn't you?</b>

199
00:13:11,641 --> 00:13:14,035
<b>You heard everything earlier.</b>

200
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:19,045
<b>The conversation between the director and me.</b>

201
00:13:21,818 --> 00:13:25,945
<b>Not everything. I caught a few sentences.</b>

202
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,490
<b>But why are you speaking casually to me now?</b>

203
00:13:28,491 --> 00:13:30,390
<b>It's about time that we did.</b>

204
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:33,655
<b>Until when do I have to address as Anchor Lee?</b>

205
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:35,330
<b>Is this the alcohol talking?</b>

206
00:13:35,331 --> 00:13:37,795
<b>If you think it's unfair, you can talk to me casually too.</b>

207
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:47,105
<b>Is that what you think too?</b>

208
00:13:48,811 --> 00:13:51,275
<b>Do I look cheap?</b>

209
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,875
<b>Am I that awful?</b>

210
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:59,745
<b>Do you have the same opinion of me as the director?</b>

211
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:02,520
<b>Director, my foot.</b>

212
00:14:02,525 --> 00:14:05,025
<b>He's such a scumbag.</b>

213
00:14:05,561 --> 00:14:07,360
<b>He couldn't say anything in front of the writer,</b>

214
00:14:07,363 --> 00:14:09,855
<b>but he threatened an actress behind the writer.</b>

215
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,325
<b>Why would you care about a scumbag like that?</b>

216
00:14:13,703 --> 00:14:16,235
<b>You said you really wanted to be in that drama.</b>

217
00:14:16,539 --> 00:14:18,335
<b>Then, you should be in it.</b>

218
00:14:18,641 --> 00:14:20,905
<b>Isn't going after what you want your thing?</b>

219
00:14:23,379 --> 00:14:25,205
<b>Can an anchor...</b>

220
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:28,975
<b>badmouth someone like that?</b>

221
00:14:30,019 --> 00:14:31,585
<b>Why not?</b>

222
00:14:32,355 --> 00:14:35,285
<b>I'm really good at badmouthing people.</b>

223
00:14:39,729 --> 00:14:43,255
<b>There's no other way. I give up.</b>

224
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,330
<b>You'll give up on the drama?</b>

225
00:14:45,334 --> 00:14:47,670
<b>No, I'll be in the drama.</b>

226
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:49,900
<b>I must do it out of spite if I have to.</b>

227
00:14:49,906 --> 00:14:52,800
<b>Not the drama. I give up on speaking casually to you.</b>

228
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:55,605
<b>I won't do it, so you don't get to talk to me casually.</b>

229
00:14:55,778 --> 00:14:58,445
<b>It makes my heart flutter, so I can't have that.</b>

230
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,645
<b>And...</b>

231
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,615
<b>don't blame me later.</b>

232
00:15:07,023 --> 00:15:10,485
<b>You brought this upon yourself.</b>

233
00:15:35,384 --> 00:15:37,015
<b>What is it?</b>

234
00:15:37,553 --> 00:15:39,615
<b>We can't do this.</b>

235
00:15:40,156 --> 00:15:42,185
<b>Why not?</b>

236
00:15:43,426 --> 00:15:45,285
<b>We'll regret it.</b>

237
00:15:46,662 --> 00:15:48,855
<b>I won't regret it.</b>

238
00:15:57,106 --> 00:15:59,135
<b>No, you will.</b>

239
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:03,375
<b>Perhaps, you'll regret more than me.</b>

240
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,755
<b>Gosh, why won't she call?</b>

241
00:16:19,996 --> 00:16:23,725
<b>What? I told you to call me before you got here.</b>

242
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,095
<b>How did the meeting go? Did you do well?</b>

243
00:16:27,703 --> 00:16:28,930
<b>Why are you quiet?</b>

244
00:16:28,938 --> 00:16:30,370
<b>Did the meeting go well?</b>

245
00:16:30,373 --> 00:16:32,100
<b>Yes? Hello?</b>

246
00:16:32,108 --> 00:16:35,235
<b>Hello? Excuse me.</b>

247
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:40,610
<b>What on earth happened?</b>

248
00:16:40,616 --> 00:16:41,880
<b>You reek of alcohol.</b>

249
00:16:41,884 --> 00:16:44,150
<b>Ha Jin, did you get drunk and cause trouble?</b>

250
00:16:44,153 --> 00:16:46,620
<b>Is that why you look sad?</b>

251
00:16:46,622 --> 00:16:48,715
<b>I didn't cause trouble.</b>

252
00:16:48,724 --> 00:16:50,120
<b>You did. I can tell.</b>

253
00:16:50,126 --> 00:16:51,390
<b>How did you mess it up?</b>

254
00:16:51,394 --> 00:16:55,095
<b>Don't tell me you got excited and overly friendly with them.</b>

255
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,960
<b>You did. That's what you did.</b>

256
00:16:58,968 --> 00:17:00,430
<b>How will you fix this now?</b>

257
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,000
<b>Seriously. You're making this very difficult for me.</b>

258
00:17:02,004 --> 00:17:04,800
<b>What if they say no and reject you?</b>

259
00:17:04,807 --> 00:17:06,800
<b>Why not? Why can't I do it?</b>

260
00:17:06,809 --> 00:17:08,140
<b>Why can't it be me?</b>

261
00:17:08,144 --> 00:17:09,910
<b>You can't do it? Did they already reject you?</b>

262
00:17:09,912 --> 00:17:12,540
<b>- Then, why was he nice to me? - Nice to you?</b>

263
00:17:12,548 --> 00:17:15,080
<b>He should have let me eat that shrimp.</b>

264
00:17:15,084 --> 00:17:16,150
<b>Shrimp?</b>

265
00:17:16,152 --> 00:17:20,385
<b>He took care of me, sided with me, and acted cool for no good reason.</b>

266
00:17:20,523 --> 00:17:22,390
<b>Cool? What did you say?</b>

267
00:17:22,391 --> 00:17:23,850
<b>Forget it.</b>

268
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:26,990
<b>I don't want him, either. Tell him I don't want him.</b>

269
00:17:26,996 --> 00:17:29,290
<b>Weren't we talking about the drama?</b>

270
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,100
<b>- Get out. - Hey.</b>

271
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,165
<b>Get out!</b>

272
00:17:33,369 --> 00:17:36,200
<b>I don't want you. Gosh, I don't want this either.</b>

273
00:17:36,205 --> 00:17:37,765
<b>Goodness.</b>

274
00:17:39,008 --> 00:17:41,205
<b>Unbelievable.</b>

275
00:18:50,412 --> 00:18:51,440
<b>Aren't you hungry?</b>

276
00:18:51,447 --> 00:18:54,180
<b>There's a famous sushi restaurant nearby. Should we get some?</b>

277
00:18:54,183 --> 00:18:56,975
<b>I'm tired. Let's eat at home.</b>

278
00:18:56,986 --> 00:18:58,520
<b>Okay.</b>

279
00:18:58,521 --> 00:19:00,945
<b>You're not asking about Anchor Lee today.</b>

280
00:19:00,956 --> 00:19:02,320
<b>Whenever you came to do a radio show,</b>

281
00:19:02,324 --> 00:19:04,855
<b>you would think about calling him.</b>

282
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:08,490
<b>Something happened between you two, right?</b>

283
00:19:08,497 --> 00:19:09,930
<b>What is it?</b>

284
00:19:09,932 --> 00:19:12,925
<b>Nothing happened. I'm just tired today.</b>

285
00:19:19,108 --> 00:19:20,370
<b>Yes, I just came down.</b>

286
00:19:20,376 --> 00:19:22,175
<b>- Where are you? - What are you doing?</b>

287
00:19:25,447 --> 00:19:28,075
<b>I'm in the lobby on the first floor. Where?</b>

288
00:19:29,218 --> 00:19:30,210
<b>What is this?</b>

289
00:19:30,219 --> 00:19:32,785
<b>You said nothing happened. Why are we hiding?</b>

290
00:19:33,622 --> 00:19:35,020
<b>Right.</b>

291
00:19:35,024 --> 00:19:37,915
<b>Why did I hide? I didn't do anything wrong.</b>

292
00:19:39,128 --> 00:19:41,790
<b>What about Mr. Jo? I thought the three of us were meeting.</b>

293
00:19:41,797 --> 00:19:42,890
<b>He'll be back soon.</b>

294
00:19:42,898 --> 00:19:44,500
<b>I told him to pay for the meal since he's late.</b>

295
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,125
<b>So order something expensive.</b>

296
00:19:46,502 --> 00:19:48,170
<b>You did something wrong.</b>

297
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:49,300
<b>When you met the writer and the director,</b>

298
00:19:49,305 --> 00:19:51,170
<b>did you mess up in front of Anchor Lee?</b>

299
00:19:51,173 --> 00:19:52,700
<b>Mess up?</b>

300
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:55,105
<b>I didn't do anything wrong.</b>

301
00:19:56,345 --> 00:19:57,680
<b>Right.</b>

302
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,210
<b>Why must I avoid him? I didn't do anything wrong.</b>

303
00:20:00,216 --> 00:20:03,015
<b>I can just say hello to him.</b>

304
00:20:03,085 --> 00:20:04,780
<b>We can surely exchange greetings.</b>

305
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:07,620
<b>I'm not sure if I'll be of any help in writing the article.</b>

306
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,190
<b>Schizophrenia isn't my area of expertise.</b>

307
00:20:09,191 --> 00:20:11,560
<b>You'll be just advising him.</b>

308
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,760
<b>But make it sound as difficult as you can.</b>

309
00:20:13,762 --> 00:20:15,395
<b>I want him to suffer a bit.</b>

310
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,325
<b>Let's go say hi.</b>

311
00:20:17,499 --> 00:20:19,065
<b>What?</b>

312
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:31,410
<b>What brings you here, Doctor Yoo?</b>

313
00:20:31,413 --> 00:20:33,805
<b>Hi, Ha Jin.</b>

314
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:34,880
<b>It's been a while.</b>

315
00:20:34,883 --> 00:20:37,510
<b>My gosh. It's been so long.</b>

316
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:40,245
<b>I had no idea that I would run into you here.</b>

317
00:20:41,757 --> 00:20:44,290
<b>By the way, do you know each other?</b>

318
00:20:44,293 --> 00:20:46,585
<b>Why are you guys together?</b>

319
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:50,030
<b>I'm sorry. I'm late.</b>

320
00:20:50,032 --> 00:20:52,360
<b>Hello. I've heard a lot about you.</b>

321
00:20:52,368 --> 00:20:54,570
<b>I didn't know it was possible for Jeong Hoon to have any friends.</b>

322
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:56,495
<b>You're his only friend, right?</b>

323
00:20:56,739 --> 00:20:58,335
<b>"Friends"?</b>

324
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:01,135
<b>Doctor Yoo and Anchor Lee?</b>

325
00:21:01,744 --> 00:21:04,905
<b>- Goodness, hello. - Hello.</b>

326
00:21:04,913 --> 00:21:07,280
<b>Are we all eating together?</b>

327
00:21:07,283 --> 00:21:09,010
<b>Oh, no. We aren't.</b>

328
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:11,645
<b>If I'm not too much of a nuisance, may I go with you?</b>

329
00:21:13,088 --> 00:21:15,515
<b>I'd like to ask something too.</b>

330
00:21:24,233 --> 00:21:27,365
<b>Doctor Yoo was here to give advice for my article.</b>

331
00:21:28,637 --> 00:21:30,100
<b>I took on a new report...</b>

332
00:21:30,105 --> 00:21:32,970
<b>on crimes committed by schizophrenic patients.</b>

333
00:21:32,975 --> 00:21:34,905
<b>Oh, I see.</b>

334
00:21:35,644 --> 00:21:37,735
<b>But it doesn't look so great.</b>

335
00:21:38,247 --> 00:21:39,840
<b>I wouldn't have come if I had known.</b>

336
00:21:39,848 --> 00:21:43,315
<b>Exactly. You shouldn't have. You're very slow.</b>

337
00:21:45,354 --> 00:21:48,020
<b>Excuse me. I'd like three sushi A sets for that table...</b>

338
00:21:48,023 --> 00:21:49,650
<b>- and three sets for us. - Okay.</b>

339
00:21:49,658 --> 00:21:52,020
<b>Three for us? Are we expecting someone else?</b>

340
00:21:52,027 --> 00:21:54,390
<b>No, I just like sushi a lot.</b>

341
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:56,930
<b>Why? Is this your 1st time seeing someone eat 2 sushi meals?</b>

342
00:21:56,932 --> 00:21:58,400
<b>Yes, it's my first time.</b>

343
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,365
<b>My girlfriend can't even finish one.</b>

344
00:22:01,503 --> 00:22:04,170
<b>She must eat very little.</b>

345
00:22:04,173 --> 00:22:07,440
<b>People usually eat at least two sushi meals.</b>

346
00:22:07,443 --> 00:22:09,840
<b>No way. People usually eat one.</b>

347
00:22:09,845 --> 00:22:11,610
<b>That's why it's called one serving.</b>

348
00:22:11,613 --> 00:22:13,675
<b>You eat a lot. That's what.</b>

349
00:22:14,149 --> 00:22:15,150
<b>Yes.</b>

350
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:18,150
<b>Anyway, isn't something weird about the three of them?</b>

351
00:22:18,153 --> 00:22:20,445
<b>No. Not at all.</b>

352
00:22:20,522 --> 00:22:22,350
<b>Stop minding that table.</b>

353
00:22:22,358 --> 00:22:24,885
<b>It's none of your business.</b>

354
00:22:27,563 --> 00:22:29,530
<b>It really is a small world.</b>

355
00:22:29,531 --> 00:22:32,495
<b>I never imagined that you two would be friends.</b>

356
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:37,740
<b>Anchor Lee, I told you before...</b>

357
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,270
<b>that...</b>

358
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:42,205
<b>there was a problem with my memory.</b>

359
00:22:43,512 --> 00:22:47,575
<b>Doctor Yoo was actually my counselor for about two years.</b>

360
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:51,845
<b>Then we lost contact as I went into acting.</b>

361
00:22:52,087 --> 00:22:55,385
<b>It wouldn't be good if people found out I was counseled.</b>

362
00:22:55,657 --> 00:22:57,255
<b>I see.</b>

363
00:22:57,726 --> 00:23:00,820
<b>It's shocking to think that it had been five years already.</b>

364
00:23:00,829 --> 00:23:02,555
<b>Isn't that so, Doctor Yoo?</b>

365
00:23:02,564 --> 00:23:04,125
<b>You're right.</b>

366
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:08,130
<b>But you two seem like an unlikely match.</b>

367
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:10,335
<b>Since when were you two friends?</b>

368
00:23:13,542 --> 00:23:16,740
<b>For a long time. Since when we were 11.</b>

369
00:23:16,745 --> 00:23:19,875
<b>Yes, it's a pretty gross relationship.</b>

370
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:23,075
<b>You two must be very close.</b>

371
00:23:23,419 --> 00:23:24,750
<b>Oh, right.</b>

372
00:23:24,753 --> 00:23:28,385
<b>Anchor Lee, may I have a word with you after we eat?</b>

373
00:23:29,258 --> 00:23:30,855
<b>Sure.</b>

374
00:23:33,529 --> 00:23:36,425
<b>I've been here once for a production presentation.</b>

375
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:40,365
<b>It's kind of strange to see how quiet it is.</b>

376
00:23:41,804 --> 00:23:45,865
<b>There aren't a lot of places in our building where we can have privacy.</b>

377
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:58,350
<b>I didn't know...</b>

378
00:23:58,353 --> 00:24:02,185
<b>what to say or how I should face you when I ran into you again.</b>

379
00:24:07,563 --> 00:24:09,725
<b>Did you already know...</b>

380
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:13,765
<b>that I had a problem with my memory?</b>

381
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:20,205
<b>And that I had Doctor Yoo as a counselor?</b>

382
00:24:21,109 --> 00:24:22,935
<b>Did you know?</b>

383
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:27,105
<b>Yes.</b>

384
00:24:37,326 --> 00:24:39,390
<b>Was that why you were so good to me?</b>

385
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:41,285
<b>Did you pity me?</b>

386
00:24:41,797 --> 00:24:42,890
<b>No.</b>

387
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:44,730
<b>You pitied me, didn't you?</b>

388
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:46,665
<b>I never pitied you.</b>

389
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:50,935
<b>I'm not in a position to pity anyone,</b>

390
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:54,265
<b>and there's no reason for you to be pitied.</b>

391
00:24:56,378 --> 00:24:58,205
<b>You are very difficult,</b>

392
00:24:58,447 --> 00:25:00,105
<b>Anchor Lee.</b>

393
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,920
<b>You always seem to tell the truth,</b>

394
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:10,385
<b>yet it doesn't seem like the truth.</b>

395
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:13,755
<b>I hear a lot from you,</b>

396
00:25:13,896 --> 00:25:16,225
<b>but it seems like I heard nothing.</b>

397
00:25:17,332 --> 00:25:19,495
<b>It's frustrating at times,</b>

398
00:25:21,069 --> 00:25:23,065
<b>but I keep wanting to know more.</b>

399
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,065
<b>I find you very difficult,</b>

400
00:25:29,144 --> 00:25:30,835
<b>Anchor Lee.</b>

401
00:25:52,935 --> 00:25:54,030
<b>Hello?</b>

402
00:25:54,036 --> 00:25:57,195
<b>Doctor Yoo, this is Yeo Ha Jin.</b>

403
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:59,705
<b>You haven't changed your number.</b>

404
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,940
<b>This place is still the same.</b>

405
00:26:05,948 --> 00:26:07,640
<b>And it's still empty.</b>

406
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:09,510
<b>There are a lot of customers during lunchtime.</b>

407
00:26:09,518 --> 00:26:11,115
<b>I see.</b>

408
00:26:12,554 --> 00:26:14,750
<b>You're still the same too, Doctor Yoo.</b>

409
00:26:14,756 --> 00:26:16,755
<b>You haven't gotten old at all.</b>

410
00:26:16,925 --> 00:26:20,460
<b>Wouldn't it be heartbreaking if I grew noticeably old in five years?</b>

411
00:26:20,462 --> 00:26:22,195
<b>Is that so?</b>

412
00:26:22,464 --> 00:26:24,730
<b>It's really great to see you again.</b>

413
00:26:24,733 --> 00:26:28,065
<b>I was too shocked before to celebrate our reunion.</b>

414
00:26:28,637 --> 00:26:31,070
<b>- Hello. What would you like? - Hello.</b>

415
00:26:31,073 --> 00:26:32,240
<b>Two bowls of rice soup, please.</b>

416
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,105
<b>- Okay. - Yes.</b>

417
00:26:34,409 --> 00:26:38,645
<b>Right, what did Anchor Lee say about me?</b>

418
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:41,445
<b>I'm sure you two talk a lot since you're friends.</b>

419
00:26:41,717 --> 00:26:44,475
<b>Well, I don't know.</b>

420
00:26:44,786 --> 00:26:47,415
<b>I'm guessing it wasn't anything great.</b>

421
00:26:49,625 --> 00:26:51,285
<b>To be honest,</b>

422
00:26:51,627 --> 00:26:54,485
<b>I like him a lot.</b>

423
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:58,155
<b>But he won't accept my feelings.</b>

424
00:26:59,801 --> 00:27:02,195
<b>It feels unfair to have him push me away...</b>

425
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:05,465
<b>after he confuses me by leading me on.</b>

426
00:27:05,507 --> 00:27:08,735
<b>I've always wondered why he acted like that.</b>

427
00:27:09,311 --> 00:27:11,675
<b>But I think I kind of get it...</b>

428
00:27:12,748 --> 00:27:14,605
<b>thanks to you.</b>

429
00:27:15,484 --> 00:27:17,080
<b>What do you mean?</b>

430
00:27:17,085 --> 00:27:19,945
<b>You once told me...</b>

431
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:25,585
<b>that your best friend has a disease where he can't forget anything.</b>

432
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:32,165
<b>I had so much fun and was very happy.</b>

433
00:27:33,602 --> 00:27:36,695
<b>I remember those feelings vividly.</b>

434
00:27:36,872 --> 00:27:38,605
<b>But I have...</b>

435
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:42,205
<b>no idea who I was with at that time.</b>

436
00:27:43,178 --> 00:27:45,210
<b>It definitely wasn't Ha Kyung.</b>

437
00:27:45,213 --> 00:27:47,740
<b>There's no need to remember everything.</b>

438
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:49,880
<b>People all forget and move on.</b>

439
00:27:49,885 --> 00:27:51,815
<b>That's normal.</b>

440
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:54,585
<b>This is normal?</b>

441
00:27:54,856 --> 00:27:58,885
<b>I know one person who isn't like that.</b>

442
00:27:58,994 --> 00:28:03,895
<b>He's my best friend since when we were 11.</b>

443
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:08,565
<b>He can't forget anything.</b>

444
00:28:09,204 --> 00:28:10,330
<b>Why not?</b>

445
00:28:10,338 --> 00:28:12,105
<b>Because of a disease.</b>

446
00:28:12,641 --> 00:28:14,535
<b>A disease that won't let him forget.</b>

447
00:28:21,249 --> 00:28:24,615
<b>I can tell by your face that I must be right.</b>

448
00:28:25,387 --> 00:28:27,245
<b>I thought so.</b>

449
00:28:27,756 --> 00:28:30,050
<b>Anchor Lee often said...</b>

450
00:28:30,058 --> 00:28:32,485
<b>he has too good of a memory.</b>

451
00:28:32,728 --> 00:28:36,590
<b>- That's... Did I... - I heard many things from you...</b>

452
00:28:36,598 --> 00:28:39,125
<b>when I was counseled,</b>

453
00:28:40,068 --> 00:28:43,995
<b>but I could never forget what you said about your friend.</b>

454
00:28:45,507 --> 00:28:48,405
<b>I guess it's because that sounded very special to me.</b>

455
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,105
<b>It feels like I finally resolved my riddle.</b>

456
00:28:56,451 --> 00:28:59,315
<b>Did you say it was hyperthymesia?</b>

457
00:29:01,523 --> 00:29:03,355
<b>The name of that disease.</b>

458
00:29:04,626 --> 00:29:05,620
<b>(Hyperthymesia)</b>

459
00:29:05,627 --> 00:29:06,960
<b>Reporter Choi Yul.</b>

460
00:29:06,962 --> 00:29:09,160
<b>I heard people who were arrested...</b>

461
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:11,530
<b>for using violent language and behavior...</b>

462
00:29:11,533 --> 00:29:13,900
<b>against medical staff has doubled in the last three years.</b>

463
00:29:13,902 --> 00:29:16,530
<b>Yes, although the punishments became reinforced...</b>

464
00:29:16,538 --> 00:29:19,000
<b>after the amendment of the Medical Service Act in April,</b>

465
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:21,470
<b>there aren't many people who became detained...</b>

466
00:29:21,476 --> 00:29:24,170
<b>because most cases are settled.</b>

467
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:25,180
<b>Not many can easily...</b>

468
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,610
<b>- deal with a lawsuit. - "There is no known cure."</b>

469
00:29:27,616 --> 00:29:31,080
<b>In the end, it'll be the most important...</b>

470
00:29:31,086 --> 00:29:33,280
<b>to stop these things from happening...</b>

471
00:29:33,288 --> 00:29:36,950

472
00:29:36,958 --> 00:29:38,690
<b>Thank you, Reporter Choi Yul.</b>

473
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:41,730
<b>Thank you for watching "Lee Jeong Hoon's News Live".</b>

474
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:43,795
<b>Have a great night.</b>

475
00:29:48,904 --> 00:29:50,600
<b>- Great work. - Great job.</b>

476
00:29:50,605 --> 00:29:53,270
<b>- Great work. - Great work.</b>

477
00:29:53,275 --> 00:29:55,605
<b>- Great job. - Great work today.</b>

478
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:02,145
<b>Great work.</b>

479
00:30:08,857 --> 00:30:10,715
<b>You're very difficult,</b>

480
00:30:10,926 --> 00:30:12,485
<b>Anchor Lee.</b>

481
00:30:14,095 --> 00:30:17,495
<b>You always seem to tell the truth,</b>

482
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:20,325
<b>yet it doesn't seem like the truth.</b>

483
00:30:22,003 --> 00:30:24,495
<b>I hear a lot from you,</b>

484
00:30:24,673 --> 00:30:27,135
<b>but it seems like I heard nothing.</b>

485
00:30:29,377 --> 00:30:31,535
<b>It's frustrating at times,</b>

486
00:30:33,014 --> 00:30:35,105
<b>but I keep wanting to know more.</b>

487
00:30:36,852 --> 00:30:38,885
<b>I find you very difficult,</b>

488
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:40,915
<b>Anchor Lee.</b>

489
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,425
<b>(Tae Eun)</b>

490
00:30:56,438 --> 00:30:58,900
<b>What suddenly brings you here?</b>

491
00:30:58,907 --> 00:31:01,165
<b>I caused a bit of an accident.</b>

492
00:31:01,309 --> 00:31:02,840
<b>Like what?</b>

493
00:31:02,844 --> 00:31:05,580
<b>Ha Jin found out...</b>

494
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,445
<b>about your disease.</b>

495
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,210
<b>It's my mistake.</b>

496
00:31:10,218 --> 00:31:13,180
<b>I once mentioned you during our session.</b>

497
00:31:13,188 --> 00:31:16,855
<b>It was just once, but she remembered it.</b>

498
00:31:18,994 --> 00:31:20,625
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

499
00:31:20,929 --> 00:31:23,395
<b>It's not your fault I have that disease.</b>

500
00:31:23,865 --> 00:31:27,060
<b>There's no reason to hide it from everyone forever.</b>

501
00:31:27,068 --> 00:31:28,695
<b>So...</b>

502
00:31:28,937 --> 00:31:32,405
<b>how much does she know about her condition?</b>

503
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:35,705
<b>Why does she think there's a problem with her memory?</b>

504
00:31:35,844 --> 00:31:37,675
<b>A motorcycle accident.</b>

505
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:39,210
<b>She thinks she got badly hurt...</b>

506
00:31:39,214 --> 00:31:43,010
<b>because of that accident, fell unconscious, then woke up,</b>

507
00:31:43,018 --> 00:31:46,850
<b>and that it caused a momentary problem with her memory.</b>

508
00:31:46,855 --> 00:31:48,685
<b>That's what she knows.</b>

509
00:31:49,524 --> 00:31:51,155
<b>By any chance,</b>

510
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:55,260
<b>did she ever tell you about her condition?</b>

511
00:31:55,263 --> 00:31:57,725
<b>I heard she said she isn't normal.</b>

512
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,365
<b>Yes.</b>

513
00:32:01,136 --> 00:32:04,535
<b>She still thinks there's a problem with her memory.</b>

514
00:32:04,572 --> 00:32:06,705
<b>And she seems to be confused.</b>

515
00:32:06,775 --> 00:32:08,410
<b>Why didn't you tell me?</b>

516
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:11,205
<b>It seemed like she didn't want others to find out.</b>

517
00:32:11,913 --> 00:32:15,175
<b>I can't tell you something she wants to hide.</b>

518
00:32:18,753 --> 00:32:20,915
<b>To be honest, I'm nervous...</b>

519
00:32:21,089 --> 00:32:23,690
<b>that things will get out of our hands.</b>

520
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:25,455
<b>If...</b>

521
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:28,020
<b>she remembers Seo Yeon,</b>

522
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:30,530
<b>you also know what could happen.</b>

523
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:34,525
<b>I don't want to see you or Ha Jin get hurt.</b>

524
00:32:34,836 --> 00:32:36,730
<b>Don't do anything you'll regret.</b>

525
00:32:36,738 --> 00:32:38,595
<b>I'm doing my best.</b>

526
00:32:38,673 --> 00:32:41,635
<b>I also don't want her to be hurt.</b>

527
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:43,270
<b>Don't worry.</b>

528
00:33:11,172 --> 00:33:12,700
<b>Yes, Anchor Lee.</b>

529
00:33:12,707 --> 00:33:15,510
<b>If it's okay with you, may I check the footage?</b>

530
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:16,840
<b>The security footage?</b>

531
00:33:16,845 --> 00:33:19,305
<b>I thought I'd better check.</b>

532
00:33:19,981 --> 00:33:23,645
<b>I'm sure it'll be fine. Nothing special happened.</b>

533
00:33:24,052 --> 00:33:26,615
<b>But I'll tell Chul to send it over.</b>

534
00:33:27,055 --> 00:33:29,855
<b>(Episode 12)</b>

535
00:33:34,662 --> 00:33:37,525
<b>What? Since when was that camera there?</b>

536
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:39,665
<b>Darn it.</b>

537
00:34:00,889 --> 00:34:02,455
<b>Yes, Ha Kyung.</b>

538
00:34:03,024 --> 00:34:05,090
<b>I was going to send it over,</b>

539
00:34:05,093 --> 00:34:07,590
<b>but the settings were all messed up.</b>

540
00:34:07,595 --> 00:34:09,895
<b>Nothing was recorded.</b>

541
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:13,600
<b>Really? What happened?</b>

542
00:34:13,601 --> 00:34:15,470
<b>Everything is fine now, right?</b>

543
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,595
<b>Yes, I fixed the setting.</b>

544
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:19,365
<b>Okay.</b>

545
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:30,250
<b>(Do you want to delete this footage?)</b>

546
00:34:30,251 --> 00:34:31,815
<b>(Footage deleted.)</b>

547
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,690
<b>Do you have the new big scoop?</b>

548
00:34:40,695 --> 00:34:43,630
<b>Why have you been running around with Il Kwon since the morning?</b>

549
00:34:43,631 --> 00:34:46,325
<b>Oh, it's nothing.</b>

550
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:50,300
<b>It doesn't seem like this is nothing.</b>

551
00:34:50,305 --> 00:34:53,035
<b>It looks like something is going on.</b>

552
00:34:56,111 --> 00:34:58,510
<b>- Hello. - Yes, hello.</b>

553
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:01,340
<b>Goodness, look who this is.</b>

554
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:02,550
<b>I can't believe I ran into you.</b>

555
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:05,575
<b>- Nice to meet you, Anchor Lee. - Yes.</b>

556
00:35:05,987 --> 00:35:07,850
<b>- Anyway, who are you? - Who are you?</b>

557
00:35:07,856 --> 00:35:10,650
<b>She's the director. And she's my CEO.</b>

558
00:35:10,658 --> 00:35:12,490
<b>I see. Nice to meet you.</b>

559
00:35:12,494 --> 00:35:16,630
<b>Yes, you're like Anchor Lee's mother.</b>

560
00:35:16,631 --> 00:35:20,365
<b>Please do take good care of my Ha Jin, Director.</b>

561
00:35:20,835 --> 00:35:22,170
<b>Goodness, Director.</b>

562
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:24,130
<b>His mother? I'm just his boss.</b>

563
00:35:24,139 --> 00:35:26,600
<b>I'm not that much older than him.</b>

564
00:35:26,608 --> 00:35:28,100
<b>- One second. - I see.</b>

565
00:35:28,109 --> 00:35:29,640
<b>Anyway, what brings you here?</b>

566
00:35:29,644 --> 00:35:32,840
<b>We have a meeting for a drama with the writer and the director.</b>

567
00:35:32,847 --> 00:35:35,750
<b>Oh, yes. I heard you might play the news anchor.</b>

568
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:37,610
<b>Let me know if you need anything.</b>

569
00:35:37,619 --> 00:35:39,620
<b>I was really relieved when you said you'll help us...</b>

570
00:35:39,621 --> 00:35:41,280
<b>by taking up that documentary, so I should help too.</b>

571
00:35:41,289 --> 00:35:44,050
<b>Then we should ask if she can do research here.</b>

572
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:46,925
<b>You wanted to do that, didn't you?</b>

573
00:35:46,961 --> 00:35:48,420
<b>Do you need to do research?</b>

574
00:35:48,429 --> 00:35:51,690
<b>Oh, yes. I hardly know anything, so I didn't know what to do.</b>

575
00:35:51,699 --> 00:35:53,830
<b>It would be great if I can study by seeing it in real life.</b>

576
00:35:53,835 --> 00:35:55,500
<b>Go ahead, then. That's nothing difficult.</b>

577
00:35:55,503 --> 00:35:57,230
<b>Come over whenever you have time.</b>

578
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:59,000
<b>You have nothing tomorrow.</b>

579
00:35:59,007 --> 00:36:00,600
<b>You can come tomorrow, then.</b>

580
00:36:00,608 --> 00:36:02,405
<b>Is that all right?</b>

581
00:36:02,443 --> 00:36:05,235
<b>Yes. Yes, of course.</b>

582
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:07,740
<b>Thank you. Then I'll see you tomorrow.</b>

583
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:09,550
<b>- Sure. - Please excuse us.</b>

584
00:36:09,551 --> 00:36:11,920
<b>- Goodbye. - Sure, goodbye.</b>

585
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,480
<b>Goodbye.</b>

586
00:36:13,488 --> 00:36:15,345
<b>Goodness.</b>

587
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:19,925
<b>- Thank you. - Here's your coffee.</b>

588
00:36:20,028 --> 00:36:22,030
<b>- Thank you. - I'll take that.</b>

589
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:24,830
<b>- Are we parked right outside? - Yes, it's right outside.</b>

590
00:36:24,832 --> 00:36:26,395
<b>Let's go.</b>

591
00:36:31,339 --> 00:36:34,870
<b>Chul looked at it, but the setting was wrong.</b>

592
00:36:34,876 --> 00:36:38,310
<b>He fixed it now, so it should be all right from now on.</b>

593
00:36:38,313 --> 00:36:40,775
<b>I'll keep checking from time to time.</b>

594
00:36:47,088 --> 00:36:50,050
<b>Goodness, Ha Jin. Great work today.</b>

595
00:36:50,058 --> 00:36:51,520
<b>Get a good rest at home.</b>

596
00:36:51,526 --> 00:36:52,560
<b>Okay, Ms. Park. Goodbye.</b>

597
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,390
<b>- Goodbye. - Okay.</b>

598
00:36:54,395 --> 00:36:55,990
<b>- Great work. Drive safely. - Yes, goodbye.</b>

599
00:36:55,997 --> 00:36:57,895
<b>- Yes. - Okay.</b>

600
00:37:08,876 --> 00:37:10,240
<b>It's the director.</b>

601
00:37:10,245 --> 00:37:11,875
<b>Which one?</b>

602
00:37:12,513 --> 00:37:14,280
<b>Director Ji? Don't pick it up.</b>

603
00:37:14,282 --> 00:37:17,110
<b>- Why not? - Don't pick up.</b>

604
00:37:17,118 --> 00:37:18,350
<b>Yes, Director Ji.</b>

605
00:37:18,353 --> 00:37:20,180
<b>I told you not to pick it up.</b>

606
00:37:20,188 --> 00:37:21,885
<b>Right now?</b>

607
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:46,045
<b>Do you like that picture?</b>

608
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:47,905
<b>Yes.</b>

609
00:37:48,049 --> 00:37:50,950
<b>But it'd be better if it was in my room.</b>

610
00:37:50,952 --> 00:37:53,480
<b>It's your work, so I'll buy it from you.</b>

611
00:37:53,488 --> 00:37:56,050
<b>I can always give it to you,</b>

612
00:37:56,057 --> 00:37:58,150
<b>but that picture looks the best when it's here.</b>

613
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:01,025
<b>But I'll give you another present.</b>

614
00:38:01,429 --> 00:38:02,430
<b>A present?</b>

615
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:04,695
<b>Yes, come here.</b>

616
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:12,400
<b>("Goodnight, Darling")</b>

617
00:38:12,407 --> 00:38:14,235
<b>I kept you waiting, didn't I?</b>

618
00:38:14,442 --> 00:38:16,940
<b>Something about the ending didn't seem right.</b>

619
00:38:16,944 --> 00:38:19,840
<b>I couldn't make up my mind, so I finally finished it this morning.</b>

620
00:38:19,847 --> 00:38:21,210
<b>That's why I wanted to see you.</b>

621
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:23,750
<b>I thought Ms. Yoo Mi So will be starring in this one.</b>

622
00:38:23,751 --> 00:38:25,250
<b>I saw the article.</b>

623
00:38:25,253 --> 00:38:27,280
<b>Mi So had a misunderstanding.</b>

624
00:38:27,288 --> 00:38:28,820
<b>I always told you...</b>

625
00:38:28,823 --> 00:38:31,655
<b>that you'll also play the lead role of my next movie, Ha Jin.</b>

626
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,120
<b>I see.</b>

627
00:38:33,127 --> 00:38:35,190
<b>We'll start filming at the end of the year.</b>

628
00:38:35,196 --> 00:38:37,290
<b>The lead role is a pianist,</b>

629
00:38:37,298 --> 00:38:39,500
<b>- so you need to learn to play... - I'm sorry, Director Ji.</b>

630
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:42,025
<b>I don't think I can do this.</b>

631
00:38:42,637 --> 00:38:45,540
<b>- What do you mean? - I'm starring in a drama,</b>

632
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:48,005
<b>Writer Hwang's work.</b>

633
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:52,075
<b>I thought Ms. Yoo would be playing the lead for this one.</b>

634
00:38:52,347 --> 00:38:54,440
<b>You haven't signed the contract yet, have you?</b>

635
00:38:54,449 --> 00:38:57,615
<b>Read it first. It'll help change your mind.</b>

636
00:38:58,219 --> 00:38:59,920
<b>You know what? Read it right now.</b>

637
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:03,415
<b>I'm sorry, but I really want to do this drama.</b>

638
00:39:04,926 --> 00:39:06,590
<b>I'm truly sorry.</b>

639
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:08,225
<b>I said,</b>

640
00:39:08,396 --> 00:39:10,325
<b>read it right now.</b>

641
00:39:19,907 --> 00:39:23,040
<b>I'm sorry. I was a bit flustered.</b>

642
00:39:23,044 --> 00:39:24,775
<b>You understand me, right?</b>

643
00:39:25,847 --> 00:39:27,810
<b>You didn't have to buy this.</b>

644
00:39:27,815 --> 00:39:29,815
<b>- Thanks. - No problem.</b>

645
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:37,250
<b>Is he crazy or what?</b>

646
00:39:37,258 --> 00:39:39,590
<b>He was always so loving toward Mi So,</b>

647
00:39:39,594 --> 00:39:41,020
<b>so why is he upset at you?</b>

648
00:39:41,028 --> 00:39:43,795
<b>He's the one who changed his mind.</b>

649
00:39:44,165 --> 00:39:46,660
<b>If it's too difficult for you to say no, let me talk.</b>

650
00:39:46,667 --> 00:39:49,495
<b>I'll tell him that our agency decided to do so.</b>

651
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:51,265
<b>I should.</b>

652
00:39:52,407 --> 00:39:55,405
<b>- Are you okay? - Yes, I'm fine.</b>

653
00:39:57,044 --> 00:40:01,575
<b>("Goodnight, Darling")</b>

654
00:40:21,302 --> 00:40:23,595
<b>("Goodnight, Darling")</b>

655
00:40:28,409 --> 00:40:29,440
<b>Jeong Hoon.</b>

656
00:40:29,444 --> 00:40:31,940
<b>Anchor Lee, I came to study.</b>

657
00:40:31,946 --> 00:40:32,940
<b>I see.</b>

658
00:40:32,947 --> 00:40:35,180
<b>I was just about to show her the studio control room.</b>

659
00:40:35,183 --> 00:40:36,280
<b>Do you want to come with me?</b>

660
00:40:36,284 --> 00:40:38,545
<b>No, go without me.</b>

661
00:40:42,824 --> 00:40:45,155
<b>Why is he so cold?</b>

662
00:40:45,493 --> 00:40:47,790
<b>Does he usually come to work around this time?</b>

663
00:40:47,795 --> 00:40:50,430
<b>No, he's a bit late today.</b>

664
00:40:50,431 --> 00:40:51,760
<b>He usually comes around 10pm.</b>

665
00:40:51,766 --> 00:40:53,600
<b>On Mondays, he comes at 9pm.</b>

666
00:40:53,601 --> 00:40:55,230
<b>He comes to work early.</b>

667
00:40:55,236 --> 00:40:56,570
<b>The news ends at 12am.</b>

668
00:40:56,571 --> 00:40:59,640
<b>You're right. The last news team doesn't come to work that early.</b>

669
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,870
<b>He's just meticulous.</b>

670
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,940
<b>Thanks to him, I have to come to work early as well.</b>

671
00:41:02,944 --> 00:41:05,070
<b>Please keep this a secret from him.</b>

672
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:06,745
<b>Okay.</b>

673
00:41:07,482 --> 00:41:10,610
<b>"He comes to work at 10pm and 9pm on Mondays."</b>

674
00:41:10,618 --> 00:41:12,280
<b>Why would you write that down?</b>

675
00:41:12,286 --> 00:41:13,420
<b>It's important.</b>

676
00:41:13,421 --> 00:41:16,355
<b>- Shall we go? - Sure.</b>

677
00:41:40,681 --> 00:41:43,145
<b>What are you doing there?</b>

678
00:41:44,452 --> 00:41:46,750
<b>I was curious about what you were reading.</b>

679
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:48,150
<b>You should've just asked.</b>

680
00:41:48,155 --> 00:41:51,150
<b>You seemed very focused. I didn't want to disturb you.</b>

681
00:41:51,158 --> 00:41:53,290
<b>Staring at me like that is worse.</b>

682
00:41:53,294 --> 00:41:54,620
<b>Really?</b>

683
00:41:54,629 --> 00:41:56,790
<b>So what were you reading?</b>

684
00:41:56,797 --> 00:41:58,955
<b>Can I read it too?</b>

685
00:42:01,035 --> 00:42:02,770
<b>Come sit next to me.</b>

686
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:04,365
<b>Okay.</b>

687
00:42:12,246 --> 00:42:14,710
<b>These are the articles we'll cover during the news.</b>

688
00:42:14,715 --> 00:42:16,950
<b>They're not finalized yet.</b>

689
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:19,550
<b>They'll be finalized a bit after 6pm.</b>

690
00:42:19,554 --> 00:42:21,220
<b>I see.</b>

691
00:42:21,222 --> 00:42:23,420
<b>My news will be recapping the articles...</b>

692
00:42:23,424 --> 00:42:25,120
<b>from the 9pm news.</b>

693
00:42:25,126 --> 00:42:27,190
<b>So it's important to determine which ones to omit...</b>

694
00:42:27,194 --> 00:42:28,985
<b>and which ones to dig in deeper.</b>

695
00:42:29,564 --> 00:42:31,455
<b>Can you hold on?</b>

696
00:42:37,271 --> 00:42:39,740
<b>But I won't be repeating the same thing.</b>

697
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:40,940
<b>I might cover the same news,</b>

698
00:42:40,942 --> 00:42:44,305
<b>but the anchors are different and mine starts late at night.</b>

699
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:46,610
<b>Since your character works for the 9pm news,</b>

700
00:42:46,614 --> 00:42:49,475
<b>it'll help you more if you watch the 9pm news.</b>

701
00:42:52,186 --> 00:42:54,815
<b>Ha Jin found out...</b>

702
00:42:55,056 --> 00:42:56,715
<b>about your disease.</b>

703
00:42:57,758 --> 00:43:00,860
<b>Then when will you read the 9pm news?</b>

704
00:43:00,861 --> 00:43:03,325
<b>I heard that's the main one.</b>

705
00:43:03,764 --> 00:43:07,995
<b>I'm not sure. That's not up to me.</b>

706
00:43:08,135 --> 00:43:09,965
<b>I've never considered it either.</b>

707
00:43:10,605 --> 00:43:14,435
<b>Not anyone can do the 9pm news.</b>

708
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,275
<b>Since when were you there?</b>

709
00:43:23,184 --> 00:43:25,110
<b>I had a food coma and was napping.</b>

710
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:27,020
<b>What? Was I not allowed to?</b>

711
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:28,680
<b>I didn't see you at all.</b>

712
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:31,050
<b>You probably couldn't.</b>

713
00:43:31,058 --> 00:43:33,220
<b>You were busy pulling each other...</b>

714
00:43:33,227 --> 00:43:35,355
<b>closer.</b>

715
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:37,730
<b>You were too busy being lovey-dovey...</b>

716
00:43:37,732 --> 00:43:39,430
<b>to notice me.</b>

717
00:43:39,433 --> 00:43:41,160
<b>We were neither pulling each other closer...</b>

718
00:43:41,168 --> 00:43:42,900
<b>nor being lovey-dovey.</b>

719
00:43:42,903 --> 00:43:44,270
<b>We were only talking about the news.</b>

720
00:43:44,271 --> 00:43:46,870
<b>Right, I'm sure.</b>

721
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:50,240
<b>You must be professionals.</b>

722
00:43:50,244 --> 00:43:53,280
<b>Out of all the great places to date,</b>

723
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,380
<b>you picked this busy workplace...</b>

724
00:43:55,383 --> 00:43:58,550
<b>to act all lovey-dovey.</b>

725
00:43:58,552 --> 00:44:00,115
<b>- Wait. - Right.</b>

726
00:44:02,189 --> 00:44:03,985
<b>Let me clear something.</b>

727
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:08,320
<b>I'm the one who's in charge of the articles for his news.</b>

728
00:44:08,329 --> 00:44:11,090
<b>I'm the one who decides what to omit and what to dig deeper.</b>

729
00:44:11,098 --> 00:44:12,695
<b>Got it?</b>

730
00:44:13,768 --> 00:44:15,865
<b>After all, I'm his boss.</b>

731
00:44:16,303 --> 00:44:18,995
<b>Make sure you write them all down.</b>

732
00:44:19,407 --> 00:44:23,735
<b>Look at you acting all cool in front of your girlfriend.</b>

733
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:28,780
<b>What's wrong with him?</b>

734
00:44:28,783 --> 00:44:31,445
<b>I have no idea either.</b>

735
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:37,190
<b>What are you writing so secretively?</b>

736
00:44:37,191 --> 00:44:39,015
<b>Nothing.</b>

737
00:44:41,529 --> 00:44:43,890
<b>I'd like two cups of Americano, to go, please.</b>

738
00:44:43,898 --> 00:44:44,890
<b>That'll be nine dollars.</b>

739
00:44:44,899 --> 00:44:46,430
<b>How was it today?</b>

740
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:48,630
<b>Was he nice enough to explain everything?</b>

741
00:44:48,636 --> 00:44:51,830
<b>Yes, he was. But I'm going to come again tomorrow.</b>

742
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:54,240
<b>Why would you? Wasn't today enough?</b>

743
00:44:54,241 --> 00:44:56,670
<b>What's wrong? I'm free tomorrow.</b>

744
00:44:56,677 --> 00:44:57,910
<b>It's good to be thorough.</b>

745
00:44:57,912 --> 00:44:59,745
<b>That's true.</b>

746
00:45:00,514 --> 00:45:02,710
<b>By the way, how many cups of coffee do we need?</b>

747
00:45:02,717 --> 00:45:04,510
<b>- I want a chocolate drink. - No.</b>

748
00:45:04,518 --> 00:45:06,115
<b>Hold on.</b>

749
00:45:06,253 --> 00:45:08,620
<b>Hello? You may speak.</b>

750
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:11,990
<b>Hey, don't even talk about Anchor Lee. He irritates me.</b>

751
00:45:11,992 --> 00:45:14,790
<b>He thinks he owns the broadcasting station.</b>

752
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:17,755
<b>This time, he even invited his girlfriend over.</b>

753
00:45:17,898 --> 00:45:20,665
<b>It was ridiculous.</b>

754
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:24,970
<b>I can't take it.</b>

755
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:26,940
<b>Can you send me the tentative proposal?</b>

756
00:45:26,941 --> 00:45:29,005
<b>- I need to go to the toilet. - Okay.</b>

757
00:45:39,253 --> 00:45:40,845
<b>Oh, my.</b>

758
00:45:41,055 --> 00:45:42,180
<b>When did you come?</b>

759
00:45:42,189 --> 00:45:44,090
<b>Just now. You can finish writing.</b>

760
00:45:44,091 --> 00:45:46,720
<b>That's fine. I'm all done.</b>

761
00:45:46,727 --> 00:45:49,590
<b>I hope I'm not taking too much of your time.</b>

762
00:45:49,597 --> 00:45:52,695
<b>Don't worry. I have all the time in the world.</b>

763
00:45:59,206 --> 00:46:02,635
<b>Isn't that your team leader?</b>

764
00:46:17,124 --> 00:46:19,120
<b>What was that?</b>

765
00:46:19,126 --> 00:46:20,420
<b>Oh, no.</b>

766
00:46:20,427 --> 00:46:22,690
<b>I'm so sorry. I thought you were my manager.</b>

767
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:26,530
<b>Even still, why would you slap your manager's head like this?</b>

768
00:46:26,534 --> 00:46:29,170
<b>Oh, no! Oh, no!</b>

769
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:30,530
<b>You two have similar-looking heads.</b>

770
00:46:30,538 --> 00:46:32,030
<b>I'm sorry. That must've hurt.</b>

771
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:33,070
<b>It's fine.</b>

772
00:46:33,073 --> 00:46:34,300
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

773
00:46:34,308 --> 00:46:35,865
<b>It's okay.</b>

774
00:46:41,916 --> 00:46:43,550
<b>Hello.</b>

775
00:46:43,551 --> 00:46:47,715
<b>I'm Jeong Hoon's mom. It's nice to meet you.</b>

776
00:46:49,123 --> 00:46:50,950
<b>Hello, it's nice to meet you.</b>

777
00:46:50,958 --> 00:46:52,585
<b>Me too.</b>

778
00:46:52,693 --> 00:46:54,590
<b>Have you eaten already?</b>

779
00:46:54,595 --> 00:46:56,830
<b>Do you want to join us for dinner?</b>

780
00:46:56,831 --> 00:46:59,255
<b>We're going to have something nice.</b>

781
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:01,425
<b>Come with us.</b>

782
00:47:07,374 --> 00:47:08,770
<b>Do you want some hand cream?</b>

783
00:47:08,776 --> 00:47:10,240
<b>- Hand cream? - Do this.</b>

784
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:11,935
<b>This?</b>

785
00:47:12,947 --> 00:47:15,175
<b>Do it like this.</b>

786
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:18,145
<b>Doesn't it smell nice?</b>

787
00:47:18,786 --> 00:47:21,080
<b>The food's already here.</b>

788
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:23,350
<b>You're right. That was quick.</b>

789
00:47:23,357 --> 00:47:26,090
<b>Jeong Hoon, listen to this.</b>

790
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:31,255
<b>Ha Jin said she slapped your team leader on purpose.</b>

791
00:47:31,665 --> 00:47:33,865
<b>She said he was being so annoying.</b>

792
00:47:34,001 --> 00:47:37,170
<b>You told me about him before.</b>

793
00:47:37,171 --> 00:47:40,200
<b>Is he really that bad?</b>

794
00:47:40,207 --> 00:47:42,400
<b>You'll understand me once you get to know him.</b>

795
00:47:42,409 --> 00:47:44,770
<b>He's so pesky.</b>

796
00:47:44,778 --> 00:47:48,510
<b>It must've felt great to slap him.</b>

797
00:47:48,515 --> 00:47:51,815
<b>Extremely. I was waiting for my chance.</b>

798
00:47:52,753 --> 00:47:54,250
<b>I think you have a call.</b>

799
00:47:54,255 --> 00:47:56,215
<b>Oh, excuse me.</b>

800
00:47:58,192 --> 00:48:01,225
<b>It's my sister. I'll be back.</b>

801
00:48:04,832 --> 00:48:07,865
<b>She's so cheerful.</b>

802
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:11,195
<b>I bet she makes everyone around her laugh a lot.</b>

803
00:48:11,372 --> 00:48:13,870
<b>I haven't seen you laugh this much in a long time.</b>

804
00:48:13,874 --> 00:48:15,640
<b>Really?</b>

805
00:48:15,643 --> 00:48:20,705
<b>Then don't you think it'd be nice to meet up like this more often?</b>

806
00:48:22,383 --> 00:48:23,780
<b>Are you sure you're all right?</b>

807
00:48:23,784 --> 00:48:26,350
<b>I'm totally fine.</b>

808
00:48:26,353 --> 00:48:30,185
<b>When you become my age, every day becomes boring.</b>

809
00:48:30,257 --> 00:48:33,015
<b>You know you can't lie to me.</b>

810
00:48:33,093 --> 00:48:34,825
<b>What is it?</b>

811
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:38,425
<b>Later.</b>

812
00:48:38,666 --> 00:48:40,895
<b>I'll tell you everything later.</b>

813
00:48:41,235 --> 00:48:45,495
<b>I've always kept my word.</b>

814
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,265
<b>I promise...</b>

815
00:48:48,642 --> 00:48:50,635
<b>to tell you later.</b>

816
00:48:50,744 --> 00:48:52,335
<b>Really.</b>

817
00:48:56,116 --> 00:48:57,975
<b>Okay. Let's eat.</b>

818
00:49:00,821 --> 00:49:04,790
<b>Gosh, it's been a while since I had steak.</b>

819
00:49:04,792 --> 00:49:07,325
<b>Wait. I'll cut it for you.</b>

820
00:49:08,262 --> 00:49:11,355
<b>Yes. I'm having a meal with Anchor Lee and his mother.</b>

821
00:49:11,999 --> 00:49:14,625
<b>No, it's not uncomfortable at all.</b>

822
00:49:14,668 --> 00:49:17,065
<b>She's really nice.</b>

823
00:49:17,538 --> 00:49:20,340
<b>Okay. I'll be back soon.</b>

824
00:49:20,341 --> 00:49:22,070
<b>Okay. I got it.</b>

825
00:49:22,076 --> 00:49:23,635
<b>Okay.</b>

826
00:49:30,317 --> 00:49:32,045
<b>Here you go.</b>

827
00:49:38,859 --> 00:49:40,990
<b>I had such a nice meal thanks to you.</b>

828
00:49:40,995 --> 00:49:43,190
<b>Please let me treat you to a meal next time.</b>

829
00:49:43,197 --> 00:49:44,590
<b>Will you?</b>

830
00:49:44,598 --> 00:49:47,760
<b>Then, I should have a really expensive meal then.</b>

831
00:49:47,768 --> 00:49:50,195
<b>Please do. I have a lot of money.</b>

832
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:54,605
<b>I'm laughing a lot thanks to you today.</b>

833
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:56,870
<b>Let me.</b>

834
00:49:56,877 --> 00:49:57,870
<b>Okay.</b>

835
00:49:57,878 --> 00:50:00,480
<b>I have a way with scarves.</b>

836
00:50:00,481 --> 00:50:01,940
<b>I know about ten different ways of wearing them.</b>

837
00:50:01,949 --> 00:50:04,845
<b>And I'll use the most beautiful way of wearing a scarf.</b>

838
00:50:04,918 --> 00:50:07,385
<b>I should learn them from you sometime.</b>

839
00:50:08,622 --> 00:50:10,520
<b>There you go.</b>

840
00:50:10,524 --> 00:50:14,290
<b>I see. I didn't know you could wear it like this.</b>

841
00:50:14,294 --> 00:50:16,025
<b>This looks beautiful.</b>

842
00:50:16,330 --> 00:50:19,825
<b>Jeong Hoon, what do you think? Doesn't this look nice?</b>

843
00:50:20,134 --> 00:50:23,270
<b>Is it any different? They look all the same to me.</b>

844
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:25,070
<b>My goodness.</b>

845
00:50:25,072 --> 00:50:28,635
<b>This is why having a son is no fun.</b>

846
00:50:28,809 --> 00:50:33,010
<b>Ha Jin, do you want to take a photo with me?</b>

847
00:50:33,013 --> 00:50:34,910
<b>It would look really nice if we take it over there.</b>

848
00:50:34,915 --> 00:50:37,115
<b>Yes. Sounds great.</b>

849
00:50:44,258 --> 00:50:45,890
<b>- What are you doing? - What are you doing?</b>

850
00:50:45,893 --> 00:50:48,225
<b>You're the photographer.</b>

851
00:50:48,529 --> 00:50:50,790
<b>I was the photographer?</b>

852
00:50:50,798 --> 00:50:52,995
<b>- Of course. - Of course.</b>

853
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:01,570
<b>All right.</b>

854
00:51:01,575 --> 00:51:04,635
<b>In 1, 2, 3.</b>

855
00:51:05,112 --> 00:51:06,110
<b>Ta-da.</b>

856
00:51:06,113 --> 00:51:08,810
<b>If you want, I'd love to take a photo for you guys.</b>

857
00:51:08,816 --> 00:51:11,880
<b>Yes. That sounds great. Please take a photo of us.</b>

858
00:51:11,885 --> 00:51:13,380
<b>Jeong Hoon, come over here.</b>

859
00:51:13,387 --> 00:51:14,945
<b>Hurry.</b>

860
00:51:17,724 --> 00:51:19,720
<b>I'll take it now.</b>

861
00:51:19,726 --> 00:51:22,325
<b>In 1, 2, 3.</b>

862
00:51:28,469 --> 00:51:29,870
<b>We have to mark the spot for surgery tomorrow,</b>

863
00:51:29,870 --> 00:51:32,300
<b>so you have an endoscopy.</b>

864
00:51:32,306 --> 00:51:35,070
<b>You can't leave the hospital without permission again like today.</b>

865
00:51:35,075 --> 00:51:36,170
<b>You know that, right?</b>

866
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:37,940
<b>Okay.</b>

867
00:51:37,945 --> 00:51:40,210
<b>I don't need to leave the hospital now.</b>

868
00:51:40,214 --> 00:51:41,975
<b>I'll believe you.</b>

869
00:51:42,649 --> 00:51:43,910
<b>I haven't seen many patients...</b>

870
00:51:43,917 --> 00:51:45,880
<b>getting surgery after going through stage four chemotherapy.</b>

871
00:51:45,886 --> 00:51:47,680
<b>That's really impressive.</b>

872
00:51:47,688 --> 00:51:50,220
<b>You just need this surgery to go well.</b>

873
00:51:50,224 --> 00:51:52,350
<b>Hang in there a bit more.</b>

874
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:54,955
<b>Okay. Thank you.</b>

875
00:52:14,348 --> 00:52:15,580
<b>You ate a lot today.</b>

876
00:52:15,582 --> 00:52:17,280
<b>Shouldn't we go for a run before going to sleep?</b>

877
00:52:17,284 --> 00:52:19,050
<b>I'll do it if you let me eat late-night snacks.</b>

878
00:52:19,052 --> 00:52:20,280
<b>What?</b>

879
00:52:20,287 --> 00:52:23,620
<b>Do I need to come tomorrow at the same time as today?</b>

880
00:52:23,624 --> 00:52:25,990
<b>Well, I'll just drive her around.</b>

881
00:52:25,993 --> 00:52:27,790
<b>- Take a day off tomorrow. - Okay.</b>

882
00:52:27,794 --> 00:52:28,920
<b>You'll be back after the news, right?</b>

883
00:52:28,929 --> 00:52:30,160
<b>Yes, I should.</b>

884
00:52:30,164 --> 00:52:31,490
<b>Good job today. Go home now.</b>

885
00:52:31,498 --> 00:52:33,460
<b>Okay. Call me if you have a problem.</b>

886
00:52:33,467 --> 00:52:35,165
<b>Okay. Bye.</b>

887
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:37,600
<b>I want fried chicken.</b>

888
00:52:37,604 --> 00:52:39,000
<b>Go get changed.</b>

889
00:52:39,006 --> 00:52:40,865
<b>Where? To go for a run.</b>

890
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:03,255
<b>Be careful.</b>

891
00:53:05,399 --> 00:53:08,595
<b>I think I dropped it somewhere over here.</b>

892
00:53:40,534 --> 00:53:42,095
<b>(Anchor Lee's Day)</b>

893
00:53:43,503 --> 00:53:44,730
<b>(Anchor Lee usually listens during the meeting.)</b>

894
00:53:44,738 --> 00:53:46,000
<b>(After the meeting, he checks articles and writes lines.)</b>

895
00:53:46,006 --> 00:53:49,205
<b>(He always uses the same pen when he works.)</b>

896
00:54:09,096 --> 00:54:12,390
<b>He always uses the same pen when he works.</b>

897
00:54:12,399 --> 00:54:16,525
<b>Look at you acting all cool in front of your girlfriend.</b>

898
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:18,270
<b>What's wrong with him?</b>

899
00:54:18,272 --> 00:54:20,965
<b>I have no idea either.</b>

900
00:54:23,277 --> 00:54:24,810
<b>What are you writing so secretively?</b>

901
00:54:24,811 --> 00:54:26,735
<b>Nothing.</b>

902
00:54:26,747 --> 00:54:30,050
<b>The person that annoys him the most is Team Leader Kim Chul Woong.</b>

903
00:54:30,050 --> 00:54:33,145
<b>I can tell that he's thinking about punching the guy.</b>

904
00:54:34,388 --> 00:54:36,180
<b>Then, what should I do?</b>

905
00:54:36,189 --> 00:54:37,890
<b>Are you asking me because you don't know?</b>

906
00:54:37,891 --> 00:54:40,485
<b>Or because you're testing me to see if I can get it right?</b>

907
00:54:40,994 --> 00:54:42,785
<b>Of course, I know what to do.</b>

908
00:54:42,796 --> 00:54:46,055
<b>He hates it the most when people ask him what they should do.</b>

909
00:55:15,362 --> 00:55:18,555
<b>After having lunch, he always drinks an Americano.</b>

910
00:55:30,811 --> 00:55:31,910
<b>When he's done with the news,</b>

911
00:55:31,912 --> 00:55:35,075
<b>he stays in the green room and is the last one to leave.</b>

912
00:55:35,849 --> 00:55:38,815
<b>He looks so lonely when he's alone.</b>

913
00:55:52,566 --> 00:55:54,225
<b>You're here.</b>

914
00:55:54,401 --> 00:55:56,265
<b>Let's talk.</b>

915
00:56:08,281 --> 00:56:10,610
<b>Where did you find that?</b>

916
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:13,215
<b>I looked everywhere, but I couldn't find it.</b>

917
00:56:19,893 --> 00:56:22,955
<b>Did you read this?</b>

918
00:56:25,899 --> 00:56:27,760
<b>I was just...</b>

919
00:56:27,768 --> 00:56:30,635
<b>Don't get the wrong idea. It didn't mean anything.</b>

920
00:56:31,238 --> 00:56:33,170
<b>I hope you're not upset.</b>

921
00:56:33,173 --> 00:56:34,700
<b>I won't get the wrong idea.</b>

922
00:56:34,708 --> 00:56:36,505
<b>And I'm not upset either.</b>

923
00:56:37,577 --> 00:56:40,445
<b>I'm just uncomfortable about this kind of situation.</b>

924
00:56:40,847 --> 00:56:42,740
<b>I hate that you're walking on eggshells around me...</b>

925
00:56:42,749 --> 00:56:44,915
<b>because of my condition.</b>

926
00:56:46,253 --> 00:56:48,515
<b>I've had this condition for a long time.</b>

927
00:56:48,688 --> 00:56:51,055
<b>And I'm used to this.</b>

928
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:53,955
<b>So you don't need to try hard for my sake.</b>

929
00:56:54,761 --> 00:56:56,955
<b>I wasn't trying hard.</b>

930
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:01,595
<b>To be honest, when I found out about your condition,</b>

931
00:57:02,035 --> 00:57:05,795
<b>I just thought that I got to know you a bit more.</b>

932
00:57:06,072 --> 00:57:08,835
<b>That's not true. It got harder.</b>

933
00:57:09,643 --> 00:57:11,570
<b>I studied and kept thinking about it,</b>

934
00:57:11,578 --> 00:57:14,305
<b>but I still don't know...</b>

935
00:57:15,015 --> 00:57:19,045
<b>how it must feel to live with all the memories one has.</b>

936
00:57:22,022 --> 00:57:24,715
<b>On one side, I'm jealous.</b>

937
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:27,555
<b>And on the other side, I feel bad.</b>

938
00:57:30,464 --> 00:57:33,830
<b>I'm sorry. I won't write notes if this upsets you.</b>

939
00:57:33,834 --> 00:57:36,225
<b>But please don't misunderstand my intention.</b>

940
00:57:36,336 --> 00:57:39,535
<b>I'm doing this for me, not for you.</b>

941
00:57:41,374 --> 00:57:43,405
<b>I can forget about other things,</b>

942
00:57:44,211 --> 00:57:48,075
<b>but I really want to remember everything about you.</b>

943
00:57:49,349 --> 00:57:52,045
<b>I don't want to forget anything when it comes to you.</b>

944
00:58:30,323 --> 00:58:33,015
<b>Why isn't he answering his phone?</b>

945
00:58:37,163 --> 00:58:39,295
<b>Why are you still here?</b>

946
00:58:39,332 --> 00:58:41,330
<b>Chul was supposed to come, but he's not coming.</b>

947
00:58:41,334 --> 00:58:43,295
<b>And he's not answering either.</b>

948
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:44,600
<b>What about your sister?</b>

949
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:47,840
<b>She left earlier because she had an important meeting.</b>

950
00:58:47,841 --> 00:58:50,265
<b>That's why Chul was supposed to come.</b>

951
00:58:51,311 --> 00:58:53,505
<b>Chul must be here.</b>

952
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:55,575
<b>Hey, Chul.</b>

953
00:58:56,683 --> 00:58:59,675
<b>What? Why can't you come? Where are you?</b>

954
00:59:00,921 --> 00:59:03,445
<b>Okay. I understand.</b>

955
00:59:03,890 --> 00:59:05,885
<b>No, I'll manage.</b>

956
00:59:06,293 --> 00:59:07,855
<b>Okay.</b>

957
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:11,830
<b>Hop in. I'll give you a ride.</b>

958
00:59:11,831 --> 00:59:13,700
<b>It's okay. I'll take a taxi.</b>

959
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:16,965
<b>My friend got hospitalized, so I have to go to the hospital.</b>

960
00:59:17,404 --> 00:59:18,965
<b>Get in.</b>

961
00:59:24,544 --> 00:59:25,540
<b>Thank you.</b>

962
00:59:25,545 --> 00:59:28,080
<b>I'm sorry you had to do this instead of going home.</b>

963
00:59:28,081 --> 00:59:29,805
<b>It's okay.</b>

964
00:59:29,983 --> 00:59:33,515
<b>Does he break his promise very often? Your manager, I mean.</b>

965
00:59:33,687 --> 00:59:36,120
<b>Oh, we told him before to take today off,</b>

966
00:59:36,122 --> 00:59:38,490
<b>so I guess he was hanging out somewhere far away.</b>

967
00:59:38,491 --> 00:59:41,025
<b>He's usually not like that. He's very diligent.</b>

968
00:59:41,595 --> 00:59:42,990
<b>Really?</b>

969
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:44,555
<b>Right.</b>

970
00:59:45,031 --> 00:59:48,265
<b>Ta-da. I bought this. Your mother's poetry book.</b>

971
00:59:49,769 --> 00:59:51,600
<b>That was published a while ago. How did you find it?</b>

972
00:59:51,605 --> 00:59:54,735
<b>I got curious and looked for it right away as soon as I met her.</b>

973
00:59:54,741 --> 00:59:57,110
<b>I don't know much about poetry, but I loved it.</b>

974
00:59:57,110 --> 00:59:58,840
<b>I instantly became her fan.</b>

975
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:02,305
<b>If I get to meet her again, I'll ask her for an autograph.</b>

976
01:00:03,183 --> 01:00:04,780
<b>She'll be thrilled.</b>

977
01:00:04,784 --> 01:00:07,150
<b>She looks a lot like you.</b>

978
01:00:07,153 --> 01:00:09,085
<b>Especially the way you smile.</b>

979
01:00:09,756 --> 01:00:13,055
<b>I'm sure you only have good memories of her.</b>

980
01:00:14,828 --> 01:00:16,425
<b>You're right.</b>

981
01:00:16,963 --> 01:00:18,925
<b>She always...</b>

982
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:22,225
<b>gave me nothing but good memories since when I was a kid.</b>

<b>Thank you for the ride. Go home safely.</b>

985
01:00:31,311 --> 01:00:33,005
<b>Will you be all right by yourself?</b>

986
01:00:33,513 --> 01:00:35,675
<b>There are a lot of people.</b>

987
01:00:42,088 --> 01:00:43,745

<b>Can you fix my disease?</b>

993

<b>Anchor Lee, time can't help you.</b>

994
01:02:23,590 --> 01:02:25,450
<b>Just keep your eyes on him.</b>

995

<b>Keep my eyes on him?</b>

<b>She wanted this.</b>

<b>She felt too bad for you.</b>

1000

<b>She did this out of love.</b>

1001
