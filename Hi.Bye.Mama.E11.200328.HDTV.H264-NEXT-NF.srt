<b>HI BYE, MAMA!</b>

2

<b>-You want to do what?
-Do one favor for each other.</b>

3
00:00:11,821 --> 00:00:14,615
<b>We might not have time
for each other once our baby's born.</b>

4

<b>We should enjoy our newlywed status

5
00:00:19,662 --> 00:00:22,498
<b>I wasn't joking.
Just tell me, and I'll do it for you.</b>

6
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:23,457
<b>-Really?
-Of course.</b>

7
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:27,837
<b>Well, then
since it's a rare opportunity...</b>

8
00:00:28,421 --> 00:00:30,965
<b>I should really
put a lot of thought into it.</b>

9
00:00:33,134 --> 00:00:34,593
<b>Pick me up on a rainy day.</b>

10
00:00:34,677 --> 00:00:35,886
<b>What? That's it?</b>

11
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:37,430
<b>"That's it"?</b>

12
00:00:37,847 --> 00:00:39,140
<b>When I was little,</b>

13
00:00:39,223 --> 00:00:41,809
<b>mothers would come to school
with umbrellas on a rainy day.</b>

14
00:00:41,892 --> 00:00:44,311
<b>I envied the other kids so much
because my mom never came.</b>

15
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:47,857
<b>Why are you telling me
such a sad story so suddenly?</b>

16
00:00:48,357 --> 00:00:50,401
<b>She had no choice since she was working.</b>

17
00:00:51,068 --> 00:00:52,319
<b>All right. I'll do that.</b>

18
00:00:52,695 --> 00:00:54,071
<b>Really? You'll do that for me?</b>

19
00:00:54,155 --> 00:00:56,323
<b>Of course. That's a piece of cake.</b>

20
00:00:56,407 --> 00:00:58,492
<b>I'll go pick you up whenever it rains.</b>

21
00:00:58,576 --> 00:01:00,161
<b>You shouldn't say that so easily.</b>

22

<b>It's raining almost like a rainy season
these days. Are you sure you'll be okay?</b>

23
00:01:03,664 --> 00:01:06,625
<b>-Of course.
-Okay. Your turn, then.</b>

24

25
00:01:08,878 --> 00:01:11,172
<b>I'll give you anything you want.
What do you want?</b>

26
00:01:11,338 --> 00:01:13,424
<b>I don't really want much.</b>

27
00:01:13,966 --> 00:01:15,676

28

29

30
00:01:26,353 --> 00:01:27,730
<b>I enjoyed spending time with you.</b>

31
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,777
<b>I hope you live a happy life.</b>

32

33

34
00:02:04,058 --> 00:02:05,601

35

<b>My gosh.</b>

36
00:02:19,073 --> 00:02:21,784
<b><i>Honey, I feel so heavy today.</i></b>

37
00:02:22,201 --> 00:02:24,161
<b><i>Can we just skip today?</i></b>

38
00:02:27,289 --> 00:02:28,582
<b>Of course.</b>

39
00:02:49,645 --> 00:02:51,480
<b>My husband! You're here.</b>

40
00:02:51,564 --> 00:02:53,649
<b>-My wife.
-Yes.</b>

41
00:02:53,732 --> 00:02:58,237
<b>I thought you were going to
pick me up whenever it rains.</b>

42
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,614
<b>I really was about to go,</b>

43
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:03,367

44
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:06,537
<b>Oh, did you? It's fine.</b>

45
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,789
<b>You shouldn't come out.
You should take care of yourself.</b>

<b>Oh, you're so wet.</b>

47
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:13,043
<b>Yes, I'm totally soaked.</b>

48
00:03:13,127 --> 00:03:14,753
<b>You're right. You're all soaked.</b>

49
00:03:14,837 --> 00:03:19,383
<b>Maybe our Yeol-mu said
you should go pick me up,</b>

50
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:21,427
<b>-but you...
-No, I...</b>

51
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:25,139
<b><i>Back then, each day arrived so naturally</i></b>

52
00:03:25,764 --> 00:03:28,434
<b><i>that I thought it was obvious
for the next day to arrive.</i></b>

53
00:03:28,517 --> 00:03:30,561
<b>You fed our sleeping baby
so many tangerines again?</b>

54
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:32,062
<b>Our baby really likes tangerines.</b>

55
00:03:40,237 --> 00:03:41,530
<b>-Honey.
-Oh, Honey!</b>

56
00:03:42,114 --> 00:03:43,699
<b>-You came to pick me up?
-Yes.</b>

57
00:03:43,782 --> 00:03:46,243
<b>-Really? Thank you.
-Of course.</b>

58
00:04:02,092 --> 00:04:06,180

<b>-Exorcist?
-Exorcist?</b>

170
00:12:23,301 --> 00:12:26,263
<b>My gosh. What should I do?</b>

171
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:29,474

<b><i>You know,</i></b>

173
00:12:35,147 --> 00:12:37,691
<b><i>the civil servant

<b>You're dead, so you should go up now.</b>

175
00:12:41,653 --> 00:12:43,405
<b>Hand in hand with your friends.</b>

176
00:12:44,781 --> 00:12:47,617
<b><i>He just sent up every ghost he saw
without giving them a chance.</i></b>

177
00:12:47,701 --> 00:12:49,327
<b><i>So he has a success rate of 99.9 percent.</i></b>

178
00:12:49,578 --> 00:12:52,289
<b><i>Since he took over Gangnam,
Gangdong, and Gangseo-gu,</i></b>

179
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:53,999
<b><i>all the ghosts have been annihilated.</i></b>

180

<b>-We should run!
-Go! Hurry!</b>

182

<b>Are these rubber shoes or what?</b>

183

<b>What is a successful elite exorcist

187

<b>Do you really not know?</b>

188
00:13:31,119 --> 00:13:34,122
<b>Why would an exorcist with
a 99.9 percent success rate</b>

189
00:13:34,206 --> 00:13:38,502
<b>be sent to a cinerarium
with a zero percent success rate?</b>

190
00:13:39,544 --> 00:13:40,879
<b>Why do you think they've sent me?</b>

191
00:13:42,547 --> 00:13:43,924
<b>It's not zero percent.</b>

192
00:13:44,007 --> 00:13:46,301
<b>I sent up two people a few days ago.</b>

193
00:13:46,384 --> 00:13:48,845
<b>Wow, that is so amazing.</b>

194
00:13:49,846 --> 00:13:51,348
<b>You sent as many as two people?</b>

195

<b>That's two in ten years. Isn't that right?</b>

196

<b>LEDGER</b>

197

<b>You couldn't even send up

<b>reset their lives?</b>

200
00:14:10,158 --> 00:14:11,952
<b>I'm at a loss for words.</b>

201

-Why?</b>

346

<b>Hyeon-jeong.</b>

613
00:43:33,907 --> 00:43:36,618
<b>Hyeon-jeong, wait. Hold on.
Let's talk about this.</b>

614
00:43:36,701 --> 00:43:39,370
<b>Hyeon-jeong!</b>

615
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,873
<b>I'm playing with your mom.</b>

616
00:43:42,415 --> 00:43:44,709
<b>Go over there and play with your friends.</b>

617
00:43:46,544 --> 00:43:48,671
<b>My goodness. What is this? Oh, no.</b>

618
00:43:50,006 --> 00:43:51,299
<b>Goodness.</b>

619
00:43:52,842 --> 00:43:54,886
<b>Hey! You!</b>

620
00:43:57,138 --> 00:44:01,267
<b>My gosh. It hurts! Hey, I'm on your side!</b>

621
00:44:02,769 --> 00:44:04,813
<b>What is it? Oh, no.</b>

622
00:44:05,772 --> 00:44:07,315
<b>-No!
-Hey!</b>

623
00:45:27,221 --> 00:45:30,557
<b>Did you see their faces?
We totally destroyed them.</b>

624
00:45:31,558 --> 00:45:33,852
<b>Look at us.
I can't believe you two fought them.</b>

625
00:45:33,936 --> 00:45:34,978
<b>Really?</b>

626
00:45:35,479 --> 00:45:37,564
<b>You had Mi-so's mom in a headlock.</b>

627
00:45:37,648 --> 00:45:38,690
<b>You almost killed her!</b>

628
00:45:38,774 --> 00:45:40,984
<b>No way.
That's not nearly enough to kill her.</b>

629
00:45:41,276 --> 00:45:43,904
<b>Min-jeong was amazing.
She used a baseball bat to beat them</b>

630
00:45:43,987 --> 00:45:45,489
<b>-with a blank look.
-Right.</b>

631
00:45:45,572 --> 00:45:48,075
<b>It wasn't a real baseball bat.
It was a toy.</b>

632
00:45:48,158 --> 00:45:49,034
<b>-No way.
-My gosh.</b>

633
00:45:49,117 --> 00:45:50,244
<b>It was enough to kill people.</b>

634
00:45:50,327 --> 00:45:51,912
<b>-You swung it big like this.
-Right.</b>

635
00:45:53,288 --> 00:45:55,374
<b>-I thought Chi-in's mom was going to die.
-Same here.</b>

636
00:45:55,874 --> 00:45:57,292
<b>But that felt nice.</b>

637
00:45:57,876 --> 00:45:59,127
<b>I thought she was our sidekick,</b>

638
00:45:59,211 --> 00:46:01,171
<b>-but she was our boss.
-Exactly.</b>

639
00:46:01,255 --> 00:46:02,548
<b>The boss?</b>

640
00:46:02,631 --> 00:46:04,174
<b>The boss, the leader, and the head.</b>

641
00:46:04,967 --> 00:46:06,093
<b>Okay.</b>

642
00:46:06,969 --> 00:46:09,930
<b>You two had great teamwork
when we fought. Did you rehearse it?</b>

643
00:46:11,807 --> 00:46:15,018
<b>We fought even on our first encounter.</b>

644
00:46:15,519 --> 00:46:17,688
<b>A fan of Sechs Kies. A fan of H.O.T.</b>

645
00:46:19,481 --> 00:46:20,357
<b>Really?</b>

646
00:46:21,358 --> 00:46:23,360
<b>I don't think
you would have liked any idol groups.</b>

647
00:46:23,443 --> 00:46:24,695
<b>-Right.
-You only studied, right?</b>

648
00:46:24,778 --> 00:46:26,780
<b>I had a favorite too.</b>

649
00:46:26,864 --> 00:46:28,115
<b>-Who?
-Who?</b>

650
00:46:28,198 --> 00:46:29,575
<b>Hey, let go of me!</b>

651
00:46:29,658 --> 00:46:31,577
<b>-You let go first!
-It's mine!</b>

652
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:33,203
<b>-I picked it up first!
-Stop it!</b>

653
00:46:33,287 --> 00:46:35,163
<b>-I'm going to kill you.
-Let me go!</b>

654
00:46:35,247 --> 00:46:37,416
<b>-I'm going to tell everyone.
-Let go!</b>

655
00:46:37,499 --> 00:46:39,293
<b>-I got it first!
-They're on the cover!</b>

656
00:46:39,376 --> 00:46:40,627
<b>A lackey?</b>

657
00:46:41,587 --> 00:46:42,421
<b>Hey.</b>

658

<b>Hyeon-jeong is Guan Yu. She's the oldest.</b>

<b>Yes, sure. Congrats.</b>

663
00:46:57,769 --> 00:46:58,812
<b>Thanks.</b>

664
00:47:00,063 --> 00:47:02,065
<b>Darn it. Hey.</b>

665
00:47:04,318 --> 00:47:06,737
<b>Is it really okay to let them hang out?</b>

666
00:47:07,988 --> 00:47:10,616
<b>What will you do
when Min-jeong finds out later?</b>

667
00:47:14,995 --> 00:47:17,205
<b>She likes Hyeon-jeong and Yu-ri.</b>

668

<b>Min-jeong never liked someone this much.</b>

669

<b>How did things end up like this?</b>

670

<b>What do you think?</b>

671
00:47:33,972 --> 00:47:36,850
<b>Yu-ri begged us not to tell. That's why.</b>

672
00:47:38,602 --> 00:47:40,562
<b>Gosh, Hyeon-jeong doesn't say anything,</b>

673
00:47:41,146 --> 00:47:42,898
<b>but she's probably dying between them.</b>

674
00:47:42,981 --> 00:47:44,775
<b>She's so worried

<b>-Cheers!
-Cheers!</b>

<b>She's the nicest, so I feel really bad.</b>

<b>Hey, I need to use the restroom.</b>

682

<b>That's not the restroom.</b>

683
