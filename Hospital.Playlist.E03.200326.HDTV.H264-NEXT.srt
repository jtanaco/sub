<b>Dr. Ahn, Sang-u is here.</b>

3
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:48,130
<b>My goodness. Sang-u is here.</b>

4
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,760
<b>Sang-u, say hello to the doctor.</b>

5
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:53,180
<b>All right. There you go.</b>

6
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,140
<b>Sang-u, you came with a shark today.</b>

7
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:00,890
<b>Should I take a look
at what's inside the shark's mouth?</b>

8
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:02,940
<b>Oh, no.</b>

9
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:06,610
<b>Sang-u, why are you crying?</b>

10
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,070
<b>The doctor is going to ease
your stomachache.</b>

11
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:12,610
<b>He's trying to ease your stomachache.
Why are you crying?</b>

12
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:13,700
<b>Don't cry now.</b>

13
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:16,660
<b>If you keep crying,</b>

14

<b>this scary doctor is going to scold you
and give you a shot.</b>

15
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:22,750
<b>Right, doctor?</b>

16
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:26,080
<b>Bad boy! Where's the syringe?</b>

17
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:29,710
<b>Nurse, where is the big syringe
Sang-u is going to get?</b>

18
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,130
<b>Sang-u, be quiet. Stop crying.</b>

19
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:36,550
<b>If you keep crying, the doctor
is going to bring a big syringe.</b>

20
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:38,350
<b>Stop.</b>

21

<b>Let's see. I have some snacks
for Sang-u right here.</b>

23

<b>Who scared my sweet boy, Sang-u?</b>

24
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,120
<b>Was it the doctor?</b>

25
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,160
<b>It was the doctor, right?</b>

26
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,290
<b>I'll scold him for you.</b>

27
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,000
<b>There.</b>

28
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,170
<b>I scolded a bad doctor for you.</b>

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,920
<b>Doctor, why did you scare Sang-u?</b>

30
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,340
<b>He's such a nice boy.</b>

31
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:18,390
<b>Doctor, you won't scare Sang-u
anymore, right?</b>

32
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:19,970
<b>Right, doctor?</b>

33
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,850
<b>I am sorry, Sang-u.</b>

34
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,810
<b>I'll give you this snack
instead of a shot.</b>

35
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,270
<b>Eat this when you're all better.</b>

36

<b>-Yes.
-Professor Ahn.</b>

<b>Ji-su needs her PEG tube changed now.</b>

38

<b>-Excuse me for a second, Sang-u.
-Yes.</b>

39
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,750
<b>Hello.</b>

40
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:49,080
<b>I took a look at your ultrasound.</b>

41
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,880
<b>It will be difficult to treat
with antibiotics.</b>

42
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:56,380
<b>What does he have exactly?</b>

43
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,890
<b>He has infective endocarditis.</b>

44
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,140
<b>There's an infection in his endocardium.</b>

45
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:04,310
<b>If we treat it with antibiotics,
you may suffer from embolism.</b>

46
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,480
<b>I'm concerned an infected mass
might block your vessels.</b>

47
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,190
<b>You must get surgery as soon as possible.
Did you find him a bed?</b>

48
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,980
<b>Yes, he can get checked in after 6 p.m.</b>

49
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:14,860
<b>Check in today and let's book
the surgery as soon as we can.</b>

50
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,110
<b>-Is it serious?
-Yes.</b>

51
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,660
<b>If the infected mass is small,</b>

52
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,830
<b>antibiotics can be used to break it down.</b>

53
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:27,000
<b>From your ultrasound, the infected mass
is big and dangling.</b>

54
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,750
<b>We can't tell when it will fall off.</b>

55
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,170
<b>If it goes to the brain,
it causes a stroke.</b>

56
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,000
<b>If it goes to the heart,
it causes a heart attack.</b>

57
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:34,960
<b>You need to have surgery soon.</b>

58
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,670
<b>Do we have an opening for surgery
in two or three days?</b>

59
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,550
<b>No, we're full.
There's no opening this week.</b>

60
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,720
<b>We'll do it in the morning if we must.
Call Anesthesiology</b>

61
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:46,520
<b>and ask them to help me
with the surgery in two or three days.</b>

62
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,020
<b>Okay.</b>

63
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:52,560
<b>Doctor, my daughter
is getting married in three days.</b>

64
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,070
<b>Can we postpone the surgery
until next week?</b>

65
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:56,690
<b>No, we cannot.</b>

66
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,450
<b>It's only for a couple of days.</b>

67
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,870
<b>-Wouldn't that be okay?
-No.</b>

68
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:04,910
<b>Only if you want to end your life.</b>

69
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:08,370
<b>Dad, what are you talking about?
Don't be foolish.</b>

70
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,540
<b>My wedding isn't what's important now.</b>

71
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:12,960
<b>You can look at the wedding photos.</b>

72
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,670
<b>Ask her to take lots of photos.</b>

73
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:18,010
<b>Then I'll see you tomorrow
during my rounds.</b>

74
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:22,220
<b>Let me go over what you need to do.</b>

75
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,600
<b>First, head to the left
and have your blood sample drawn.</b>

76
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,560
<b>Why is that doctor so rude?</b>

77
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,940
<b>I am sorry. We are well aware of that.</b>

78
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:34,980
<b>Second, get an EKG from the room</b>

79
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,780
<b>right next to where you have
your blood sample drawn.</b>

80
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,150
<b>-And third...
-Well...</b>

81
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,780
<b>Aged 78. His name is Im Gi-yeong.</b>

82
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:44,450
<b>He underwent coiling a month ago
due to an SAH.</b>

83
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,790
<b>He showed symptoms of leg weakness
and dementia three days ago</b>

84
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,290
<b>so he was readmitted.</b>

85
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,710
<b>His CT scan revealed that
he has hydrocephalus.</b>

86
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:56,460
<b>It seems the IVH that was accompanied
by SAH is gone for now.</b>

87
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,460
<b>EVD...</b>

88
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:01,380
<b>That's not it. I'm sorry.</b>

89
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,390
<b>I think we should perform a VP shunt.</b>

90
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:07,930
<b>Shouldn't you have that memorized by now?</b>

91
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,770
<b>You're right.</b>

92
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,730
<b>-Are you sure he needs a VP shunt?
-Yes.</b>

93
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,440
<b>No.</b>

94
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,280
<b>-Is he wrong?
-Yes, I think so.</b>

95
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,200
<b>Really? I think he's right.</b>

96
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,450
<b>You have until my next round.</b>

97
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,870
<b>Prepare a summary of relevant papers
and surgical cases.</b>

98

<b>-Which one?
-A seafood stew restaurant.</b>

103
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,470
<b>That's too much for delivery food.</b>

104

<b>They also do a wonderful {i}haemulpajeon.{\i}</b>

-Hong-do and Yun-bok.</b>

00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:34,850
<b>Guys, listen up.</b>

157
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:37,930
<b>Great doctors like them

<b>You'll meet him soon.</b>

160

<b>-Yes, sir.
{i}-Where are you now?{\i}</b>

161
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:50,400
<b>I'm on my way.</b>

162
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,000
<b>-Will they perform the surgery here?
-Yes.</b>

163
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,460
<b>It's more dangerous to move the patient
to an OR with that many drips.</b>

164

<b>Are you Gyeon-u and Jik-nyeo?</b>

<b>-Third year in med school?
-Yes.</b>

167
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,190
<b>-Pay attention.
-Okay.</b>

168
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,070
<b>Professor,</b>

169
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:33,490
<b>-is this surgery difficult?
-The baby will live, right?</b>

170
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:36,370
<b>Four days ago, he had a TGA,
transposition of the great arteries.</b>

171
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,780
<b>His heart swelling was too severe.
I couldn't close him up.</b>

172
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:45,000
<b>Seeing his heart today, I might
be able to close him. So, I'll do it now.</b>

173
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,290
<b>He will live, right?</b>

174
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,250
<b>I'm closing him up
because he's doing better.</b>

175
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:52,340
<b>Jae-hak, bring them in.</b>

176
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:54,300
<b>Pardon?</b>

177
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:56,180
<b>I see. Okay.</b>

178
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:05,060
<b>What do you think you're doing?
You'll contaminate him.</b>

179
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:07,980
<b>Do you have a death wish?</b>

180
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,440
<b>He means the guardians.</b>

181
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,370
<b>Sir, Chan-hyeong has a slight fever.</b>

182
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,710
<b>Since when?</b>

183
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,580
<b>When I checked at 8 a.m., it was 36°C.</b>

184
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:31,630
<b>I checked again just now and it's
38.3°C. His nose is a little runny, too.</b>

185
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,970
<b>-Can we perform the surgery today?
-Let me see him.</b>

186
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:49,650
<b>His lung doesn't sound good, either.
We can't operate on him like this.</b>

187
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,860
<b>Give me five minutes.
Remove the membrane for me.</b>

188
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,440
<b>Can I touch the baby?</b>

189
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,900
<b>-I disinfected my hands.
-Okay.</b>

190
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,460
<b>What's wrong with this baby?</b>

191
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:10,420
<b>Jae-hak, get Chan-hyeong's guardians now.</b>

192
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:13,710
<b>He has Tetralogy of Fallot.
It's a congenital heart defect.</b>

193
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,170
<b>He has a ventricular septal defect,
pulmonary stenosis,</b>

194
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,930
<b>right ventricular hypertrophy,
and overriding aorta, all together.</b>

195
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:21,430
<b>We were scheduled to operate
this afternoon.</b>

196
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:24,100
<b>His oxygen saturation
is a little low, though.</b>

197
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,890
<b>He's showing symptoms of pneumonia.</b>

198
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,020
<b>He needs this surgery as soon as possible.</b>

199
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,150
<b>They are here.</b>

200
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,740
<b>Flex.</b>

201
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:43,940
<b>Flex.</b>

202
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,860
<b>I have bad news.</b>

203
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:54,570
<b>We need to postpone the surgery
by a day or two.</b>

204
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:57,330
<b>He has a fever
and his lung doesn't sound good.</b>

205
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:00,540
<b>I plan to reschedule after taking
an X-ray of his lungs.</b>

206
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,460
<b>He's still finding it hard to breathe.</b>

207
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:06,420
<b>He might be in more pain
if we rush into surgery.</b>

208
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,710
<b>We'll do that, then.</b>

209
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:13,260
<b>If it's a mild case of pneumonia,
he'll recover in two to three days.</b>

210
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,050
<b>We'll observe him for a few days.</b>

211
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,600
<b>Do you have any questions?</b>

212
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,470
<b>No.</b>

213
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,650
<b>You'll reschedule the surgery
and let us know, right?</b>

214
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:28,230
<b>We know. You explained already.</b>

215
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:30,530
<b>Okay, then.</b>

216
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:37,370
<b>My gosh, they seem so composed.
Their son's life is at stake.</b>

217
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:40,990
<b>They are just immature.
Did you see how young his mother is?</b>

218
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,160
<b>She was born in 2000.</b>

219
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,370
<b>I like that she's calm.</b>

220
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,090
<b>Do you think it's possible
that she's not herself right now</b>

221
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:51,090
<b>because of the pressure she's under
and she needs to escape from reality?</b>

222

<b>She's still very young.</b>

223
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:55,880
<b>Maybe she's having trouble

<b>-Jae-hak.
-Yes?</b>

<b>Why do you talk so much?</b>

<b>Mind your own business.</b>

227
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:05,980

<b>I don't know how he always got

<b>That's what kids today call

<b>We practiced all night

<b>And that jerk told us
on the day of the festival.</b>

291
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:30,140
<b>He said we weren't on the poster

<b>He's lucky he's a doctor.

00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:27,070
<b>Wasn't that your dog's name?</b>

589
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:29,780
<b>-That's Micky.
-Micky is your sister.</b>

590
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:31,740
<b>-My sister is Ik-sun.
-That's your dog.</b>

591
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:32,950
<b>My dog's name is Ik-sun.</b>

592
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,960
<b>No, my dog's name is Micky.
Micky is Ik-sun.</b>

593
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,670
<b>Damn it. You confused me.</b>

594
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,340
<b>My younger sister's name is Ik-sun.</b>

595
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,880
<b>Hey, what is this?</b>

596
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:47,010
<b>This is a recommendation letter
for priests.</b>

597
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:48,050
<b>Right?</b>

598
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:49,930
<b>-It's for real this time, right?
-Yes.</b>

599
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:51,720
<b>I feel bad for Jeong-won's mother.</b>

600
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,810
<b>Same. That jerk.</b>

601
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,980
<b>-Is it Jeong-won?
-No, it's my wife.</b>

602
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,520
<b>Your wife? You have a wife?</b>

603
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:01,270
<b>Yes, I have a wife.</b>

604
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,530
<b>The ambitious Ms. Yuk Hye-jeong?</b>

605
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:05,400
<b>She's so busy, I'll forget her face
pretty soon.</b>

606
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:06,320
<b>That's enough.</b>

607
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,990
<b>Hey, honey. It's been so long!</b>

608
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:11,660
<b>What time is it over there?</b>

609
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:13,580
<b>Okay.</b>

610
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:16,120
<b>Is your marathon course here?</b>

611
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:19,080
<b>-Tell me which hole this room counts as.
-Yes.</b>

612
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:22,130
<b>Okay.</b>

613
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:23,800
<b>-It's his wife.
-Okay.</b>

614
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:25,420
<b>-Really?
-Okay. Sure.</b>

615
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:27,340
<b>Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.</b>

616
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:29,760
<b>She's coming back tomorrow.</b>

617
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,640
<b>She's coming straight to the hospital
because she misses me.</b>

618
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,640
<b>It's because it's Children's Day
in two days.</b>

619
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:36,430
<b>-Has it been a year since you saw her?
-A year and a half.</b>

620
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:39,060
<b>She should've been here
for her mom's anniversary at least.</b>

621
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,810
<b>Whatever! That's not my business.</b>

622
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,480
<b>Gosh, Yuk Hye-jeong.</b>

623
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:46,110
<b>She's my friend
and I was the one who set him up with her.</b>

624
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:49,490
<b>I have never seen anyone
who is as ambitious as she is.</b>

625
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:51,910
<b>I've never seen you
badmouth anyone either.</b>

626
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:54,160
<b>Stop it. She's my wife.
And she's U-ju's mother.</b>

627
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,080
<b>The virgin and the bachelor
should shut it.</b>

628
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,080
<b>That's such an outdated term.
A "bachelor."</b>

629
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,620
<b>Hey, Jeong-won. What is this?</b>

630
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:07,090
<b>Are you really going to quit
to become a priest?</b>

631
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,180
<b>-Did you RSVP?
-Is that important right now?</b>

632
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:12,300
<b>Listen. If you...</b>

633
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:14,560
<b>Hey, Gyeo-ul.</b>

634
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,350
<b>Of course.
I collected a lot of those. Yes.</b>

635
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:20,440
<b>-Okay. I got it.
-When is it?</b>

636
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,350
<b>-Did you talk to the director?
-Okay.</b>

637
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,190
<b>I'll tell him next week.</b>

638
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:27,230
<b>I won't be leaving right away.</b>

639
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:29,950
<b>I'll stay until the end of the year
and resign then.</b>

640
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,870
<b>I'm going to go see Gyeo-ul.</b>

641
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:34,990
<b>Seriously. Wait.</b>

642
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:39,580
<b>Look over here. Look at the camera.</b>

643
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,830
<b>One, two, three.</b>

644
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:44,380
<b>-What was that?
-What are you doing?</b>

645
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:47,880
<b>Jeong-won will leave us soon.
We should leave lots of photos behind.</b>

646
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,920
<b>-Bye.
-What the...</b>

647
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:55,390
<b>Is he having an affair with Gyeo-ul?</b>

648
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,030
<b>Don't you have a photo of him alone?</b>

649
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:20,250
<b>Give me some time.
I'm waiting for the right time.</b>

650
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:22,670
<b>But Jeong-won catches on really fast.</b>

651
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:25,840
<b>Did you ask him about me?
What does he think of me?</b>

652
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:28,210
<b>-Not yet.
-Why not?</b>

653
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,880
<b>It'd be too obvious. Is that okay?</b>

654
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:33,130
<b>Yes. I don't mind.</b>

655
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:35,550
<b>So, please ask him what he thinks of me.</b>

656
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,810
<b>Why don't you tell him you like him then?</b>

657
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:41,180
<b>That's too...</b>

658
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,900
<b>-I'm too shy to do that.
-Gosh.</b>

659
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,520
<b>-But you're not shy talking to me?
-No.</b>

660
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:52,780
<b>Okay, fine. I'll be extra sneaky</b>

661
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,910
<b>and ask him what he thinks of you.</b>

662
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:57,660
<b>I'm doing this
because I think highly of your courage.</b>

663
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,420
<b>This is {i}yukjeon.{\i} It's from Gwangju.</b>

664
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:08,710
<b>Oh, my. Are you serious? {i}Yukjeon?{\i}</b>

665
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:16,140
<b>Why do you like Jeong-won so much?</b>

666
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:18,720
<b>Everything.</b>

667
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:20,640
<b>Do you need water?</b>

668
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,730
<b>I'm fine.</b>

669
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:25,230
<b>Gyeo-ul.</b>

670
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:28,980
<b>I think you have this fantasy
about Jeong-won.</b>

671
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,780
<b>The way he treats people at the hospital</b>

672
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:35,070
<b>and the way he behaves around us
are very different.</b>

673
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:37,870
<b>What is he like?
I want to hear everything.</b>

674
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:40,080
<b>He's so sensitive.</b>

675
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:43,450
<b>He loses sleep for a month
if something goes wrong with his patient.</b>

676
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:45,460
<b>He's so humanitarian.</b>

677
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:48,080
<b>And he's extremely stubborn.</b>

678
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:49,250
<b>He is a man of principles.</b>

679
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:51,670
<b>And he's not rich. He's dirt poor.</b>

680
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:53,340
<b>He mooches off Jun-wan.</b>

681
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,340
<b>Isn't that {i}noblesse oblige?{\i}</b>

682
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,550
<b>Are we playing a game of antonyms?</b>

683
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:01,640
<b>What else? Tell me everything.</b>

684
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,230
<b>Most importantly, he...</b>

685
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:07,650
<b>Gosh.</b>

686
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:09,940
<b>Dating...</b>

687
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:12,070
<b>No. He's not interested in women.</b>

688
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:15,570
<b>I have never seen him with a girl, ever.</b>

689
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,530
<b>This is for your ears only.</b>

690
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:23,450
<b>Jeong-won is interested in something else.</b>

691
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:25,450
<b>Is he a sexual minority?</b>

692
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:29,040
<b>Jeez. Not like that. I mean
he wants to be a man of God.</b>

693
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,830
<b>Not pride. A priest.</b>

694
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,880
<b>I doubt that.</b>

695
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,210
<b>I hope so, too.</b>

696
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:40,260
<b>I know that Professor Ahn
is a devout Catholic.</b>

697
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:43,060
<b>All his brothers are priests,
and his sisters are nuns.</b>

698
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:46,350
<b>But he's not a priest yet.</b>

699
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:48,310
<b>He just wants to be one.</b>

700
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:52,020
<b>Then I still have a chance.</b>

701

<b>Ik-jun, give me a cigarette.</b>

702

<b>Not with Gyeo-ul of all people.</b>

<b>You prick, you'd better come

705

<b>What?</b>

706
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,510
<b>What do you think of Gyeo-ul?</b>

707

<b>-What?

<b>Why are you sorry? I am sorry, Dad.</b>

<b>We're going to move

<b>How are you feeling?</b>

<b>Let me explain about the surgery.</b>

732
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:31,010
<b>As I told you,
I'll remove the infected mass</b>

<b>and mold the area
with the leftover tissue.</b>

734
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:35,520
<b>It will take about five hours.</b>

<b>But it could be longer

<b>Yes.</b>

00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:46,200
<b>Then, we don't have
to worry too much, right?</b>

739
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:49,320
<b>This surgery isn't life-threatening
or anything, right?</b>

740
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:50,780
<b>I cannot guarantee that.</b>

741
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:53,330
<b>There are a lot of variables
during surgery.</b>

742
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,330
<b>Oh, no.</b>

743
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:56,830
<b>However, I will do my best.</b>

744
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:05,760
<b>Jeez.</b>

745
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:10,510
<b>You should have just told them
that he's going to be fine.</b>

746
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:13,890
<b>The patient's daughter
is getting married today.</b>

747
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:16,520
<b>The whole family
must already feel bad for each other.</b>

748
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:19,100
<b>You should have been nicer to them.</b>

749
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:21,860
<b>You could have just told them</b>

750
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,360
<b>that the surgery will be successful,
so they have nothing to worry about.</b>

751
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,450
<b>Couldn't you just say that?</b>

752
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:31,280
<b>This surgery isn't that difficult for you.</b>

753
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,660
<b>What if the patient has
periannular abscess?</b>

754
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:39,420
<b>What if he has brain damage
from an embolism during surgery?</b>

755
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:42,040
<b>But the chance of that happening
is very low.</b>

756
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:44,590
<b>He has no feelings.</b>

757
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:46,800
<b>How do feelings help with surgery?</b>

758
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,880
<b>I'll be emotional if it helps,
but it doesn't.</b>

759
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:50,430
<b>It doesn't help at all.</b>

760
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:52,470
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

761
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:54,310
<b>Never talk to the patients
like that again.</b>

762
00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:56,310
<b>"It's a simple surgery. You will live.</b>

763
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:59,060
<b>This surgery will go well.
Don't worry about anything."</b>

764
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:02,690
<b>Don't. Got it?</b>

765
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:05,070
<b>Yes.</b>

766
00:43:16,450 --> 00:43:19,250
<b>YULJE MEDICAL CENTER</b>

767
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:25,460
<b>One iced Americano
with three shots, please.</b>

768
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:27,210
<b>-Hello, Professor Kim.
-Hello.</b>

769
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:30,340
<b>You guys are here early.
A piece of chocolate cake, too.</b>

770
00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:33,600
<b>We've been here
since eight in the morning.</b>

771
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:36,600
<b>Is that so? That's impressive.</b>

772
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:38,230
<b>-Pay with this.
-What?</b>

773
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,190
<b>-Thank you.
-Thank you.</b>

774
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:44,520
<b>Dr. Do is good to you, right?</b>

775
00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:46,320
<b>Yes, he's really nice.</b>

776
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,440
<b>Goodness. I'm glad to hear that.</b>

777
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:51,320
<b>Can I ask you
why you chose Cardiothoracic Surgery?</b>

778
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:55,910
<b>It's our assignment to do an interview.
We've asked another professor as well.</b>

779
00:43:55,990 --> 00:43:56,830
<b>Who?</b>

780
00:43:56,910 --> 00:44:00,330
<b>We've just started,
so we've only interviewed one professor.</b>

781
00:44:00,410 --> 00:44:02,540
<b>It's Professor Chae Song-hwa
of Neurosurgery.</b>

782
00:44:03,210 --> 00:44:04,330
<b>What did she say?</b>

783
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:07,550
<b>She chose Neurosurgery
because she wanted to study.</b>

784
00:44:07,630 --> 00:44:09,510
<b>There is still a lot to study
in her field.</b>

785
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:11,930
<b>I know. No one knows it better than I do.</b>

786
00:44:12,010 --> 00:44:13,340
<b>What about you, sir?</b>

787
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:17,760
<b>Me? I went to an Internet cafe</b>

788
00:44:17,850 --> 00:44:20,350
<b>and a cardiothoracic surgeon I sat next to
told me to choose CS.</b>

789
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:25,360
<b>-Professor, please.
-I'm serious.</b>

790
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,570
<b>I was asked whether
I wanted to make money or teach.</b>

791
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:29,570
<b>I said I'd prefer to teach</b>

792
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:30,780
<b>and he told me to choose CS.</b>

793
00:44:31,490 --> 00:44:32,490
<b>That's why I'm here.</b>

794
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:34,360
<b>I see.</b>

795
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:38,080
<b>May I have this chocolate cake?</b>

796
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,160
<b>No, you may not.</b>

797
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,330
<b>-Just get one more.
-Okay.</b>

798
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,930
<b>Irrigation is very important.
You know that, right?</b>

799
00:44:56,010 --> 00:44:58,390
<b>-Yes.
-Why is it important?</b>

800
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:03,640
<b>Well...</b>

801
00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:06,060
<b>Through the microscope,</b>

802
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:08,980
<b>you can see
that it's close to the optic nerve.</b>

803
00:45:10,030 --> 00:45:13,700
<b>So, a bipolar cautery
can cause thermal injuries,</b>

804
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:16,820
<b>which can result in loss of vision
after the surgery.</b>

805
00:45:26,210 --> 00:45:29,710
<b>Ms. Nam, we should operate
on Chan-hyeong tomorrow.</b>

806
00:45:30,210 --> 00:45:33,760
<b>Yes. His lung sounds have improved,
and the X-rays look much better.</b>

807
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:36,050
<b>Yes. It will be hard for him
if we keep putting it off.</b>

808
00:45:36,130 --> 00:45:37,760
<b>His guardians are here, right?</b>

809
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:39,390
<b>Yes, I'll go bring them in.</b>

810
00:45:43,310 --> 00:45:45,440
<b>Jae-hak, do you happen
to have a suit here?</b>

811
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,520
<b>Yes, I always keep one at the office.</b>

812
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:48,980
<b>Can I borrow it?</b>

813
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:51,980
<b>-They went home.
-What?</b>

814
00:45:52,570 --> 00:45:55,400
<b>They went home,
when their child is that sick?</b>

815
00:45:55,650 --> 00:45:56,910
<b>How can that be possible?</b>

816
00:45:56,990 --> 00:45:59,530
<b>Chan-hyeong's mom went home for a bit.</b>

817
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:02,330
<b>Both of his grandmothers are here though.</b>

818
00:46:02,410 --> 00:46:04,040
<b>They should be in the lounge.</b>

819
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:07,000
<b>Shall I go bring them in?</b>

820
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:08,290
<b>Yes, please.</b>

821
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:11,500
<b>We've been postponing the surgery
due to pneumonia,</b>

822
00:46:11,590 --> 00:46:13,960
<b>but the fever has gone down,
and so has the CRP.</b>

823
00:46:14,050 --> 00:46:15,470
<b>I think now would be the best time.</b>

824
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:19,220
<b>Is the operation dangerous, doctor?</b>

825
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:21,430
<b>-Are you his grandmother?
-I'm his maternal grandmother.</b>

826
00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:23,100
<b>-This is his paternal grandmother.
-I see.</b>

827
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:26,310
<b>For now, please be informed that
we will operate tomorrow afternoon.</b>

828
00:46:26,390 --> 00:46:29,650
<b>When his parents are back,
I'll walk them through the details.</b>

829
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:32,900
<b>You can just tell us instead.</b>

830
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:34,610
<b>His mom is only 20.</b>

831
00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:36,450
<b>She's clueless because she's so young.</b>

832
00:46:36,530 --> 00:46:38,240
<b>The same goes for my son.</b>

833
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:40,490
<b>That's right.
You can just tell us, doctor.</b>

834
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:42,200
<b>Then I'll speak to all of you later.</b>

835
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:44,120
<b>His mom is still his legal guardian.</b>

836
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:45,160
<b>I'll see you then.</b>

837
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:52,920
<b>You can talk
to the grandmothers, professor.</b>

838
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,630
<b>I'll go over everything with his mom
and get the consent form signed.</b>

839
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,300
<b>Don't overlook a single detail.</b>

840
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:00,050
<b>-Your suit is at the office?
-Yes.</b>

841
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:01,390
<b>-What color is it?
-Color?</b>

842
00:47:01,470 --> 00:47:03,600
<b>Yes, what color is your suit?</b>

843
00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:06,390
<b>Are you worried that it might be silver?</b>

844
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,260
<b>Jun-wan, are you...</b>

845
00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:40,260
<b>Oh, boy.</b>

846
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:42,140
<b>Don't say anything.</b>

847
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:43,220
<b>Okay.</b>

848
00:47:46,470 --> 00:47:48,640
<b>Are you not going to have lunch?
I'm hungry.</b>

849
00:47:48,770 --> 00:47:50,060
<b>How about braised hairtail fish?</b>

850
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:54,230
<b>I suddenly got a craving for it
for some reason.</b>

851
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:56,400
<b>I have to go out. I'm meeting someone.</b>

852
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:57,980
<b>What are you going to eat?</b>

853
00:47:58,190 --> 00:47:59,320
<b>Steak.</b>

854
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:01,240
<b>Gosh, I don't like steak.</b>

855
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:09,910
<b>Shall I eat out, too? It's been a while.</b>

856
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:15,130
<b>Hello. This is Ahn Jeong-won.</b>

857
00:48:16,090 --> 00:48:17,800
<b>Okay, I'll be right there.</b>

858
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:19,590
<b>Gosh.</b>

859
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:22,050
<b>Chi-hong, can you wrap this up for me?</b>

860
00:48:22,130 --> 00:48:23,090
<b>Sure.</b>

861
00:48:31,270 --> 00:48:33,270
<b>You have to insert the Hemovac first.</b>

862
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:34,560
<b>Yes.</b>

863
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:40,990
<b>Are you going to keep breaking it?</b>

864
00:48:41,570 --> 00:48:43,570
<b>Control your strength. Be gentle with it.</b>

865
00:48:45,070 --> 00:48:46,160
<b>Okay. I'm sorry.</b>

866
00:48:47,330 --> 00:48:48,790
<b>I'll stop talking.</b>

867
00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:50,410
<b>You should focus. I'm sorry.</b>

868
00:48:50,790 --> 00:48:51,790
<b>It's okay.</b>

869
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:54,790
<b>Mr. Yuk Hui-gwan.</b>

870
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,170
<b>-Congratulations. You can go home now.
-Thank you.</b>

871
00:48:57,250 --> 00:48:59,300
<b>Your surgical wound has been disinfected</b>

872
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:00,880
<b>and wrapped in waterproof bandage.</b>

873
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,630
<b>You can take a shower right away.</b>

874
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:06,470
<b>As for food, you can eat normally
but please try not to overeat.</b>

875
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:08,510
<b>Mom, can you transform this?</b>

876
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,720
<b>In a bit, Won-jun. Give me a minute.</b>

877
00:49:11,310 --> 00:49:13,520
<b>You have an appointment booked
in a week from now.</b>

878
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:15,230
<b>The biopsy results will be available then.</b>

879
00:49:15,310 --> 00:49:17,860
<b>If you need the diagnosis
for your insurance, just let us know.</b>

880
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:19,650
<b>-Okay, thank you.
-Thank you.</b>

881
00:49:19,730 --> 00:49:23,070
<b>Hurry, Mom. I want this
transformed into the robot.</b>

882
00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:27,120
<b>Is Dr. Lee Ik-jun doing rounds today
by any chance?</b>

883
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,370
<b>I haven't had a chance
to thank him properly.</b>

884
00:49:29,450 --> 00:49:30,660
<b>He did such an excellent job.</b>

885
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:32,000
<b>Won-jun!</b>

886
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:35,330
<b>-Hello, Dr. Lee.
-Yes, hello.</b>

887
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:37,210
<b>Give me that. I'll do it for you.</b>

888
00:49:37,330 --> 00:49:38,840
<b>My gosh.</b>

889
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:42,550
<b>Mr. Yuk, you don't even
look like a patient without your IV drip.</b>

890
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:43,670
<b>You're handsome.</b>

891
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:44,800
<b>Gosh, I'm flattered.</b>

892
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,840
<b>You remembered his name.</b>

893
00:49:46,930 --> 00:49:48,430
<b>You must have a lot of patients.</b>

894
00:49:48,510 --> 00:49:50,600
<b>My wife's surname is also Yuk.</b>

895
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:53,020
<b>Other than her, you're the only one
I know with that surname.</b>

896
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:56,980
<b>Actually, there's my father-in-law,
brother-in-law, sister-in-law, and niece.</b>

897
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:58,810
<b>Gosh, there are so many.</b>

898
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:00,690
<b>You're going home today, right?</b>

899
00:50:00,770 --> 00:50:04,280
<b>Yes. Tomorrow is Children's Day,
so I'm happy I can be home for that.</b>

900
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:05,820
<b>Yes, you're right.</b>

901
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:07,320
<b>I can't go anywhere far.</b>

902
00:50:07,410 --> 00:50:10,160
<b>We're just going to eat
at a Chinese restaurant near our place.</b>

903
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:11,740
<b>Won-jun loves {i}jajangmyeon.{\i}</b>

904
00:50:11,830 --> 00:50:14,580
<b>My kid loves {i}jajangmyeon{\i} too. All kids do.</b>

905
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:17,170
<b>You had a simple
laparoscopic cholecystectomy,</b>

906
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:19,380
<b>so don't worry about
post-surgical complications.</b>

907
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:21,090
<b>Don't overexert yourself</b>

908
00:50:21,170 --> 00:50:23,130
<b>but try to walk as much as you can.</b>

909
00:50:23,210 --> 00:50:25,010
<b>Exercise will help you, okay?</b>

910
00:50:25,510 --> 00:50:27,760
<b>All right. Here you go.</b>

911
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:30,220
<b>Wow, who are you?</b>

912
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:31,390
<b>Won-jun.</b>

913
00:50:31,470 --> 00:50:33,470
<b>You silly goose, what do you think?</b>

914
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:36,020
<b>I'm the one who got rid of the ouchy
from your dad's tummy.</b>

915
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,690
<b>Goodbye.
I'll see you at your next appointment.</b>

916
00:50:38,770 --> 00:50:40,560
<b>-Thank you.
-Thank you.</b>

917
00:50:40,650 --> 00:50:41,900
<b>Say goodbye properly.</b>

918
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,280
<b>-Thank you, Dr. Lee!
-My pleasure!</b>

919
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:46,780
<b>Oh, my. Look at this.</b>

920
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:48,240
<b>-Hello.
-Hello.</b>

921
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:52,660
<b>Hello.</b>

922
00:50:54,370 --> 00:50:55,660
<b>Did Song-hwa scold you again?</b>

923
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:57,410
<b>-Yes.
-No.</b>

924
00:50:57,910 --> 00:50:59,170
<b>I guess it was you then.</b>

925
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:01,460
<b>It was Chi-hong this time.</b>

926
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:02,670
<b>But he said no.</b>

927
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:05,630
<b>He's a tough cookie
because he has a military background.</b>

928
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:09,470
<b>It happened because
I couldn't answer her questions.</b>

929
00:51:09,590 --> 00:51:11,090
<b>Even I thought I sounded dumb.</b>

930
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:13,810
<b>You graduated
from the Korea Military Academy, right?</b>

931
00:51:13,890 --> 00:51:16,470
<b>-Yes.
-I know someone from...</b>

932
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:17,810
<b>Hello?</b>

933
00:51:18,390 --> 00:51:19,940
<b>Yes, where are you?</b>

934
00:51:20,350 --> 00:51:22,610
<b>Okay, I'll head over there now. All right.</b>

935
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:26,990
<b>Yes, Professor.</b>

936
00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:28,650
<b>Right.</b>

937
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:30,660
<b>Yes, I got it.</b>

938
00:51:31,530 --> 00:51:33,410
<b>You know the emergency patient
from the traffic accident yesterday?</b>

939
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:34,780
<b>-Yes.
-We haven't operated</b>

940
00:51:34,870 --> 00:51:37,200
<b>because of unstable vitals
and severe bleeding.</b>

941
00:51:37,290 --> 00:51:38,500
<b>But it seems Professor Chae</b>

942
00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:40,670
<b>-will perform the surgery tonight.
-I see.</b>

943
00:51:40,750 --> 00:51:42,960
<b>-There will be a meeting later.
-Okay, great.</b>

944
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:45,710
<b>-"Great"? Really?
-Yes.</b>

945
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:47,510
<b>She totally put you on the spot earlier.</b>

946
00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:50,090
<b>She was just asking questions.</b>

947
00:51:50,550 --> 00:51:52,300
<b>I wanted to work on that case anyway.</b>

948
00:51:52,390 --> 00:51:55,810
<b>I was hoping to be assigned
in assisting Professor Chae for the case.</b>

949
00:51:55,930 --> 00:51:57,270
<b>This is perfect.</b>

950
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:59,560
<b>-Dr. Ahn.
-Yes.</b>

951
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:01,900
<b>Why don't you get a cranial CT scan?</b>

952
00:52:03,770 --> 00:52:05,520
<b>Sure, if there's an employee discount.</b>

953
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:26,500
<b>Sounds good. We'll do that.</b>

954
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:30,050
<b>You should take a nap</b>

955
00:52:30,130 --> 00:52:31,420
<b>and I'll see you guys tonight.</b>

956
00:52:31,510 --> 00:52:32,510
<b>Okay.</b>

957
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:38,770
<b>She was going to do that
with the surgery anyway.</b>

958
00:52:38,850 --> 00:52:40,140
<b>You know that's not what matters.</b>

959
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:42,270
<b>What matters to her
is whether we knew it or not.</b>

960
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:49,440
<b>There are roses.</b>

961
00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:51,650
<b>Is it already the season for roses?</b>

962
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:55,200
<b>Dr. Yong, you're very observant.</b>

963
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:56,740
<b>My family has a flower shop.</b>

964
00:52:56,830 --> 00:52:58,700
<b>Everyone knows what roses look like.</b>

965
00:52:58,790 --> 00:52:59,950
<b>Not really. These days,</b>

966
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:02,790
<b>many people don't know
the names of plants and flowers.</b>

967
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,670
<b>Are they fake flowers?</b>

968
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:21,060
<b>That's just wrong.</b>

969
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:28,190
<b>I'm just realizing that it's been
a long time since I saw real flowers.</b>

970
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:31,400
<b>Professor Chae,
are you going camping again this weekend?</b>

971
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:32,530
<b>Yes, why do you ask?</b>

972
00:53:32,610 --> 00:53:33,990
<b>Can we join?</b>

973
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:36,450
<b>You can come, right?
You're not working this weekend.</b>

974
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:38,490
<b>Can we join?</b>

975
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:41,580
<b>Yes, you can.
But do you guys really want to come?</b>

976
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:42,750
<b>Yes.</b>

977
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,460
<b>You keep us on our toes,</b>

978
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:47,460
<b>but you don't make us uncomfortable.</b>

979
00:53:47,710 --> 00:53:50,590
<b>Gosh, Seok-min. My goodness.</b>

980
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:52,630
<b>I just can't hate you.</b>

981
00:53:52,710 --> 00:53:54,130
<b>You annoy me here and there,</b>

982
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:55,720
<b>but you don't make me uncomfortable.</b>

983
00:53:57,430 --> 00:53:59,890
<b>Okay, let's do it.
There, you can see real roses</b>

984
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:01,600
<b>as well as butterflies.</b>

985
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:02,520
<b>I'm off.</b>

986
00:54:09,110 --> 00:54:10,110
<b>Did you order?</b>

987
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,820
<b>The coffee here is very good.</b>

988
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:13,320
<b>Do you want some cake?</b>

989
00:54:14,530 --> 00:54:16,320
<b>Can we go somewhere quiet?</b>

990
00:54:17,490 --> 00:54:20,030
<b>-What?
-I have to talk to you about something.</b>

991
00:54:24,290 --> 00:54:26,460
<b>YULJE MEDICAL CENTER</b>

992
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:31,590
<b>Ho-jun.</b>

993
00:54:32,130 --> 00:54:33,920
<b>Go get changed.</b>

994
00:54:34,010 --> 00:54:36,930
<b>I brought a T-shirt
and a pair of pants for you.</b>

995
00:54:37,010 --> 00:54:38,640
<b>The visiting hours will begin shortly.</b>

996
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:40,390
<b>I'll get changed after I see Dad.</b>

997
00:54:40,470 --> 00:54:43,850
<b>Gosh, you still have 20 to 30 minutes.</b>

998
00:54:44,930 --> 00:54:47,770
<b>Hey, I see some chairs over there.
Let's go sit down.</b>

999
00:54:47,850 --> 00:54:49,060
<b>Okay.</b>

1000
00:54:50,270 --> 00:54:51,690
<b>She must be out of her mind.</b>

1001
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:57,110
<b>I can't believe this.
Did she cancel her honeymoon?</b>

1002
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:59,410
<b>Eun-bin! We're here.</b>

1003
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:05,790
<b>Hey, don't be like that.</b>

1004
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,330
<b>Everything went well.</b>

1005
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:13,250
<b>Jin-hui is a good photographer.</b>

1006
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:15,000
<b>No, it's my camera.</b>

1007
00:55:15,090 --> 00:55:17,220
<b>Downloading all the photos
would be a nuisance,</b>

1008
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:19,090
<b>so I told her to use my phone
to take photos.</b>

1009
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:22,180
<b>Oh, your uncle was there too.</b>

1010
00:55:22,850 --> 00:55:25,390
<b>He said he wouldn't be able to make it.</b>

1011
00:55:25,470 --> 00:55:27,930
<b>Oh, who's this?</b>

1012
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:31,850
<b>Isn't he the doctor
who performed your dad's surgery?</b>

1013
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:33,820
<b>Eun-bin,
Dad's doctor came to your wedding?</b>

1014
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:35,020
<b>Yes.</b>

1015
00:55:35,110 --> 00:55:35,940
<b>When?</b>

1016
00:55:36,690 --> 00:55:39,530
<b>He was the first one
to stop by the bride's room.</b>

1017
00:55:39,610 --> 00:55:41,780
<b>What's with that face though?</b>

1018
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:44,490
<b>He didn't even take a picture.
He just ate and left.</b>

1019
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:45,910
<b>Come on. Be grateful that he came.</b>

1020
00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:48,330
<b>He asked me about the main course.
I told him it's {i}galbitang.{\i}</b>

1021
00:55:48,410 --> 00:55:51,370
<b>Then he got excited
and rushed to the diner.</b>

1022
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:53,380
<b>He obviously came to my wedding
to have dinner.</b>

1023
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:55,630
<b>Come on. {i}Galbitang{\i} is nothing.</b>

1024
00:55:55,710 --> 00:55:58,760
<b>I'd love to take him out
for a steak dinner.</b>

1025
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:01,380
<b>He'd say no to that anyway.</b>

1026
00:56:01,470 --> 00:56:03,090
<b>Doctors can't say yes to things like that.</b>

1027
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:05,220
<b>I didn't think he'd be like this,</b>

1028
00:56:05,390 --> 00:56:06,890
<b>but he's actually very charming.</b>

1029
00:56:06,970 --> 00:56:09,770
<b>The ICU is open now. Come on in.</b>

1030
00:56:09,850 --> 00:56:11,890
<b>Oh, okay. Thank you.</b>

1031
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:13,230
<b>Thank you.</b>

1032
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:18,230
<b>Hey, don't cry.</b>

1033
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:20,530
<b>Are you going to cry in front of Dad?</b>

1034
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,700
<b>Seriously, don't cry.</b>

1035
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:26,950
<b>Why are you crying? His surgery went well.</b>

1036
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:29,120
<b>Dad will be so sad to see you cry.</b>

1037
00:56:31,790 --> 00:56:32,710
<b>Stop crying.</b>

1038
00:56:33,170 --> 00:56:35,590
<b>You will break Dad's heart.
You know that, right?</b>

1039
00:56:35,670 --> 00:56:36,880
<b>Right.</b>

1040
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:41,090
<b>Smile.</b>

1041
00:56:45,470 --> 00:56:46,550
<b>Give me a bigger smile.</b>

1042
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:53,560
<b>Aren't you leaving?</b>

1043
00:56:54,060 --> 00:56:56,900
<b>Hey. I have surgery tomorrow
as well as patient appointments,</b>

1044
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:59,110
<b>-so I have a lot to do.
-Then reschedule the surgery.</b>

1045
00:56:59,190 --> 00:57:01,070
<b>I can't do that.</b>

1046
00:57:01,150 --> 00:57:02,610
<b>How many appointments?</b>

1047
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:03,700
<b>Twenty.</b>

1048
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:05,320
<b>I have to go through their charts.</b>

1049
00:57:05,990 --> 00:57:07,240
<b>Why are you still here?</b>

1050
00:57:07,530 --> 00:57:09,120
<b>Everyone did a good job with the surgery,</b>

1051
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:10,620
<b>so I want to stop by the office.</b>

1052
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:13,460
<b>-Go check in on Ik-jun.
-Why?</b>

1053
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:15,920
<b>I think something's up,
but he won't tell me.</b>

1054
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,040
<b>-Really?
-I think it's a family matter,</b>

1055
00:57:18,130 --> 00:57:20,000
<b>so I didn't want to pry.</b>

1056
00:57:20,590 --> 00:57:22,470
<b>But that doesn't sound like him.</b>

1057
00:57:22,550 --> 00:57:25,050
<b>Well, I'm sure he'll sort it out.</b>

1058
00:57:25,130 --> 00:57:26,050
<b>Bye.</b>

1059
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:36,270
<b>{i}What did you just say?{\i}</b>

1060
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:38,610
<b>I said I want a divorce.</b>

1061
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:43,240
<b>I wouldn't call this a normal marriage.</b>

1062
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:45,400
<b>Let's just go back to being friends.</b>

1063
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:49,780
<b>We're like this because this was
what you wanted.</b>

1064
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,000
<b>When you got transferred,</b>

1065
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:56,080
<b>I told you I'd follow you to Germany</b>

1066
00:57:56,170 --> 00:57:57,000
<b>and you refused.</b>

1067
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:58,580
<b>You wanted me to keep working.</b>

1068
00:57:58,670 --> 00:58:00,800
<b>Also, you wanted to raise U-ju in Korea.</b>

1069
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:03,380
<b>That's why we're living like this.
So were we...</b>

1070
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:07,430
<b>Were we separated?</b>

1071
00:58:07,510 --> 00:58:08,930
<b>No, we weren't.</b>

1072
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:12,010
<b>I like that you have a career.</b>

1073
00:58:13,390 --> 00:58:16,140
<b>And I can totally look after U-ju
by myself.</b>

1074
00:58:16,730 --> 00:58:20,610
<b>I know that we've been living apart
for quite a while,</b>

1075
00:58:20,690 --> 00:58:22,690
<b>but we made that decision together.</b>

1076
00:58:22,780 --> 00:58:23,990
<b>Why are you saying...</b>

1077
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:26,360
<b>What's going on?</b>

1078
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:29,870
<b>What's the real reason?</b>

1079
00:58:29,950 --> 00:58:32,030
<b>There's no such thing.</b>

1080
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:37,210
<b>I just felt that it was meaningless</b>

1081
00:58:37,330 --> 00:58:39,420
<b>to maintain this kind of marriage.</b>

1082
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:43,960
<b>Do you mistrust me?</b>

1083
00:58:44,590 --> 00:58:45,420
<b>No.</b>

1084
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:49,220
<b>I'm going to have lunch
with U-ju tomorrow,</b>

1085
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:50,680
<b>just the two of us.</b>

1086
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:52,220
<b>It's a special day, you know.</b>

1087
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:54,390
<b>You should work.</b>

1088
00:58:54,470 --> 00:58:56,310
<b>I'll stay with him tomorrow.</b>

1089
00:58:57,890 --> 00:59:01,060
<b>And about what I said...</b>

1090
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:05,360
<b>I hope you take it seriously.</b>

1091
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:30,840
<b>Dr. Ahn, do you want to go for coffee?</b>

1092
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:32,720
<b>Sure.</b>

1093
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:37,810
<b>How many questions did I ask you today?</b>

1094
00:59:41,310 --> 00:59:42,360
<b>I'm not sure.</b>

1095
00:59:43,150 --> 00:59:45,230
<b>There were many. So many.</b>

1096
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:46,820
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

1097
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:48,440
<b>No, it's okay.</b>

1098
00:59:48,530 --> 00:59:52,450
<b>Chi-hong, do you know how many operations
I perform on a weekly basis?</b>

1099
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:55,830
<b>Jeez, I'm asking you a question again.</b>

1100
00:59:56,540 --> 00:59:58,330
<b>I have a problem, don't I?</b>

1101
00:59:58,540 --> 01:00:00,080
<b>I'm really sorry.</b>

1102
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:02,710
<b>I think you do more than five a week,
on average.</b>

1103
01:00:03,290 --> 01:00:04,750
<b>That means, in a year...</b>

1104
01:00:05,420 --> 01:00:08,420
<b>I probably do about 250, roughly speaking.</b>

1105
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:09,880
<b>Right.</b>

1106
01:00:10,590 --> 01:00:12,090
<b>I want you to be on your toes.</b>

1107
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:17,310
<b>When you're performing surgery
or treating patients.</b>

1108

<b>Both you and Seok-min</b>

1109

<b>should stay alert and focused

1110
01:00:25,270 --> 01:00:26,320
<b>Yes.</b>

1111
01:00:27,530 --> 01:00:29,360
<b>You see, this job is hard.</b>

1112
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:30,700
<b>But you get used to it quickly.</b>

1113
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:36,740
<b>The thing is though, we should never get
too comfortable doing this.</b>

1114
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:38,200
<b>That's why.</b>

1115
01:00:40,330 --> 01:00:41,160
<b>Right.</b>

1116
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:44,920
<b>It's not because I don't like you,
so don't get me wrong.</b>

1117
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:47,800
<b>And you'd better not give up
halfway through.</b>

1118
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:49,460
<b>Okay.</b>

1119
01:00:49,550 --> 01:00:51,590
<b>Just trust me and follow my lead.</b>

1120

-Yes, ma'am.</b>

-Professor, Chan-hyeong is doing great.</b>

1122

<b>I checked everything just now.</b>

1123

<b>Really? There's no need for me to check?

1124
01:01:14,030 --> 01:01:16,070
<b>Yes. Everything looks good,</b>

1125
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:18,620
<b>so just go home already.</b>

1126
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:19,620
<b>All right.</b>

1127
01:01:28,090 --> 01:01:30,800
<b>Dr. Do walked you through
the surgery procedure, right?</b>

1128
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:33,420
<b>Chan-hyeong's condition has improved,
so we'll perform surgery...</b>

1129
01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:36,260
<b>Oh, my.</b>

1130
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:41,270
<b>Doctor, please take good care
of Chan-hyeong.</b>

1131
01:01:42,390 --> 01:01:45,480
<b>My gosh, you've been staying
so strong until now.</b>

1132
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:48,310
<b>Please save Chan-hyeong.</b>

1133
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:53,360
<b>I wish it was me instead of him.</b>

1134
01:01:59,030 --> 01:02:00,790
<b>Don't cry.</b>

1135
01:02:01,740 --> 01:02:04,000
<b>You've been holding out so well.</b>

1136
01:02:05,410 --> 01:02:07,580
<b>I've been barely keeping it together.</b>

1137
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:15,800
<b>Both my mom and my mother-in-law
think that we're still kids.</b>

1138
01:02:17,050 --> 01:02:19,720
<b>Everyone says that we're immature.</b>

1139
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:23,470
<b>So I've been acting all tough on purpose.</b>

1140
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:26,230
<b>I wanted to cry, but I was afraid</b>

1141
01:02:26,690 --> 01:02:29,730
<b>that they'd say we're too young
to deal with this.</b>

1142
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:32,020
<b>They would tell me to go home

1143
01:02:32,110 --> 01:02:34,860
<b>What if they wouldn't even let me
see Chan-hyeong?</b>

1144
01:02:34,940 --> 01:02:38,200
<b>That's why I've been forcing myself
to act all tough.</b>

1145
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:42,870
<b>But I can't do it anymore.</b>

1146
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:48,500
<b>Doctor, Chan-hyeong will be okay, right?</b>

1147
01:02:49,250 --> 01:02:50,880
<b>We've performed this surgery many times.</b>

1148
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:52,630
<b>We'll make sure he'll be okay.</b>

1149
01:02:53,250 --> 01:02:56,260
<b>Then, it will go well, right?</b>

1150
01:03:00,590 --> 01:03:03,260
<b>Yes, we'll do our best.</b>

<b>By the way, why did you go home

<b>I'm sorry. I heard that

01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:09,580
<b>They were going through the records</b>

1189
01:06:09,660 --> 01:06:13,620
<b>and found out that he is
the brain-dead organ donor.</b>

1190
01:06:14,330 --> 01:06:15,750
<b>He came in as a TA victim.</b>

1191
01:06:15,830 --> 01:06:18,630
<b>His GCS score was five, which indicated
a high probability of brain death.</b>

1192
01:06:19,210 --> 01:06:20,840
<b>His family has consented
to organ donation,</b>

1193
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:22,960
<b>so they've already done an EEG.</b>

1194
01:06:23,050 --> 01:06:25,420
<b>The committee will meet soon
to confirm the diagnosis.</b>

1195
01:06:25,510 --> 01:06:28,890
<b>Initially, I was just notified
that it was a traffic accident victim.</b>

1196
01:06:30,390 --> 01:06:32,600
<b>They wanted us to let you know
as soon as possible</b>

1197
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:34,640
<b>because he's your patient.</b>

1198
01:06:35,770 --> 01:06:37,900
<b>The organ is going to another patient
at our hospital,</b>

1199
01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:40,150
<b>so we'll have to take care
of the procurement as well.</b>

1200
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:45,150
<b>Gosh, I feel bad.</b>

1201
01:06:49,820 --> 01:06:52,240
<b>His tricuspid valve is very small,
so it's hard to see.</b>

1202
01:06:52,990 --> 01:06:55,540
<b>No, not that way.
Pull it toward the patient's head.</b>

1203
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:57,330
<b>Yes.</b>

1204
01:06:58,790 --> 01:07:01,420
<b>Pull harder,
or we'll have to make a bigger incision.</b>

1205
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:03,000
<b>Okay, I'm sorry.</b>

1206
01:07:05,670 --> 01:07:07,470
<b>You see that monitor, right?</b>

1207
01:07:07,550 --> 01:07:10,470
<b>The line is flat now,
which means the heart rate is zero.</b>

1208
01:07:10,550 --> 01:07:11,470
<b>That means he's dead.</b>

1209
01:07:12,140 --> 01:07:13,220
<b>No.</b>

1210
01:07:13,310 --> 01:07:16,480
<b>It just means that Chan-hyeong's
current heart rate is zero.</b>

1211
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:19,520
<b>His heart isn't beating at the moment.</b>

1212
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:21,980
<b>They can't operate on him
while the heart is beating.</b>

1213
01:07:22,060 --> 01:07:24,400
<b>That's why the cardioplegia solution
is administered</b>

1214
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:26,690
<b>every 30 minutes to induce cardiac stasis
when performing</b>

1215
01:07:26,780 --> 01:07:28,030
<b>any cardiac surgery procedures.</b>

1216
01:07:28,110 --> 01:07:30,450
<b>And during cardiac stasis,
that machine over there</b>

1217
01:07:30,530 --> 01:07:32,990
<b>acts as the patient's heart and lungs.</b>

1218
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:35,120
<b>It supplies blood throughout the body</b>

1219
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:37,620
<b>while doctors are operating on the heart.</b>

1220
01:07:37,710 --> 01:07:39,290
<b>All right. Let's go over it again.</b>

1221
01:07:39,870 --> 01:07:43,170
<b>Stop Chan-hyeong's heart,
which is replaced by the machine.</b>

1222
01:07:43,250 --> 01:07:46,050
<b>While the machine's working,
the doctors quickly fix the heart.</b>

1223
01:07:46,130 --> 01:07:47,170
<b>When everything's fixed,</b>

1224
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:50,090
<b>they get rid of the tubes
that hook him up to the machine.</b>

1225
01:07:50,180 --> 01:07:52,680
<b>You're telling me all this
so that you can remember the steps.</b>

1226
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:54,510
<b>You're doing it to memorize the steps.</b>

1227
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:55,560
<b>That's right.</b>

1228
01:07:56,060 --> 01:07:58,310
<b>-You understand the procedure, right?
-Yes, totally.</b>

1231
01:08:13,490 --> 01:08:16,080
<b>Oh, they've finished

1232

<b>The committee will meet soon

1233

<b>He's a TA victim, but I heard
the organs are in good condition.</b>

1234
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:24,670
<b>They're probably negotiating
the time frame with the other hospital.</b>

1235
01:08:26,250 --> 01:08:27,420
<b>Why? Do you know that patient?</b>

1236
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:28,880
<b>He was my patient.</b>

1237

<b>He was totally fine

1238

<b>Really? My goodness.</b>

1239
01:08:34,510 --> 01:08:36,970
<b>It must've been a very difficult decision.</b>

1240
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:39,980
<b>You should say a proper goodbye.</b>

1241
