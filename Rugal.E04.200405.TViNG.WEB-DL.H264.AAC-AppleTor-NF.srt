4
00:01:05,211 --> 00:01:06,212
<b>Gi-beom.</b>

5
00:01:09,715 --> 00:01:12,259
<b>-Where's Hwang Deuk-gu?
-He got away.</b>

6
00:01:12,343 --> 00:01:13,219
<b>What?</b>

7
00:01:14,261 --> 00:01:15,388
<b>The police car.</b>

8
00:01:15,471 --> 00:01:17,306
<b>-The police car?
-Yes.</b>

9
00:01:18,099 --> 00:01:19,809
<b>The police aren't on our side, either.</b>

10
00:01:20,518 --> 00:01:22,353
<b>Some of them are helping Argos.</b>

11
00:01:27,525 --> 00:01:29,402
<b>-Gi-beom.
-Kang Gi-beom.</b>

12
00:01:44,417 --> 00:01:46,419
<b><i>Gi-beom, it's him.</i></b>

13
00:02:21,078 --> 00:02:22,204
<b>Are you a defect as well?</b>

14
00:03:05,372 --> 00:03:07,750
<b>Did you find the police car
that took Hwang Deuk-gu?</b>

15
00:03:10,044 --> 00:03:10,878
<b>Not yet.</b>

16
00:03:10,961 --> 00:03:13,214
<b>We should've followed
Gi-beom's decision, then.</b>

17
00:03:13,714 --> 00:03:15,925
<b>You should have killed him back then.</b>

18
00:03:17,259 --> 00:03:18,344
<b>Mi-na.</b>

19
00:03:18,928 --> 00:03:20,679
<b>Don't let your emotions get in the way.</b>

20
00:03:20,763 --> 00:03:23,099
<b>I didn't let it.
I'm being loyal to our cause.</b>

21
00:03:23,557 --> 00:03:25,810
<b>You brought us here because we are loyal.</b>

22
00:03:25,893 --> 00:03:26,936
<b>Don't lose focus.</b>

23
00:03:27,645 --> 00:03:30,606
<b>We must bring down Argos.
Not just Hwang Deuk-gu.</b>

24
00:03:30,689 --> 00:03:32,525
<b>Why did you shut down Gi-beom eyes?</b>

25
00:03:34,068 --> 00:03:37,071
<b>Once he's out of control,
he's just a subject we must subdue.</b>

26
00:03:37,154 --> 00:03:39,073
<b>You're not dealing with a robot here.</b>

27
00:03:39,615 --> 00:03:42,034
<b>The situations we were inserted in
were always uncontrollable.</b>

28
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,121
<b>Does it mean we must crumble
and let those bastards get away?</b>

29
00:03:45,663 --> 00:03:47,498
<b>-I'm sure you already knew it.
-I'm angry.</b>

30
00:03:47,581 --> 00:03:49,542
<b>Because we lost Hwang?
Or because you pity Gi-beom?</b>

31
00:03:51,043 --> 00:03:53,254
<b>If it's neither,
is this insubordination against me?</b>

32
00:03:53,337 --> 00:03:55,131
<b>Because of those bastards,</b>

33
00:03:55,214 --> 00:03:56,674
<b>the pain we</b>

34
00:03:59,343 --> 00:04:02,555
<b>must face infuriates me.</b>

35
00:04:41,135 --> 00:04:43,137
<b>-What is it?
-We failed to track him down.</b>

36
00:04:43,846 --> 00:04:47,057
<b>The police said that no police officers
went on a patrol to that area.</b>

37
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,646
<b>Do you want to blame me, too?</b>

38
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:58,068
<b>No. The responsibility of a failed
operation and an insubordinate member</b>

39
00:04:58,652 --> 00:05:01,071
<b>falls upon the team leader, myself.</b>

40
00:05:01,322 --> 00:05:02,573
<b>Is that all you want to say?</b>

41
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,909
<b>I only follow orders.</b>

42
00:05:05,618 --> 00:05:07,620
<b>Making decisions for the team
isn't my job.</b>

43
00:05:10,164 --> 00:05:11,248
<b>It's just that</b>

44
00:05:11,874 --> 00:05:15,794
<b>shutting down his artificial eyes
was a punishment enough for his actions.</b>

45
00:05:17,463 --> 00:05:20,007
<b>I'm sure Gi-beom
reflected on his actions, too.</b>

46
00:05:20,549 --> 00:05:22,051
<b>It's been long enough, too.</b>

47
00:05:23,093 --> 00:05:24,053
<b>Please let him out.</b>

48
00:06:21,318 --> 00:06:24,405
<b>We tried to get the best subjects,
but this is all they amount to.</b>

49
00:06:24,905 --> 00:06:28,117
<b>It's a waste to just throw them away.
Can't we recycle them?</b>

50
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,202
<b>If I stop their brain activities,</b>

51
00:06:30,786 --> 00:06:32,371
<b>I can delay necrosis.</b>

52
00:06:37,835 --> 00:06:40,796
<b>You risked your life
for a promise of a better future.</b>

53
00:06:41,547 --> 00:06:43,340
<b>I bet you don't want to die yet.</b>

54
00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:46,051
<b>You ought to</b>

55
00:06:47,344 --> 00:06:48,887
<b>go out with a bang.</b>

56
00:06:51,682 --> 00:06:54,685
<b>Your memory of the pain
will disappear soon.</b>

57
00:06:55,769 --> 00:06:56,979
<b>Don't worry.</b>

58
00:07:28,844 --> 00:07:32,348
<b>When will you take care
of those moles in the police?</b>

59
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:35,559
<b>We'll scare them away
if we're not careful.</b>

60
00:07:36,518 --> 00:07:38,187
<b>Wait until the time is right.</b>

61
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,064
<b>I'm being treated
like an incompetent chief.</b>

62
00:07:41,482 --> 00:07:42,941
<b>Do you even care about that?</b>

63
00:07:43,567 --> 00:07:45,944
<b>One cannot attain glory without suffering.</b>

64
00:07:46,653 --> 00:07:49,239
<b>In many circumstances,
if we don't kill, we will be killed.</b>

65
00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:51,617
<b>Grant my team</b>

66
00:07:52,826 --> 00:07:53,952
<b>a license to kill.</b>

67
00:07:57,623 --> 00:08:00,042
<b>You strongly argued
that you could keep your team, Rugal,</b>

68
00:08:00,501 --> 00:08:01,835
<b>under control in such situations.</b>

69
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,172
<b>I still stand by it. I just want
to raise the degree of our defense.</b>

70
00:08:06,131 --> 00:08:09,385
<b>As they are turning more vicious,
we need a sure way to shut them down.</b>

71
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,972
<b>Just make do what you can do.</b>

72
00:08:15,891 --> 00:08:17,184
<b>This may be a covert operation,</b>

73
00:08:17,267 --> 00:08:19,561
<b>but this is still a national project.</b>

74
00:08:19,853 --> 00:08:22,940
<b>I'd like to get official permission.
Guarantee us legal immunity.</b>

75
00:08:27,611 --> 00:08:28,654
<b>I will</b>

76
00:08:29,321 --> 00:08:30,906
<b>try again to persuade him.</b>

77
00:08:53,387 --> 00:08:54,555
<b><i>You're pretty good.</i></b>

78
00:08:55,431 --> 00:08:56,432
<b>What's this?</b>

79
00:08:56,515 --> 00:08:58,434
<b><i>Having a chat may be too much for you.</i></b>

80
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:05,524
<b>Are you talking to me?</b>

81
00:09:12,281 --> 00:09:13,407
<b><i>One hundred percent.</i></b>

82
00:09:15,242 --> 00:09:16,368
<b>What is happening?</b>

83
00:09:26,253 --> 00:09:28,839
<b>Gi-beom, you're free to come out--</b>

84
00:09:31,884 --> 00:09:32,759
<b>What's wrong with him?</b>

85
00:09:34,261 --> 00:09:37,014
<b>-Hey, are you all right?
-Yes.</b>

86
00:09:37,389 --> 00:09:39,475
<b>I'm fine, but I can't seem to move.</b>

87
00:09:43,812 --> 00:09:45,689
<b>There's nothing wrong with the program.</b>

88
00:09:45,772 --> 00:09:48,650
<b>I didn't detect any errors
with his artificial eyes, either.</b>

89
00:09:49,359 --> 00:09:51,987
<b>Was there anything unusual
or uncomfortable?</b>

90
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:53,113
<b>I don't know.</b>

91
00:09:53,614 --> 00:09:56,950
<b>I saw something for a split second,
and it disappeared again.</b>

92
00:09:57,743 --> 00:09:59,328
<b>That's odd.</b>

93
00:09:59,786 --> 00:10:02,164
<b>Things were weird
when the streaming was turned off.</b>

94
00:10:02,247 --> 00:10:03,916
<b>Is it just a simple malfunction?</b>

95
00:10:03,999 --> 00:10:06,210
<b>I'll reset it for now.</b>

96
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,058
<b>I can't live my life in anxiety.
Can you inspect this more thoroughly?</b>

97
00:10:21,725 --> 00:10:23,143
<b>Observing you makes us more anxious.</b>

98
00:10:24,311 --> 00:10:27,606
<b>Looking at your vitals,
your heart is beating slightly faster.</b>

99
00:10:27,689 --> 00:10:28,982
<b>Any other unusual changes?</b>

100
00:10:29,066 --> 00:10:30,984
<b>So far, it's still in the normal range.</b>

101
00:10:31,443 --> 00:10:33,820
<b>Let's run a physical checkup first.</b>

102
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,336
<b>Look.</b>

103
00:10:49,419 --> 00:10:52,130
<b>The maximum rate of oxygen consumption
went up by 170 percent.</b>

104
00:10:52,297 --> 00:10:53,173
<b>No way.</b>

105
00:10:53,257 --> 00:10:55,217
<b>A significant portion of that
is an innate quality.</b>

106
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,927
<b>It won't go up that easily.</b>

107
00:11:04,017 --> 00:11:05,936
<b>Is he back to his original condition?</b>

108
00:11:06,562 --> 00:11:07,813
<b>Yes, for now.</b>

109
00:11:08,981 --> 00:11:10,524
<b>Shutting his eyes down was a risky move.</b>

110
00:11:11,149 --> 00:11:13,610
<b>You should have been more careful
when executing that.</b>

111
00:11:14,653 --> 00:11:15,779
<b>Explain to me.</b>

112
00:11:16,572 --> 00:11:19,324
<b>How was he able
to stop streaming on his own?</b>

113
00:11:20,033 --> 00:11:22,202
<b>That kind of process doesn't exist.</b>

114
00:11:22,661 --> 00:11:23,912
<b>Is that so?</b>

115
00:11:24,663 --> 00:11:27,165
<b>Then, I need you to examine
the error more thoroughly.</b>

116
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:29,835
<b>We must find out
if it was a bug in the algorithm</b>

117
00:11:30,752 --> 00:11:34,089
<b>or if it was an improvement of
the artificial eyes that resembled a bug.</b>

118
00:11:36,758 --> 00:11:38,635
<b>Okay. I will look into it.</b>

119
00:11:47,811 --> 00:11:50,522
<b>Look at his muscles.
They are improving as he exercises.</b>

120
00:11:50,814 --> 00:11:51,940
<b>I don't believe this.</b>

121
00:12:01,908 --> 00:12:03,201
<b>You're perfectly competent.</b>

122
00:12:03,535 --> 00:12:06,997
<b>You have the guts to make bold decisions
and have incredible physical attributes.</b>

123
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,417
<b>You're like a double-edged sword.</b>

124
00:12:10,751 --> 00:12:12,628
<b>You're a threat
to the foundation of Rugal.</b>

125
00:12:13,503 --> 00:12:14,671
<b>This is your second strike.</b>

126
00:12:15,464 --> 00:12:16,632
<b>I apologize.</b>

127
00:12:17,257 --> 00:12:19,092
<b>But I don't think I was wrong.</b>

128
00:12:19,176 --> 00:12:20,427
<b>I did take an extreme measure,</b>

129
00:12:21,053 --> 00:12:23,513
<b>but I don't plan on giving you my excuses.</b>

130
00:12:27,934 --> 00:12:28,977
<b>To tell you the truth,</b>

131
00:12:29,728 --> 00:12:31,730
<b>it's very hard for me to conceal my anger.</b>

132
00:12:32,648 --> 00:12:36,026
<b>We have a lot of responsibilities,
but we don't have the rights.</b>

133
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,237
<b>All of the injustices originate
from this imbalance.</b>

134
00:12:41,031 --> 00:12:45,118
<b>If we show them our accomplishments,
we may be able to balance this.</b>

135
00:12:46,953 --> 00:12:49,081
<b>Then, I will earn privileges for Rugal.</b>

136
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:58,382
<b>Since you've recovered, you no longer
have to stay in the solitary cell.</b>

137
00:13:00,092 --> 00:13:01,134
<b>Sir.</b>

138
00:13:03,762 --> 00:13:05,222
<b>Don't trust me.</b>

139
00:13:05,722 --> 00:13:07,265
<b>Keep me under your control.</b>

140
00:13:12,688 --> 00:13:16,983
<b>Are you aware of
what that entails for you?</b>

141
00:13:20,153 --> 00:13:21,113
<b>But in exchange,</b>

142
00:13:21,947 --> 00:13:23,907
<b>grant me freedom
within the realm of your control.</b>

143
00:13:24,491 --> 00:13:25,492
<b>Freedom?</b>

144
00:13:25,575 --> 00:13:27,285
<b>Freedom to build teamwork.</b>

145
00:13:37,921 --> 00:13:39,715
<b>-What are you doing?
-Damn it. Come on!</b>

146
00:13:41,675 --> 00:13:43,176
<b>It's really nice to see you.</b>

147
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,971
<b>Are you playing with food?</b>

148
00:13:47,681 --> 00:13:49,599
<b>You said you like your food neat.</b>

149
00:13:49,683 --> 00:13:50,726
<b>Was that for me?</b>

150
00:13:52,602 --> 00:13:53,895
<b>I appreciate the thought.</b>

151
00:13:54,646 --> 00:13:57,065
<b>I've been eating all the meals
given to me. I'm stuffed.</b>

152
00:13:57,649 --> 00:13:58,984
<b>Mi-na and Tae-woong gave me food.</b>

153
00:14:08,326 --> 00:14:09,619
<b>Eat.</b>

154
00:14:17,419 --> 00:14:18,462
<b>You must eat to survive.</b>

155
00:14:22,924 --> 00:14:26,553
<b>They were tempting the agent

156
00:14:26,636 --> 00:14:27,721
<b>Darn it.</b>

157
00:14:27,804 --> 00:14:29,973
<b>Why would I do that? I'd starve.
It's bad for my health.</b>

158
00:14:30,056 --> 00:14:32,476
<b>-What?
-This is good, though.</b>

159
00:14:33,268 --> 00:14:34,978
<b>Are you feeling better? How are your eyes?</b>

160
00:14:35,562 --> 00:14:38,023
<b>-You're out.
-But still, I prepared this for you.</b>

161
00:14:38,106 --> 00:14:40,567
<b>One at a time. Can you take turns?</b>

162
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:43,028
<b>Besides,
I can't believe you got me snacks.</b>

163
00:14:43,111 --> 00:14:45,530
<b>Hey, I was the first one
to ask you a question.</b>

164
00:14:45,614 --> 00:14:47,157
<b>I'm fine. I'm good.</b>

165
00:14:48,158 --> 00:14:51,661
<b>Anyway, I want to treat you to a meal
for all the trouble I caused.</b>

166
00:14:51,745 --> 00:14:53,163
<b>-Full-course meal.
-A killer meal.</b>

167
00:14:55,665 --> 00:14:58,502
<b>Come on. You should hang with us.
You're spoiling the mood.</b>

168
00:15:02,923 --> 00:15:03,840
<b>See you out front.</b>

169
00:15:07,344 --> 00:15:09,137
<b>He likes free food, I guess.</b>

170
00:15:21,358 --> 00:15:22,442
<b>Let's do this.</b>

171
00:15:29,574 --> 00:15:31,743
<b>-Rock-paper-scissors.
-Rock-paper-scissors.</b>

172
00:15:43,588 --> 00:15:44,881
<b>Here I go.</b>

173
00:15:50,345 --> 00:15:52,431
<b>Wow. Nice shot.</b>

174
00:15:52,514 --> 00:15:54,558
<b>Damn it. That was a mistake.</b>

175
00:15:55,601 --> 00:15:56,810
<b>Number nine.</b>

176

<b>-Tae-woong, the pink ball.
-Be quiet.</b>

<b>Raise it at a 45-degree angle.</b>

178

<b>-What was that?
-You need more than</b>

179
00:16:16,663 --> 00:16:18,874
<b>just your strength to play pool. You know?</b>

180
00:16:19,124 --> 00:16:21,084
<b>-My gosh.
-You need techniques.</b>

181
00:16:21,668 --> 00:16:23,295
<b>Don't be so angry.</b>

182
00:16:23,378 --> 00:16:25,171
<b>Try again. I'll give you one more chance.</b>

183
00:16:32,846 --> 00:16:36,057
<b>When will that stop? We need to play, too.</b>

184
00:16:52,533 --> 00:16:54,451
<b>Nice!</b>

185
00:16:57,037 --> 00:17:00,290
<b>Come on. Try to lighten up.
I can't play when you scare me like that.</b>

186
00:17:00,373 --> 00:17:03,585
<b>We don't have time to go out and eat.
Let's order Chinese.</b>

187

<b>No, I'll buy you a nice meal.
It's almost over. Let's go out.</b>

188

<b>Don't you dare move an inch.</b>

189

<b>What are you doing? That's cheating.</b>

190

<b>The ball...</b>

191
00:17:21,227 --> 00:17:22,687
<b>Unbelievable.</b>

192

<b>Is she your golden goose?</b>

193
00:18:26,876 --> 00:18:28,837
<b>Or does she have ambitions?</b>

194
00:18:29,379 --> 00:18:31,464
<b>Why? Does she remind you of your old self?</b>

195
00:18:32,632 --> 00:18:34,759
<b>I don't care who I used to be.</b>

196
00:18:36,261 --> 00:18:38,304
<b>Why don't we talk about the kind of person</b>

<b>I will be in the future?</b>

198

<b>I take that you can't really communicate

199

<b>We worked very well

<b>If you want to reminisce about your past</b>

<b>I won't stop you.</b>

203

<b>Why did you go after Bong Man-cheol?</b>

204
00:18:57,657 --> 00:18:58,783
<b>That wasn't me.</b>

205
00:18:58,867 --> 00:19:00,952
<b>You'll get swept away with that attitude.</b>

206
00:19:01,494 --> 00:19:02,871
<b>Choi Yong is crazy about money.</b>

207
00:19:03,747 --> 00:19:05,373
<b>He'll take it out on someone.</b>

208

<b>Will you be the victim

<b>I'm dying to find out
what you will choose.</b>

210

<b>Have you heard anything
about someone named Gu Won-bong?</b>

211
00:19:21,306 --> 00:19:22,474
<b>Gu Won-bong?</b>

212
00:19:27,395 --> 00:19:30,815
<b>All I did was follow this beautiful voice.</b>

213

<b>Seeing a beautiful sight is a bonus.</b>

214
00:19:34,027 --> 00:19:36,362
<b>You should have told me
that you were coming.</b>

215
00:19:36,821 --> 00:19:39,532
<b>We haven't opened yet.
You're too generous with your compliment.</b>

216
00:19:39,616 --> 00:19:41,451
<b>No. I didn't mean her.</b>

217
00:19:42,994 --> 00:19:44,329
<b>I meant the two of you.</b>

218

<b>Everyone is at each other's throat.</b>

219

<b>If you're that concerned about him,</b>

223
00:20:04,474 --> 00:20:06,768
<b>you should go visit him and report back.</b>

224
00:20:13,399 --> 00:20:14,442
<b>You're right.</b>

225
00:20:15,777 --> 00:20:19,239
<b>He must have a lot of questions for us.
Don't you agree?</b>

226
00:20:21,241 --> 00:20:23,201
<b>You must be busy setting up
your new business.</b>

227
00:20:23,785 --> 00:20:25,578
<b>There will be a good show

<b>Come and enjoy yourself.</b>

229
00:20:27,956 --> 00:20:28,998
<b>A show?</b>

230
00:20:29,707 --> 00:20:32,585
<b>Discuss your new business
while watching the show. It might help.</b>

231
00:20:33,169 --> 00:20:34,337
<b>You seem to have</b>

232
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,965
<b>a lot of interest in me.</b>

233
00:20:38,216 --> 00:20:39,425
<b>This is nothing for my family.</b>

234
00:20:40,051 --> 00:20:41,177
<b>That sounds fun.</b>

235
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:44,305
<b>I'll make sure I stop by.</b>

236
00:20:57,152 --> 00:20:59,487
<b>By the way, why did you all take my side?</b>

237
00:20:59,988 --> 00:21:02,115
<b>Come on.
I wouldn't call that taking your side.</b>

238
00:21:02,198 --> 00:21:04,784
<b>I wasn't taking your side.
I would have done the same thing.</b>

239
00:21:06,744 --> 00:21:08,246
<b>If we were together, we could've caught</b>

<b>"Together"?</b>

242
00:21:15,003 --> 00:21:17,172
<b>We banded together based on
our loneliness and tragedies.</b>

243
00:21:18,047 --> 00:21:20,425
<b>I don't want to be part of it
on a deep level like that.</b>

244
00:21:21,801 --> 00:21:25,054
<b>But it was nice to hang out with people.
It's been a long while.</b>

245

<b>That's Seol Min-jun.</b>

303
00:25:51,663 --> 00:25:53,248
<b>Calling Tae-woong, over.</b>

304
00:25:54,791 --> 00:25:56,751
<b><i>Calling team leader Han Tae-woong, over.</i></b>

305
00:26:00,964 --> 00:26:01,839
<b>What is it?</b>

306
00:26:01,923 --> 00:26:04,842
<b><i>Tae-woong,
are you just going to leave me here alone?</i></b>

307
00:26:05,718 --> 00:26:07,011
<b>The other two are there with you.</b>

308
00:26:08,972 --> 00:26:11,557
<b>-Jazz isn't my thing.
-And that place isn't fit for me.</b>

309
00:26:11,641 --> 00:26:13,685
<b>Someone might remember me.</b>

310
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:17,063
<b>Tae-woong,
I think this place is totally safe.</b>

311
00:26:18,022 --> 00:26:19,649
<b>Let's just have some fun today.</b>

312
00:26:19,732 --> 00:26:21,943
<b><i>-I'm busy at the moment.</i>
-Come hang out with me...</b>

313
00:26:47,385 --> 00:26:48,761
<b>You don't need to worry.</b>

314
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,431
<b>Just do what you were told to do.</b>

315
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,063
<b>Report everything to me.</b>

316
00:26:59,605 --> 00:27:00,606
<b>Yes, sir.</b>

317
00:27:30,219 --> 00:27:31,596
<b>You have a nice voice.</b>

318
00:27:33,681 --> 00:27:34,724
<b>Is this like your side job?</b>

319
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:38,686
<b>Yes, I help out occasionally
when they're busy.</b>

320
00:27:39,437 --> 00:27:41,314
<b>I'm quite busy at the moment myself.</b>

321
00:27:41,814 --> 00:27:43,107
<b>Can I ask you a favor?</b>

322
00:27:43,816 --> 00:27:44,817
<b>Pardon?</b>

323
00:27:46,736 --> 00:27:47,737
<b>It's nothing hard.</b>

324
00:27:48,988 --> 00:27:51,240
<b>There's a briefcase
in the front passenger seat of my car.</b>

325
00:27:51,324 --> 00:27:52,617
<b>Can you go bring it?</b>

326
00:27:53,785 --> 00:27:55,620
<b>That's all?</b>

327
00:27:56,204 --> 00:27:59,248
<b>There's something sensitive inside,
so don't open it.</b>

328
00:28:00,124 --> 00:28:00,958
<b>Okay.</b>

329
00:29:00,059 --> 00:29:01,060
<b>Mr. Seol.</b>

330
00:29:21,372 --> 00:29:22,582
<b>-We'll take care of this.
-Hey.</b>

331
00:29:23,458 --> 00:29:24,667
<b>Hands off.</b>

332
00:29:26,544 --> 00:29:29,046
<b>Dal-ho, this is our turf.</b>

333
00:29:29,505 --> 00:29:30,840
<b>I don't want to cause trouble.</b>

334
00:29:30,923 --> 00:29:33,342
<b>You rude jerk.</b>

335
00:29:35,303 --> 00:29:37,722
<b>Hey, does "not causing trouble"</b>

336
00:29:37,805 --> 00:29:39,682
<b>make a problem go away?</b>

337
00:29:39,765 --> 00:29:42,351
<b>-We'll just take this briefcase.
-Don't even touch that briefcase.</b>

338
00:29:42,518 --> 00:29:44,770
<b>If you do,
I'll make you regret it big-time.</b>

339
00:29:52,612 --> 00:29:53,571
<b>Hey!</b>

340
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:01,204
<b>-Do you need a hand again?
-Run!</b>

341
00:30:01,287 --> 00:30:03,789
<b>-Guys, get them!
-What the hell?</b>

342
00:30:11,297 --> 00:30:12,423
<b>Hey!</b>

343
00:30:37,114 --> 00:30:39,325
<b>Mr. Bong, what brings you here?</b>

344
00:30:39,408 --> 00:30:42,119
<b>There was that misunderstanding
because of my guys.</b>

345
00:30:42,912 --> 00:30:46,707
<b>Also, I haven't given you my answer
as to whose side I will take.</b>

346
00:30:48,417 --> 00:30:51,504
<b>I'm headed to Mr. Seol's show,
so I don't have time for this.</b>

347
00:30:51,587 --> 00:30:53,256
<b>Then when will you have some time?</b>

348
00:30:53,339 --> 00:30:54,757
<b>I'm not sure.</b>

349
00:30:55,049 --> 00:30:58,928
<b>I'll have to think about whether
I'll summon you or visit you myself.</b>

350
00:31:03,975 --> 00:31:06,686
<b>It won't be easy
even if we bend over backward.</b>

351
00:31:06,769 --> 00:31:09,981
<b>Obviously. I mean, look at her living
at Chairman Ko's house even after he died.</b>

352
00:31:20,575 --> 00:31:22,368
<b>What the hell are you doing?</b>

353
00:31:23,244 --> 00:31:25,871
<b>Shouldn't you have better manners
as someone who owns a jazz bar?</b>

354
00:31:26,664 --> 00:31:27,582
<b>Knock before coming in.</b>

355
00:31:28,165 --> 00:31:30,793
<b>What the hell are you trying to do
at my place of business?</b>

356
00:31:31,294 --> 00:31:32,295
<b>Hey, Seol Min-jun.</b>

357
00:31:32,878 --> 00:31:35,923
<b>Do you think no one's above you
now that you run this swanky business?</b>

358
00:31:36,257 --> 00:31:37,258
<b>Go do your work.</b>

359
00:31:37,341 --> 00:31:40,303
<b>And it is your job to make
ugly things look nice.</b>

360
00:31:40,386 --> 00:31:41,887
<b>It was so hard</b>

361
00:31:42,555 --> 00:31:45,057
<b>to improve Argos' public image
to what it is now.</b>

362
00:31:45,141 --> 00:31:46,183
<b>Don't turn something little</b>

363
00:31:47,018 --> 00:31:48,269
<b>into a big problem.</b>

364
00:31:48,853 --> 00:31:50,730
<b>You look like you're about to beat me up.</b>

365
00:32:01,532 --> 00:32:02,617
<b>Why are you standing there?</b>

366
00:32:03,701 --> 00:32:04,952
<b>Go sort out the mess.</b>

367
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:07,264
<b>Thank you.</b>

368
00:33:07,765 --> 00:33:09,725
<b>We'll be back</b>

369
00:33:10,101 --> 00:33:11,852
<b>after the intermission.</b>

370
00:33:18,651 --> 00:33:19,485
<b>Oh, hello.</b>

371
00:33:26,659 --> 00:33:28,369
<b>-What the hell?
-Gosh!</b>

372
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:36,168
<b>-Gi-beom.
-Wait outside, Mi-na.</b>

373
00:33:36,252 --> 00:33:37,586
<b>-I'll go with you.
-I'll figure out</b>

374
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:39,839
<b>the situation and call you.
Make sure everyone evacuates.</b>

375
00:33:39,922 --> 00:33:41,132
<b>Okay.</b>

376
00:33:41,298 --> 00:33:43,092
<b>This way, please.</b>

377
00:33:43,175 --> 00:33:44,135
<b><i>We're closing up due to</i></b>

378
00:33:44,218 --> 00:33:45,678
<b>-<i>an unexpected disturbance.</i>
-This way.</b>

379
00:33:45,761 --> 00:33:47,722
<b>-Hurry!
-<i>Please follow the security guards</i></b>

380
00:33:47,805 --> 00:33:50,057
<b>-<i>and leave immediately.</i>
-Shit!</b>

381
00:33:50,141 --> 00:33:52,643
<b><i>We will be contacting you individually</i></b>

382
00:33:53,436 --> 00:33:56,355
<b><i>regarding your ticket refund.</i></b>

383
00:34:27,970 --> 00:34:28,804
<b>This way.</b>

384
00:34:29,346 --> 00:34:32,141
<b>-What's going on?
-Argos got attacked.</b>

385
00:34:32,224 --> 00:34:33,851
<b>What? By who?</b>

386
00:34:34,185 --> 00:34:35,895
<b>They were strange.</b>

387
00:34:36,437 --> 00:34:37,521
<b>Gi-beom is still inside.</b>

388
00:34:37,605 --> 00:34:39,106
<b>Please help him out.</b>

389
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:40,483
<b>Okay.</b>

390
00:34:40,983 --> 00:34:42,651
<b>By the way, where's Gwang-cheol?</b>

391
00:34:42,735 --> 00:34:44,528
<b>I thought he was with you.</b>

392
00:34:45,988 --> 00:34:48,449
<b>Gwang-cheol. Lee Gwang-cheol.</b>

393
00:34:49,283 --> 00:34:50,659
<b>Answer me.</b>

394
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,119
<b>Gwang-cheol.</b>

395
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:20,648
<b>Freeze them and grind them up!</b>

396
00:35:37,206 --> 00:35:38,916
<b>If we can't get out,</b>

397
00:35:38,999 --> 00:35:40,417
<b>will we die?</b>

398
00:35:40,501 --> 00:35:42,044
<b>Don't say things like that.</b>

399
00:35:42,628 --> 00:35:45,464
<b>I'll call people who can help us.</b>

400
00:35:54,181 --> 00:35:55,641
<b>Damn it.</b>

401
00:36:01,188 --> 00:36:02,815
<b>Hey, you three. Stop.</b>

402
00:36:09,613 --> 00:36:11,407
<b>What the hell?
What's wrong with these guys?</b>

403
00:36:11,866 --> 00:36:13,117
<b>Who are you guys?</b>

404
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:17,204
<b>I asked you a question,
so you should answer it.</b>

405
00:36:23,002 --> 00:36:25,880
<b>Jeez, I guess talking is useless.</b>

406
00:36:27,006 --> 00:36:28,340
<b>Come at me, then.</b>

407
00:36:28,424 --> 00:36:29,383
<b>Oh, wait.</b>

408
00:36:30,134 --> 00:36:31,218
<b>I'll come.</b>

409
00:36:50,237 --> 00:36:52,823
<b>Tae-woong, how long can he last</b>

410
00:36:52,907 --> 00:36:54,491
<b>without the batteries?</b>

411
00:36:57,912 --> 00:36:59,538
<b>Go start the car.</b>

412
00:37:00,122 --> 00:37:01,498
<b>I'll bring Gi-beom.</b>

413
00:37:02,917 --> 00:37:03,876
<b>Okay.</b>

414
00:37:06,295 --> 00:37:07,796
<b>What was that about? My gosh.</b>

415
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,673
<b>-I have no idea.
-That was crazy.</b>

416
00:37:09,757 --> 00:37:11,258
<b>Let's just get out of here.</b>

417
00:37:14,595 --> 00:37:17,222
<b>Hey, who booked this bar for our show?</b>

418
00:37:17,306 --> 00:37:19,099
<b>Some weirdos showed up and...</b>

419
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,685
<b>-Damn it.
-Hey, get him!</b>

420
00:37:21,769 --> 00:37:24,438
<b>No idea. I nearly died.</b>

421
00:37:26,649 --> 00:37:29,485
<b>I was terrified, so I ran out of there.
Can you come and--</b>

422
00:37:29,693 --> 00:37:31,111
<b>What the hell? Who are you guys?</b>

423
00:37:31,904 --> 00:37:33,364
<b>Gosh, who are you?</b>

424
00:37:33,864 --> 00:37:35,491
<b>Why are you doing this to me?</b>

425
00:37:35,574 --> 00:37:36,992
<b>Just come with us.</b>

426
00:37:58,055 --> 00:37:59,306
<b>Gosh.</b>

427
00:38:07,439 --> 00:38:10,234
<b>Do not tell anyone about what happened
and what you saw today.</b>

428
00:38:11,151 --> 00:38:11,986
<b>Okay.</b>

429
00:38:14,071 --> 00:38:15,656
<b>And about me as well.</b>

430
00:38:16,991 --> 00:38:18,158
<b>Okay, of course.</b>

431
00:38:48,063 --> 00:38:49,565
<b>Did you guys kidnap Gu Won-bong?</b>

432
00:38:49,648 --> 00:38:51,108
<b>Who the hell are you?</b>

433
00:39:07,916 --> 00:39:09,501
<b>What are you curious about?</b>

434
00:39:09,585 --> 00:39:13,130
<b>What the hell are you trying to do?</b>

435
00:39:14,089 --> 00:39:17,885
<b>You seem very curious, and I just wish
that you had asked me directly.</b>

436
00:39:25,309 --> 00:39:27,019
<b>Be gentle, will you?</b>

437
00:39:27,102 --> 00:39:28,353
<b>We need them in good condition.</b>

438
00:39:59,593 --> 00:40:01,595
<b>I'm the chairwoman of Argos. Step aside.</b>

439
00:40:01,678 --> 00:40:02,846
<b>It's too dangerous now.</b>

440
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:04,932
<b>You should get out of here.</b>

441
00:40:05,015 --> 00:40:07,810
<b>I must find out who caused this commotion.</b>

442
00:40:08,644 --> 00:40:09,812
<b>Take me there.</b>

443
00:40:13,398 --> 00:40:14,983
<b>Please open it.</b>

444
00:40:26,662 --> 00:40:27,955
<b>To tell you the truth,</b>

445
00:40:28,997 --> 00:40:31,416
<b>I've always been fond of you
since we first met.</b>

446
00:40:32,334 --> 00:40:34,962
<b>There are two kinds of people for me.
Enemy and prey.</b>

447
00:40:35,045 --> 00:40:36,755
<b>Most people get eaten up
of their own accord.</b>

448
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:40,926
<b>But from time to time,
I meet stubborn fools who rebel.</b>

449
00:40:41,426 --> 00:40:43,846
<b>That totally excites me.</b>

450
00:40:44,221 --> 00:40:47,349
<b>When that happens,
I have dreams every day.</b>

451
00:40:47,724 --> 00:40:49,977
<b>"How should I smother them?</b>

452
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:52,479
<b>How should I rip them to pieces?"</b>

453
00:40:52,563 --> 00:40:54,439
<b>It's so exciting.</b>

454
00:40:54,523 --> 00:40:56,567
<b>Just admit that you were afraid of me!</b>
