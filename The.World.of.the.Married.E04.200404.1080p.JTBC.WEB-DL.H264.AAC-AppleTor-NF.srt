<b>He really liked his grandmother.</b>

<b>Do you mean sex?</b>

55
00:08:10,925 --> 00:08:14,833
<b>Well, you can get it because
your immune system is weakened...</b>

56

<b>from fatigue or stress.</b>

57
00:08:17,534 --> 00:08:21,204
<b>And you can catch it from

<b>right, doctor?</b>

<b>You're sure I can trust that doctor, right?</b>

60

<b>You saw her ask me to
take care of her husband.</b>

61

<b>She's very quick,

<b>What?</b>

64
00:08:51,435 --> 00:08:55,375
<b>It is very unlikely it was caught

<b>I'm a doctor.</b>

<b>about the cause and

<b>Your conviction as a doctor. Sure.</b>

<b>but you're a married woman

<b>Depending on the situation,</b>

<b>That's right.

<b>He doesn't know how to keep secrets.</b>

<b>I never knew he was so whipped.</b>

<b>I think she got used to it now.</b>

158
00:15:46,715 --> 00:15:48,485
<b>She doesn't really ask for him.</b>

159
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,955
<b>Thank you for the ride.</b>

160
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:58,264
<b>Mi Yun.</b>

161
00:15:59,894 --> 00:16:00,965
<b>Yes?</b>

162
00:16:05,205 --> 00:16:09,075
<b>You know why I went to
the office that night,</b>

163
00:16:11,105 --> 00:16:12,304
<b>don't you?</b>

164
00:16:18,784 --> 00:16:19,945
<b>I'm sorry,</b>

165
00:16:20,945 --> 00:16:24,615
<b>but I'm not sure what you're talking about.</b>

166
00:16:33,294 --> 00:16:34,365
<b>I see.</b>

167
00:16:37,235 --> 00:16:39,335
<b>I'm sorry for wasting your time.</b>

168
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:42,475
<b>I better get going.</b>

169
00:17:14,365 --> 00:17:15,974
<b>That's not what I meant.</b>

170
00:17:15,975 --> 00:17:18,475
<b>I said, let's break up. Just leave!</b>

171
00:17:33,325 --> 00:17:34,384
<b>Get out!</b>

172
00:18:33,485 --> 00:18:36,814
<b>I saw your husband leave.
I think they had a fight.</b>

173
00:18:38,524 --> 00:18:40,225
<b>I'll look into the details.</b>

174
00:18:47,895 --> 00:18:49,334
<b>Are you upset about something?</b>

175
00:18:51,635 --> 00:18:54,334
<b>Not really. I just want a drink.</b>

176
00:19:00,145 --> 00:19:02,274
<b>What on earth were you thinking?</b>

177
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:03,874
<b>You know,</b>

178
00:19:04,445 --> 00:19:07,784
<b>I'm not saying this because
the donation was pulled out.</b>

179
00:19:08,284 --> 00:19:11,553
<b>You should've sugarcoated it
to avoid shocking your patient.</b>

180
00:19:11,554 --> 00:19:13,155
<b>The patient wanted to know.</b>

181
00:19:13,925 --> 00:19:15,593
<b>His wife was my patient.</b>

182
00:19:15,594 --> 00:19:16,725
<b>Exactly.</b>

183
00:19:17,255 --> 00:19:20,165
<b>Didn't you know she's the wife of
our hospital's biggest sponsor?</b>

184
00:19:21,794 --> 00:19:23,135
<b>I think...</b>

185
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:26,604
<b>making your doctor's conscience
the reason is overdoing it.</b>

186
00:19:28,505 --> 00:19:31,005
<b>To be honest, I know you relate to her.</b>

187
00:19:32,405 --> 00:19:34,405
<b>She was cheated on by her husband.</b>

188
00:19:38,945 --> 00:19:41,915
<b>As an onlooker,
I think you're taking big risks.</b>

189
00:19:42,715 --> 00:19:44,255
<b>The one who's taking risks is you.</b>

190
00:19:45,255 --> 00:19:46,255
<b>What?</b>

191
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:51,195
<b>I know you're a double spy.</b>

192
00:19:57,695 --> 00:19:59,135
<b>How much longer will you keep it up?</b>

193

<b>(Doctor Ji Sun Woo)</b>

194
00:20:17,685 --> 00:20:19,925
<b>I doubt I have to worry about you,</b>

195
00:20:20,155 --> 00:20:23,854
<b>but a hospital is a place
where many people frequent.</b>

196
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:27,465
<b>I came here out of concern.</b>

197
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:30,864
<b>You know Gosan is a small place, don't you?</b>

198
00:20:31,364 --> 00:20:32,635
<b>Please make sure...</b>

199
00:20:33,405 --> 00:20:36,635
<b>no one hears about our family's issue.</b>

200
00:20:37,034 --> 00:20:40,374
<b>I wouldn't leak personal details.
Please don't worry about that.</b>

<b>Do you...</b>

202
00:20:51,955 --> 00:20:53,284
<b>resent me?</b>

203
00:20:54,824 --> 00:20:56,255
<b>Would it have been better...</b>

204
00:20:58,425 --> 00:20:59,665
<b>if you didn't know?</b>

205
00:21:00,764 --> 00:21:02,235
<b>I'm not getting a divorce.</b>

206
00:21:04,495 --> 00:21:06,405
<b>People who don't know anything...</b>

207
00:21:07,064 --> 00:21:09,975
<b>will assume I'm living with
it for my husband's money,</b>

208
00:21:12,445 --> 00:21:14,705
<b>but we spend so many years together.</b>

209
00:21:16,514 --> 00:21:18,985
<b>Money can't be the only thing between us.</b>

210
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,084
<b>Will you be able to forgive him...</b>

211

<b>for the rest of your life relying

<b>He just...</b>

213
00:21:34,764 --> 00:21:36,534
<b>fooled around with a woman once.</b>

214

<b>There's nothing to forgive.</b>

215

<b>For men,</b>

<b>I'm the person who turned

<b>His background, wealth,</b>

<b>Please pick up your phone.</b>

224

<b>Are you going somewhere?</b>

225
00:23:07,554 --> 00:23:11,054
<b>Yes. Something came up at work.</b>

<b>I'm sorry, but I think I have to go home.</b>

<b>Is that what you thought?</b>

<b>I'm starting to question my entire life.</b>

00:35:12,718 --> 00:35:13,979
<b>Where is Min Hyun Seo?</b>

314
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:16,089
<b>Why do you want to know?</b>

315
00:35:17,018 --> 00:35:18,788
<b>You just worry about this.</b>

316
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:24,058
<b>This has your husband
going into that house.</b>

317
00:35:48,549 --> 00:35:49,788
<b>I want a deal.</b>

318
00:35:50,888 --> 00:35:51,919
<b>Got that?</b>

319
00:35:53,089 --> 00:35:54,259
<b>This is a hospital.</b>

320
00:35:54,888 --> 00:35:56,759
<b>- What are you doing?
- Exactly.</b>

321
00:35:57,629 --> 00:35:59,558
<b>Who'd be hurt more if
I start screaming here?</b>

322
00:36:07,669 --> 00:36:08,799
<b>What do you want?</b>

323
00:36:15,408 --> 00:36:16,509
<b>20,000 dollars?</b>

324
00:36:18,308 --> 00:36:19,379
<b>No?</b>

325
00:36:20,118 --> 00:36:21,248
<b>Then 30,000 dollars.</b>

326
00:36:27,788 --> 00:36:29,788
<b>I have no money to give a dirtbag like you.</b>

327
00:36:31,428 --> 00:36:32,998
<b>Have it ready next week...</b>

328
00:36:33,959 --> 00:36:36,079
<b>unless you want everyone to
know you hired someone...</b>

329
00:36:37,799 --> 00:36:39,328
<b>to tail your husband.</b>

330
00:36:47,678 --> 00:36:48,709
<b>Is Hyun Seo...</b>

331
00:36:50,109 --> 00:36:51,248
<b>safe?</b>

332
00:36:52,049 --> 00:36:54,779
<b>Why? Do you think I
locked her up somewhere?</b>

333
00:36:56,118 --> 00:36:57,288
<b>Hyun Seo says...</b>

334
00:36:58,419 --> 00:36:59,819
<b>she hates you.</b>

335
00:37:01,058 --> 00:37:03,029
<b>She says she wants to take
that money and end it.</b>

336
00:37:06,598 --> 00:37:07,759
<b>One week.</b>

337
00:37:26,549 --> 00:37:28,518
<b>You said you could
definitely get the evidence.</b>

338
00:37:28,979 --> 00:37:30,218
<b>What happened?</b>

339
00:37:31,089 --> 00:37:35,419
<b>You don't seem capable of
leading the fight in this war.</b>

340
00:37:36,018 --> 00:37:37,427
<b>At this rate,</b>

341
00:37:37,428 --> 00:37:40,058
<b>you'll be worse off if you get divorced.</b>

342
00:37:57,879 --> 00:37:58,908
<b>Doctor.</b>

343
00:38:02,018 --> 00:38:03,189
<b>What is it?</b>

344
00:38:03,919 --> 00:38:05,919
<b>Your husband must have sent these.</b>

345
00:38:32,549 --> 00:38:35,279
<b>(You are an amazing woman)</b>

346
00:38:43,388 --> 00:38:45,359
<b>Do you like the gift?</b>

347
00:38:46,498 --> 00:38:48,129
<b>Why did you send me this?</b>

348
00:38:49,498 --> 00:38:52,198
<b>Let's just say a friend is
sending you some comfort.</b>

349
00:38:53,339 --> 00:38:56,408
<b>Don't read too much into it.
It's client management too.</b>

350
00:38:56,939 --> 00:38:58,939
<b>Regardless, Tae Oh is my client after all.</b>

351
00:39:00,009 --> 00:39:01,738
<b>Thanks anyway.</b>

352
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:06,379
<b>You know, I don't think too much
when things are complicated.</b>

353
00:39:06,618 --> 00:39:08,419
<b>I don't decide with my brain.</b>

354
00:39:09,718 --> 00:39:11,549
<b>Things don't go as planned anyway.</b>

355
00:39:12,218 --> 00:39:14,018
<b>There's no answer in life.</b>

356
00:39:15,158 --> 00:39:19,388
<b>It's not bad to follow your
heart and go with the flow.</b>

357
00:39:30,768 --> 00:39:32,368
<b>Have you ever been...</b>

358
00:39:34,578 --> 00:39:36,308
<b>betrayed by someone close to you?</b>

359
00:39:39,948 --> 00:39:42,348
<b>Do you trust your husband?</b>

360
00:39:44,388 --> 00:39:47,157
<b>(Family Medicine Doctor Ji Sun Woo)</b>

361
00:39:47,158 --> 00:39:50,328
<b>The ECG and endocrine
function were all normal.</b>

362
00:39:51,158 --> 00:39:52,558
<b>The allergy test...</b>

363
00:39:53,928 --> 00:39:55,558
<b>didn't show anything unusual.</b>

364
00:39:59,498 --> 00:40:02,198
<b>Even you can't find the cause.</b>

365
00:40:04,808 --> 00:40:06,538
<b>I think it's more psychological,</b>

366
00:40:07,709 --> 00:40:09,479
<b>rather than physical.</b>

367
00:40:09,948 --> 00:40:12,209
<b>I'd recommend seeing a psychiatrist...</b>

368
00:40:13,979 --> 00:40:15,779
<b>I know my illness.</b>

369
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:20,089
<b>I don't need that.
Just give me my usual meds.</b>

370
00:40:20,819 --> 00:40:24,029
<b>Most people mistakenly think
they know their own problems.</b>

371
00:40:24,529 --> 00:40:25,658
<b>Don't do that.</b>

372
00:40:26,058 --> 00:40:27,828
<b>Why don't you get help from a professional?</b>

373
00:40:28,899 --> 00:40:30,268
<b>What about you, doctor?</b>

374
00:40:32,098 --> 00:40:33,698
<b>You have the same symptoms I do.</b>

375
00:40:39,268 --> 00:40:42,408
<b>- Mr. Ha Dong Shik.
- Don't try to handle it alone.</b>

376
00:40:42,908 --> 00:40:44,779
<b>Get help from a professional.</b>

377
00:40:49,149 --> 00:40:51,788
<b>Raise your feet and look at the ceiling.</b>

378
00:40:53,589 --> 00:40:55,158
<b>Lift your spine.</b>

379
00:40:56,089 --> 00:40:57,489
<b>Straight up.</b>

380
00:41:00,498 --> 00:41:02,029
<b>Keep your core engaged.</b>

381
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:06,497
<b>Back to the resting position.</b>

382
00:41:06,498 --> 00:41:10,168
<b>Look straight ahead.
Lift your knee slightly...</b>

383
00:41:10,169 --> 00:41:13,808
<b>and push your leg back.
Push it back slowly.</b>

384
00:41:14,209 --> 00:41:15,379
<b>Look straight ahead.</b>

385
00:41:17,078 --> 00:41:20,248
<b>Pull your shoulders back
and make your hip straight.</b>

386
00:41:20,819 --> 00:41:23,017
<b>Hold that position and push back.</b>

387
00:41:23,018 --> 00:41:25,649
<b>Not too quickly. Push back slowly.</b>

388
00:41:26,819 --> 00:41:30,058
<b>Relax your shoulders.
Keep your hips straight.</b>

389
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:35,899
<b>Back up.</b>

390
00:41:41,598 --> 00:41:43,169
<b>One more time.</b>

391
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:22,408
<b>I have three older sisters,</b>

392
00:42:24,549 --> 00:42:25,609
<b>so...</b>

393
00:42:27,178 --> 00:42:30,319
<b>I can tell by looking from
behind when someone's pregnant.</b>

394
00:42:38,359 --> 00:42:41,028
<b>- So?
- I wondered if that was it...</b>

395
00:42:41,029 --> 00:42:42,709
<b>when I heard this would be your last week.</b>

396
00:42:45,029 --> 00:42:46,198
<b>I'm a bit dumbfounded.</b>

397
00:42:52,038 --> 00:42:53,709
<b>I don't know what you mean,</b>

398
00:42:54,178 --> 00:42:56,979
<b>but if you have a problem with my
quitting, get a refund.</b>

399
00:43:00,248 --> 00:43:02,578
<b>I let things be with you...</b>

400
00:43:03,348 --> 00:43:05,518
<b>only because you were Director Lee's toy.</b>

401
00:43:07,819 --> 00:43:11,089
<b>But this changes things.</b>

402
00:43:11,928 --> 00:43:13,828
<b>I can't keep quiet anymore.</b>

403
00:43:17,868 --> 00:43:21,569
<b>Tell her. As much as you want.
That's what I want too.</b>

404
00:43:25,739 --> 00:43:27,009
<b>But you won't be able to.</b>

405
00:43:28,038 --> 00:43:30,758
<b>You were an accomplice, but now,
you act like you're a loyal friend?</b>

406
00:43:31,379 --> 00:43:32,448
<b>It's laughable.</b>

407
00:43:35,078 --> 00:43:38,419
<b>Do you think she'd back off
that easily even if she knew?</b>

408
00:43:40,359 --> 00:43:43,118
<b>She'd probably let you have a baby alone...</b>

409
00:43:43,459 --> 00:43:44,959
<b>and ruin your life.</b>

410
00:43:52,998 --> 00:43:55,899
<b>Haven't you ever thought that
Sun Woo may know everything...</b>

411
00:43:57,908 --> 00:43:58,968
<b>and is playing dumb?</b>

412
00:44:00,339 --> 00:44:02,678
<b>And Director Lee is dragging his heels.</b>

413
00:44:07,149 --> 00:44:09,319
<b>There's no cure for stupidity.</b>

414
00:44:19,729 --> 00:44:21,098
<b>Should we go out for dinner?</b>

415
00:44:22,428 --> 00:44:25,968
<b>Why don't we go somewhere
nice to cheer ourselves up?</b>

416
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:33,779
<b>I'll text you the address. See you later.</b>

417
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:35,279
<b>Okay.</b>

418
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:43,448
<b>What is it?</b>

419
00:44:44,018 --> 00:44:45,848
<b>I guess you're going somewhere nice.</b>

420
00:44:52,428 --> 00:44:55,459
<b>Have we not heard from the investor yet?</b>

421
00:44:58,069 --> 00:45:00,069
<b>Why do you have so many questions today?</b>

422
00:45:01,498 --> 00:45:02,569
<b>Sorry, sir.</b>

423
00:45:10,779 --> 00:45:11,879
<b>You know...</b>

424
00:45:12,649 --> 00:45:14,919
<b>why I went to the office that night,</b>

425

<b>don't you?</b>

426
00:45:31,799 --> 00:45:33,519
<b>(Lee Tae Oh: Pairing restaurant address...)</b>

427
00:46:08,799 --> 00:46:10,808
<b>Da Kyung, get in.</b>

428
00:46:11,308 --> 00:46:13,485
<b>What brought you here?
You didn't tell me you were coming.</b>

429
00:46:13,509 --> 00:46:17,209
<b>What do you mean?
I came because I missed you.</b>

430
00:46:18,748 --> 00:46:21,049
<b>You saw me now, so you should go.</b>

431
00:46:21,578 --> 00:46:23,549
<b>- I'm busy.
- Hey.</b>

432
00:46:23,689 --> 00:46:25,847
<b>How can I leave after seeing you so gloomy?</b>

433
00:46:25,848 --> 00:46:27,358
<b>Get in. Let's go shopping.</b>

434
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:29,359
<b>I have to buy clothes too. Hurry.</b>

435
00:46:29,989 --> 00:46:31,459
<b>Come on, honey.</b>

436
00:46:32,489 --> 00:46:33,698
<b>Come on.</b>

437
00:46:37,928 --> 00:46:39,428
<b>Hey, what do you think?</b>

438
00:46:39,629 --> 00:46:41,299
<b>Did it look good on me?</b>

439
00:46:43,368 --> 00:46:45,545
<b>Are you sure you don't want
that clothing from earlier?</b>

440
00:46:45,569 --> 00:46:47,479
<b>I'll buy it for you.</b>

441
00:46:48,538 --> 00:46:50,479
<b>Forget it. I don't need it.</b>

442
00:46:51,209 --> 00:46:54,718
<b>I think it'd look perfect on
you if you lose a little weight.</b>

443
00:46:55,118 --> 00:46:56,348
<b>Stop saying that.</b>

444
00:47:00,189 --> 00:47:02,158
<b>Gosh. That's so cute.</b>

445
00:47:02,388 --> 00:47:04,458
<b>How adorable. Gosh.</b>

446
00:47:04,459 --> 00:47:05,729
<b>Hello.</b>

447
00:47:06,959 --> 00:47:08,628
<b>- Hello, Mrs. Yeo.
- Hello.</b>

00:47:08,629 --> 00:47:09,729
<b>Hello.</b>

449
00:47:09,899 --> 00:47:11,399
<b>How pretty.</b>

450
00:47:12,598 --> 00:47:15,939
<b>Hey, come here. Help me pick out something.</b>

451
00:47:25,609 --> 00:47:26,779
<b>Why are you buying this?</b>

452
00:47:27,748 --> 00:47:28,979
<b>Is someone pregnant?</b>

453
00:47:29,118 --> 00:47:31,788
<b>My friend's son who is in
college knocked up a girl.</b>

<b>My friend's becoming a grandma next month.</b>

455
00:47:34,919 --> 00:47:36,589
<b>How immature, right?</b>

456
00:47:37,129 --> 00:47:39,959
<b>Those 20-year-old kids were so fearless.</b>

457
00:47:41,259 --> 00:47:45,128
<b>Not only is she becoming a grandma,
but she has to raise the kid too.</b>

458
00:47:45,129 --> 00:47:47,138
<b>I feel sorry for her.</b>

459
00:47:50,209 --> 00:47:51,439
<b>Just choose one so we can go.</b>

460
00:47:52,308 --> 00:47:56,038
<b>Hey. I don't want to
become a grandma too soon.</b>

461
00:47:56,609 --> 00:47:57,889
<b>Make sure you remember it, okay?</b>

462
00:47:59,279 --> 00:48:02,549
<b>Excuse me, could you wrap this up?</b>

463
00:48:02,678 --> 00:48:04,149
<b>Sure.</b>

464
00:48:06,248 --> 00:48:07,788
<b>This looks nice.</b>

465
00:48:22,198 --> 00:48:23,339
<b>Why didn't you wait inside?</b>

466
00:48:25,808 --> 00:48:26,908
<b>Well?</b>

467
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:29,284
<b>Isn't it nice to come out after so long?</b>

468
00:48:29,308 --> 00:48:30,748
<b>Joon Young, you must be excited.</b>

469
00:48:31,178 --> 00:48:32,578
<b>I'm happy to skip cooking.</b>

470
00:48:33,248 --> 00:48:36,149
<b>Are you excited to eat good food?</b>

471
00:48:36,248 --> 00:48:38,549
<b>I'm not a kid.
I don't get excited by such a thing.</b>

472
00:48:38,819 --> 00:48:39,888
<b>Then why are you excited?</b>

473
00:48:40,419 --> 00:48:43,629
<b>It's been so long since the three
of us came to a place like this.</b>

474
00:48:44,189 --> 00:48:45,328
<b>Anyway,</b>

475
00:48:46,558 --> 00:48:47,628
<b>it looks nice.</b>

476
00:48:47,629 --> 00:48:49,828
<b>You have a high standard.</b>

477
00:48:50,229 --> 00:48:53,169
<b>Of course, I booked the
hottest restaurant for us.</b>

478
00:48:53,328 --> 00:48:54,439
<b>Let's go in.</b>

479
00:48:57,538 --> 00:48:58,609
<b>Gosh.</b>

480
00:48:59,109 --> 00:49:00,209
<b>Dr. Ji.</b>

481
00:49:01,308 --> 00:49:02,979
<b>Fancy running into you.</b>

482
00:49:07,018 --> 00:49:08,819
<b>Did you have a meal here?</b>

483
00:49:09,319 --> 00:49:11,347
<b>We came without a reservation,
and they didn't have any tables.</b>

484
00:49:11,348 --> 00:49:12,448
<b>We were just leaving.</b>

485
00:49:13,149 --> 00:49:15,319
<b>I see. Take care.</b>

486
00:49:16,259 --> 00:49:19,489
<b>Why don't you join us, then?</b>

487
00:49:20,129 --> 00:49:21,698
<b>We have a reservation.</b>

488
00:49:24,129 --> 00:49:28,498
<b>Gosh. I don't want to be a nuisance.</b>

489
00:49:28,939 --> 00:49:31,867
<b>I wasn't sure how I could thank you...</b>

490
00:49:31,868 --> 00:49:34,739
<b>for your condolences.</b>

491
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:38,549
<b>If you're okay with it, please join us.</b>

492
00:49:41,848 --> 00:49:43,419
<b>Shall we?</b>

493
00:49:44,718 --> 00:49:48,618
<b>My husband is about to arrive,
so we were worried too.</b>

494
00:49:49,419 --> 00:49:50,558
<b>Would that be okay, honey?</b>

495
00:49:51,229 --> 00:49:52,428
<b>Sure.</b>

496
00:49:53,428 --> 00:49:54,498
<b>Yes.</b>

497
00:49:59,629 --> 00:50:01,998
<b>Honey, over here.</b>

498
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:33,669
<b>How's your dating life?</b>

499
00:50:40,979 --> 00:50:42,078
<b>Are you okay?</b>

500
00:50:43,408 --> 00:50:47,178
<b>Da Kyung is very social.</b>

501
00:50:47,678 --> 00:50:49,347
<b>She has many friends.</b>

502
00:50:49,348 --> 00:50:51,419
<b>That's why many people mistake her,</b>

503
00:50:51,518 --> 00:50:53,419
<b>but she says she doesn't have a boyfriend.</b>

504
00:50:54,419 --> 00:50:55,518
<b>- Is that so?
- Yes.</b>

505
00:50:57,359 --> 00:50:58,989
<b>Perhaps I heard wrong.</b>

506
00:51:06,399 --> 00:51:08,538
<b>I have to do my homework. I'll leave first.</b>

507
00:51:09,368 --> 00:51:10,439
<b>Okay.</b>

508
00:51:12,308 --> 00:51:13,368
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

509
00:51:14,308 --> 00:51:15,509
<b>We'll leave first.</b>

510
00:51:22,149 --> 00:51:23,948
<b>His dad loves him so much.</b>

511
00:51:24,419 --> 00:51:26,959
<b>No matter where they go,
they always stick side by side.</b>

512
00:51:28,158 --> 00:51:30,359
<b>A son is special to a dad.</b>

513
00:51:31,558 --> 00:51:33,628
<b>Since Director Lee is so handsome,</b>

514
00:51:33,629 --> 00:51:35,629
<b>I bet many actresses made moves on him.</b>

515
00:51:35,859 --> 00:51:37,828
<b>Of course. There were many of them.</b>

516
00:51:38,069 --> 00:51:41,698
<b>But Tae Oh is really
faithful to his family.</b>

517
00:51:43,038 --> 00:51:45,069
<b>Should anything ever happen,</b>

518
00:51:45,939 --> 00:51:47,138
<b>I believe...</b>

519
00:51:49,408 --> 00:51:52,348
<b>it's nothing more than
an excretion for men.</b>

520
00:51:55,319 --> 00:51:58,348
<b>You're right. All men make mistakes.</b>

521
00:52:11,768 --> 00:52:15,169
<b>Chairman Choi's wife decided
to look over his mistake too.</b>

522
00:52:16,839 --> 00:52:18,569
<b>He promised to give her a building.</b>

523
00:52:58,308 --> 00:52:59,478
<b>Hello?</b>

524
00:52:59,479 --> 00:53:01,479
<b>If you're a doctor,
you should watch what you say.</b>

525
00:53:02,678 --> 00:53:04,878
<b>Don't you know you have to
protect a patient's privacy?</b>

526
00:53:04,989 --> 00:53:06,818
<b>You told me he'd get a
divorce in two months...</b>

527
00:53:06,819 --> 00:53:08,288
<b>and have the baby with you.</b>

528
00:53:08,888 --> 00:53:11,428
<b>I thought you introduced
him to your parents.</b>

529
00:53:13,129 --> 00:53:15,249
<b>I'm sorry if I put you in
an uncomfortable situation.</b>

530
00:54:47,419 --> 00:54:49,819
<b>(Min Hyun Seo)</b>

531
00:54:54,928 --> 00:54:57,899
<b>(Min Hyun Seo)</b>

532
00:55:29,935 --> 00:55:31,046
<b>Who is it?</b>

533
00:55:35,546 --> 00:55:36,615
<b>Who is it?</b>

534
00:55:38,385 --> 00:55:39,446
<b>It's me.</b>

535
00:55:46,356 --> 00:55:47,426
<b>Hyun Seo.</b>

536
00:55:56,336 --> 00:55:57,506
<b>What happened?</b>

537
00:55:59,906 --> 00:56:01,006
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

538
00:56:02,276 --> 00:56:04,006
<b>But can I stay at your place for a while?</b>

539
00:56:10,745 --> 00:56:12,185
<b>I made up my mind.</b>

540
00:56:13,986 --> 00:56:16,385
<b>I decided to have an abortion.</b>

541
00:56:18,856 --> 00:56:20,824
<b>I'm not financially stable.</b>

542
00:56:20,825 --> 00:56:22,995
<b>And I don't have any
parents who can help me out.</b>

543
00:56:24,865 --> 00:56:27,635
<b>All I do is get beaten
up by the baby's father.</b>

544
00:56:28,665 --> 00:56:29,935
<b>I don't deserve to have a baby.</b>

545
00:56:31,006 --> 00:56:35,006
<b>My baby will only end up
with a miserable life.</b>

546
00:56:37,446 --> 00:56:38,845
<b>Don't look at me that way.</b>

547
00:56:40,075 --> 00:56:42,075
<b>I feel a lot better now
that I've made up my mind.</b>

548
00:56:43,015 --> 00:56:45,546
<b>My life is just as important to me.</b>

549
00:56:47,185 --> 00:56:49,615
<b>I don't want this baby to hold me back.</b>

550
00:56:52,785 --> 00:56:54,055
<b>I envy you.</b>

551
00:56:55,156 --> 00:56:57,116
<b>You don't need to worry
about this kind of stuff.</b>

552
00:56:58,426 --> 00:57:00,896
<b>You have parents whom you can lean on.</b>

553
00:57:01,765 --> 00:57:04,365
<b>And you're going to get married soon.</b>

554
00:57:09,575 --> 00:57:12,245
<b>What's the matter? Is something wrong?</b>

555
00:57:17,845 --> 00:57:18,915
<b>To be honest,</b>

556
00:57:22,785 --> 00:57:24,385
<b>my boyfriend is actually married.</b>

557
00:57:36,236 --> 00:57:37,566
<b>What am I going to do?</b>

558
00:57:41,176 --> 00:57:42,906
<b>This is driving me crazy.</b>

559
00:57:52,385 --> 00:57:55,215
<b>But you said he told you that
he's going to get divorced soon.</b>

560
00:57:55,216 --> 00:57:57,525
<b>He told me that he wants to get
divorced as soon as possible.</b>

561
00:57:57,526 --> 00:57:59,185
<b>He told me he can't stand her.</b>

562
00:58:01,396 --> 00:58:02,995
<b>But the problem is his wife.</b>

563
00:58:03,555 --> 00:58:07,435
<b>She's brazen enough to stay
married even if she finds out...</b>

564
00:58:08,736 --> 00:58:10,236
<b>about her husband's affair.</b>

565
00:58:12,506 --> 00:58:14,006
<b>What kind of woman is she?</b>

566
00:58:14,475 --> 00:58:17,176
<b>She looks down on people
and belittles them.</b>

567
00:58:19,805 --> 00:58:21,316
<b>She's extremely arrogant.</b>

568
00:58:21,946 --> 00:58:25,146
<b>He must hate living with a woman like her.</b>

569
00:58:26,716 --> 00:58:30,785
<b>Well, he told me he doesn't
feel sexually attracted to her.</b>

570
00:58:32,285 --> 00:58:33,925
<b>He only sleeps with her
every once in a while...</b>

571
00:58:33,926 --> 00:58:35,286
<b>because he feels like he needs to.</b>

572
00:58:35,856 --> 00:58:39,325
<b>But I'm not even surprised.
She's too old now.</b>

573
00:58:46,406 --> 00:58:49,336
<b>It's late. You've done enough.
Aren't you tired?</b>

574
00:58:50,776 --> 00:58:52,075
<b>I'm almost done.</b>

575
00:58:53,006 --> 00:58:54,345
<b>I'm going to go upstairs.</b>

576
00:59:16,265 --> 00:59:20,236
<b>(Min Hyun Seo)</b>

577
00:59:26,475 --> 00:59:29,145
<b>(Son Je Hyuk)</b>

578
00:59:29,146 --> 00:59:30,816
<b>Did you find an answer to your question?</b>

579
00:59:57,805 --> 00:59:58,946
<b>No, not yet.</b>

580
01:00:11,986 --> 01:00:14,595
<b>Are you free tomorrow?
Why don't we get a drink?</b>

581
01:01:32,665 --> 01:01:33,805
<b>Where's your mom?</b>

582
01:01:57,495 --> 01:02:00,466
<b>Eat fruit. Stop eating chips.</b>

583
01:02:07,305 --> 01:02:09,065
<b>Don't you think your
lips are a bit too red?</b>

584
01:02:12,106 --> 01:02:13,205
<b>Does it look weird?</b>

585
01:02:14,376 --> 01:02:15,575
<b>No, I'm just saying.</b>

586
01:02:23,115 --> 01:02:24,216
<b>What do you think, honey?</b>

587
01:02:26,356 --> 01:02:28,026
<b>Aren't you going to a workshop?</b>

588
01:02:28,825 --> 01:02:30,156
<b>I think it's a bit too much.</b>

589
01:02:31,796 --> 01:02:35,265
<b>I haven't gone out in a while,
so I dolled myself up a little.</b>

590
01:02:36,135 --> 01:02:37,966
<b>But neither of you seem impressed.</b>

591
01:02:40,665 --> 01:02:42,946
<b>It is a bit too much,
but that doesn't mean you look bad.</b>

592
01:02:46,906 --> 01:02:49,845
<b>I cooked dinner for you guys.
You just need to heat it up.</b>

593
01:02:50,245 --> 01:02:51,285
<b>Okay.</b>

594
01:02:52,185 --> 01:02:54,586
<b>Hey, I heard he's
transferring to another team.</b>

595
01:02:55,656 --> 01:02:56,816
<b>- Really?
- Yes.</b>

596
01:02:57,885 --> 01:03:00,485
<b>- Gosh, that's a pity.
- He was pretty good.</b>

597
01:03:00,486 --> 01:03:01,696
<b>My gosh.</b>

598
01:03:02,626 --> 01:03:05,325
<b>- I can't believe he's leaving.
- It's all about the money.</b>

599
01:04:00,646 --> 01:04:01,785
<b>You came here early.</b>

600
01:04:08,656 --> 01:04:09,825
<b>You look nice today.</b>

601
01:04:10,595 --> 01:04:12,796
<b>But then again, you always look nice.</b>

602
01:04:14,796 --> 01:04:15,966
<b>Can I also have some wine?</b>

603
01:04:49,336 --> 01:04:51,135
<b>I never even imagined...</b>

604
01:04:51,805 --> 01:04:52,906
<b>What?</b>

605
01:04:54,975 --> 01:04:57,635
<b>Being at a place like this alone with you.</b>

606
01:04:58,376 --> 01:04:59,506
<b>But?</b>

607
01:05:01,915 --> 01:05:03,475
<b>It's not so bad.</b>

608
01:05:04,946 --> 01:05:06,486
<b>It's just "not so bad"?</b>

609
01:05:07,816 --> 01:05:09,385
<b>I'll have to step it up.</b>

610

<b>Why do people cheat?</b>

611
01:05:23,336 --> 01:05:25,406
<b>There are two types of men in this world.</b>

<b>The ones who cheat and
the ones who get caught.</b>

<b>We can't overcome our instincts.</b>

<b>Men aren't...</b>

<b>the only ones with instincts.</b>

616

<b>Yes.</b>

619
01:05:58,765 --> 01:06:00,836
<b>I'll see you at the hospital soon.</b>

620
01:06:02,736 --> 01:06:03,805
<b>Okay.</b>

621
01:06:04,506 --> 01:06:05,575
<b>- Thank you.
