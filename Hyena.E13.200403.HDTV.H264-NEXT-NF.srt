00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:35,241
<b>and yourself.</b>

309
00:24:35,908 --> 00:24:38,745
<b>That's it. Don't think of anything else.</b>

310
00:25:03,394 --> 00:25:05,063
<b><i>He lost a lot of blood</i></b>

<b>Mr. Yoon!</b>

313
00:25:34,634 --> 00:25:37,553
<b>I asked my secretary

314

315
00:25:41,474 --> 00:25:44,227
<b>Don't worry about it. We're done anyway.</b>

316

317
00:25:54,529 --> 00:25:55,363
<b>What's up?</b>

318
00:25:58,282 --> 00:25:59,575
<b>My father</b>

319

<b>got into an accident.</b>

320

<b>You're not even surprised.</b>

321
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:15,675
<b>Is he seriously injured?</b>

322
00:26:18,052 --> 00:26:19,637
<b>I won't beat around the bush.</b>

323
00:26:20,471 --> 00:26:22,473
<b>You talked to him on the phone yesterday.</b>

324
00:26:23,933 --> 00:26:25,893
<b>What did you two talk about?</b>

325
00:26:25,977 --> 00:26:29,897
<b>Why do I have to tell you?</b>

326
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:34,610
<b>Since when were you curious
about our conversations?</b>

327
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:37,238
<b>-Sir.
-I'm...</b>

328
00:26:39,115 --> 00:26:40,616
<b>a little baffled right now.</b>

329
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:42,785
<b>You're talking as if</b>

330
00:26:43,202 --> 00:26:47,081
<b>I have something to do
with your father's accident.</b>

331
00:26:47,165 --> 00:26:49,750
<b>Then say that you don't.
Say it wasn't about anything important.</b>

332
00:26:51,502 --> 00:26:52,795
<b>Say that you spoke with him</b>

333
00:26:54,088 --> 00:26:55,548
<b>because you were worried.</b>

334
00:26:57,383 --> 00:26:58,843
<b>It wasn't a normal accident.</b>

335
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:01,220
<b>He tried to take his own life.</b>

336
00:27:02,847 --> 00:27:04,974
<b>Don't you know
what kind of situation Issume is in now?</b>

337
00:27:05,057 --> 00:27:07,602
<b>-Uncle Pil-jung.
-You know better than anybody else does.</b>

338
00:27:07,685 --> 00:27:10,021
<b>The company is shaken to the core
because of Ha Chan-ho.</b>

339
00:27:10,688 --> 00:27:13,065
<b>And the thing involving your father
broke out on top of that.</b>

340
00:27:13,483 --> 00:27:14,942
<b>What should I be concerned about now?</b>

341
00:27:16,777 --> 00:27:18,154
<b>If you're the ace of our firm,</b>

342
00:27:18,237 --> 00:27:21,157
<b>you should be concerned
about the same thing.</b>

343
00:27:24,535 --> 00:27:25,912
<b>The Inheritance Tax Act.</b>

344
00:27:27,538 --> 00:27:29,123
<b>I heard my father was against it.</b>

345
00:27:32,001 --> 00:27:32,877
<b>So?</b>

346
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,046
<b>Isn't that why
you're not concerned about him?</b>

347
00:27:35,129 --> 00:27:38,466
<b>Because my father is a roadblock

<b>-Yoon Hee-jae!

349

<b>I have known your father for years.
I really did my best.</b>

350
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:45,348
<b>Then allow me to put a team together</b>

351

<b>for my father's case.</b>

352
00:27:49,644 --> 00:27:50,853
<b>Song & Kim</b>

353
00:27:51,479 --> 00:27:53,022

<b>I beg your pardon?</b>

355
00:27:58,861 --> 00:27:59,946
<b>That will look</b>

356
00:28:01,072 --> 00:28:02,240
<b>much better.</b>

357
00:28:07,161 --> 00:28:09,789
<b>You were the one

<b>of Supreme Court Justice.</b>

359
00:28:12,208 --> 00:28:15,002
<b>And you were the one

360
00:28:17,588 --> 00:28:19,090
<b>From what I can see,</b>

361
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:23,177

362
00:28:24,679 --> 00:28:26,013
<b>Watch what you say.</b>

363
00:28:26,597 --> 00:28:27,723
<b>I will put together a team</b>

364

<b>to defend my father.</b>

365
00:28:33,896 --> 00:28:35,439
<b>Right here, at Song & Kim.</b>

366
00:28:57,003 --> 00:29:00,840
<b><i>You see, there's a company
called Issume Logistics</i></b>

367
00:29:00,923 --> 00:29:03,551
<b>It's a very small company,
and it's owned by Ha Chan-ho.</b>

368
00:29:03,634 --> 00:29:07,096
<b>His plan was to grow and merge it
with Issume Pharmaceuticals down the road.</b>

369
00:29:07,179 --> 00:29:08,639
<b>Having control over it</b>

370
00:29:08,723 --> 00:29:10,975
<b>means you have control
over the entire Issume Group.</b>

371
00:29:11,058 --> 00:29:12,310
<b>Because it's a holding company.</b>

372
00:29:12,393 --> 00:29:15,896
<b>However, he tried to grow Issume Logistics
using various illegal means,</b>

373
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:18,024
<b>so they're dealing with multiple lawsuits.</b>

374
00:29:22,194 --> 00:29:25,281
<b>They got a guilty verdict
in the first trial. Then Judge Yoon...</b>

375
00:29:26,532 --> 00:29:28,576
<b>Anyway, he issued a not-guilty verdict.</b>

376
00:29:28,659 --> 00:29:30,578
<b>So the company will be passed down to...</b>

377
00:29:37,043 --> 00:29:39,253
<b><i>An accident? He got into an accident?</i></b>

378
00:29:40,046 --> 00:29:42,089
<b>How did it happen?
Does it mean he's hospitalized now?</b>

379
00:29:42,173 --> 00:29:44,508
<b>-Which hospital?
-He's in the ICU,</b>

380
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,594
<b>so only his family members can visit him.</b>

381
00:29:46,677 --> 00:29:48,971
<b>He's in the ICU? Is he critically injured?</b>

382
00:29:51,724 --> 00:29:53,017
<b>We'll have to wait and see.</b>

383
00:29:57,938 --> 00:29:58,939
<b>Hee-jae.</b>

384
00:30:00,191 --> 00:30:01,484
<b>Are you all right?</b>

385
00:30:04,195 --> 00:30:07,448
<b>Don't worry about work.
You should stay by your father's side.</b>

386
00:30:44,819 --> 00:30:46,654
<b>-This will be the last time.
-See you around.</b>

387
00:30:47,238 --> 00:30:50,074
<b>That day,
Seo Jeong-hwa ordered room service.</b>

388
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,034
<b>I think she ordered a drink.</b>

389
00:30:52,118 --> 00:30:54,995
<b>Find out who took it to her room.</b>

390
00:30:55,079 --> 00:30:56,122
<b>Will do.</b>

391
00:31:06,132 --> 00:31:09,635
<b>There's a rug among the evidence
the police have. Can you check?</b>

392
00:31:14,557 --> 00:31:15,975
<b>-Have a good day.
-Thank you.</b>

393
00:31:17,393 --> 00:31:18,936
<b>Do you know a company named ArtSky?</b>

394
00:31:19,019 --> 00:31:20,438
<b>No, I'm afraid I don't.</b>

395
00:31:27,361 --> 00:31:31,115
<b>I'm not sure what kind of company
ArtSky actually is.</b>

396
00:31:31,198 --> 00:31:33,784
<b>Even people in the art industry

397
00:31:34,785 --> 00:31:38,122
<b>We must get our hands

398
00:31:38,205 --> 00:31:41,417
<b>I'd really love to get my hands on it.
I wish we had a warrant.</b>

399
00:31:43,043 --> 00:31:45,421
<b>What should we do when we don't have one?</b>

400
00:31:53,785 --> 00:31:55,579
<b><i>Ms. Seo Jeong-hwa told you about us?</i></b>

401
00:31:55,912 --> 00:31:59,040
<b>Yes. I've met the director a few times,</b>

402
00:31:59,124 --> 00:32:00,917
<b>but it's hard

403
00:32:01,001 --> 00:32:04,129
<b>That happens every time
when the director is abroad.</b>

404
00:32:04,671 --> 00:32:06,756
<b>Which company did you say you're from?</b>

405
00:32:07,382 --> 00:32:09,384
<b>AP EON. It's a private equity firm.</b>

<b>-Hello.
-You're back.</b>

411

<b>-The entrance of the parking lot?
-Yes.</b>

415

while carrying you that day.</b>

457
00:35:27,457 --> 00:35:29,125
<b>Come on. Your back is totally fine.</b>

458
00:35:40,678 --> 00:35:41,721
<b>What?</b>

459
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:46,226
<b>What will be discussed
at the EP general meeting?</b>

460
00:35:47,727 --> 00:35:49,521
<b>Dismissal of the managing partner.</b>

461
00:35:54,275 --> 00:35:55,735
<b>I mean, your dismissal, ma'am.</b>

462
00:36:00,115 --> 00:36:02,075
<b>-Where is Mr. Ma?
-At the other meeting--</b>

463
00:36:02,158 --> 00:36:03,535
<b>Where is Ma Seok-gu?</b>

464
00:36:15,046 --> 00:36:16,047
<b>What's up?</b>

465
00:36:16,131 --> 00:36:18,591
<b>It looks like
Ha Jun-ho will gain control over Issume.</b>

466
00:36:19,008 --> 00:36:20,343
<b>What great timing.</b>

467
00:36:20,426 --> 00:36:22,762
<b>Something like that can only be done now.</b>

468
00:36:25,682 --> 00:36:27,100
<b>I asked you why you're here.</b>

469
00:36:28,768 --> 00:36:30,603
<b>How did you persuade Kevin?</b>

470
00:36:31,062 --> 00:36:32,188
<b>Did you promise him Issume?</b>

471
00:36:35,859 --> 00:36:36,901
<b>I see.</b>

472
00:36:36,985 --> 00:36:40,780
<b>Now, I understand
why Kevin decided to join hands with you.</b>

473
00:36:41,156 --> 00:36:43,032
<b>With that idiot, Ha Jun-ho,
as a puppet CEO,</b>

474
00:36:43,324 --> 00:36:45,535
<b>you two can do whatever you want
with the company.</b>

475
00:36:46,494 --> 00:36:48,288
<b>You're talking nonsense.</b>

476
00:36:50,456 --> 00:36:52,208
<b>You're getting ready
for the election again.</b>

477
00:36:52,709 --> 00:36:55,336
<b>I suppose Issume will give you
quite the headache.</b>

478
00:36:56,546 --> 00:36:58,798
<b>As for Chairman Ha
and Supreme Court Justice Yoon...</b>

479
00:36:58,965 --> 00:37:00,884
<b>You can just blame them.</b>

480
00:37:00,967 --> 00:37:03,261
<b>But you were the one who recommended
Supreme Court Justice Yoon</b>

481
00:37:03,344 --> 00:37:04,220
<b>to the Blue House.</b>

482
00:37:04,846 --> 00:37:06,806
<b>And they went with your suggestion.</b>

483
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:09,225
<b>-Min-joo.
-What an interesting dynamic.</b>

484
00:37:09,309 --> 00:37:10,727
<b>Kim Min-joo.</b>

485
00:37:14,189 --> 00:37:15,315
<b>Watch what you say.</b>

486
00:37:15,398 --> 00:37:18,484
<b>I'm just trying to tell you
that I won't back down easily.</b>

487
00:37:19,235 --> 00:37:20,945
<b>My father started this law firm.</b>

488
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:24,157
<b>I won't let you steal it from me.</b>

489
00:37:24,741 --> 00:37:27,243
<b>You need to step down
if you're not capable of doing your job.</b>

490
00:37:27,619 --> 00:37:28,953
<b>That's only fair.</b>

491
00:37:29,412 --> 00:37:31,873
<b>That's what you think. It is your logic.</b>

492
00:37:32,457 --> 00:37:33,583
<b>Then prove me wrong.</b>

493
00:37:34,417 --> 00:37:36,753
<b>With factual proof,
not something you made up.</b>

494
00:37:37,837 --> 00:37:38,922
<b>Okay?</b>

495
00:37:46,387 --> 00:37:47,889
<b>I guess you still don't know this.</b>

496
00:37:48,473 --> 00:37:51,059
<b>Your father totally used me</b>

497
00:37:52,352 --> 00:37:53,436
<b>and deserted me.</b>

498
00:37:54,562 --> 00:37:55,813
<b>As for this firm,</b>

499
00:37:56,689 --> 00:37:58,816
<b>I didn't "steal" it. I made it mine</b>

500
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,109
<b>with my abilities.</b>

501
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:02,403
<b>And I grew it to what it is today,</b>

502
00:38:04,364 --> 00:38:05,198
<b>with my abilities.</b>

503
00:38:19,087 --> 00:38:20,255
<b>You don't need to worry</b>

504
00:38:21,714 --> 00:38:23,549
<b>about Supreme Court Justice Yoon anymore.</b>

505
00:38:24,133 --> 00:38:25,802
<b>I heard he got into an accident.</b>

506
00:38:26,928 --> 00:38:30,014
<b>Unfortunately,
accidents can happen anytime, you know.</b>

507
00:38:30,098 --> 00:38:31,307
<b>I guess you just never know.</b>

508
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:35,395
<b>Thanks to it, the Inheritance Tax Act
will pass without much trouble.</b>

509
00:38:38,231 --> 00:38:40,358
<b>You're almost there, so just keep it up.</b>

510
00:38:40,775 --> 00:38:41,651
<b>Okay?</b>

511
00:38:43,319 --> 00:38:44,487
<b>All right.</b>

512
00:39:07,635 --> 00:39:09,178
<b>We could've talked at work.</b>

513
00:39:09,262 --> 00:39:11,472
<b>You never make time for me.</b>

514
00:39:12,348 --> 00:39:14,017
<b>I guess you're very busy these days.</b>

515
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,769
<b>-Still, how could you just show up--
-This is my style,</b>

516
00:39:17,562 --> 00:39:18,771
<b>as you know.</b>

517
00:39:20,106 --> 00:39:21,858
<b>It must be about something important.</b>

518
00:39:22,734 --> 00:39:24,944
<b>I suppose that's why you showed up
unannounced.</b>

519
00:39:26,863 --> 00:39:28,239
<b>It's about the Ha Chan-ho Case.</b>

520
00:39:31,242 --> 00:39:33,077
<b>Was it involuntary manslaughter</b>

521
00:39:34,412 --> 00:39:35,830
<b>or murder?</b>

522
00:39:36,331 --> 00:39:37,957
<b>That will probably be the key.</b>

523
00:39:39,375 --> 00:39:40,376
<b>That is</b>

524
00:39:41,127 --> 00:39:43,046
<b>only if Ha Chan-ho is the culprit.</b>

525
00:39:48,676 --> 00:39:49,802
<b>Are you saying he's not?</b>

526
00:39:50,762 --> 00:39:52,472
<b>I have too many doubts.</b>

527
00:39:53,056 --> 00:39:55,683
<b>And as I investigate them one by one,</b>

528
00:39:57,101 --> 00:40:00,605
<b>I'll become even less convinced
that he's the culprit.</b>

529
00:40:01,856 --> 00:40:03,775
<b>Well, that is my job</b>

530
00:40:04,567 --> 00:40:05,985
<b>as his attorney.</b>

531
00:40:06,069 --> 00:40:07,278
<b>He has a clear motive.</b>

532
00:40:08,363 --> 00:40:09,405
<b>"Motive"?</b>

533
00:40:10,531 --> 00:40:11,866
<b>Seo Jeong-hwa's affair with Ha Jun-ho?</b>

534
00:40:11,949 --> 00:40:14,202
<b>Now, we need to move speedily
with the trial.</b>

535
00:40:14,952 --> 00:40:16,371
<b>Admitting to the crime</b>

536
00:40:16,871 --> 00:40:19,165
<b>would be one way of minimizing trouble.</b>

537
00:40:20,875 --> 00:40:24,629
<b>You know that Issume took a hit
because of this case.</b>

538
00:40:26,631 --> 00:40:27,673
<b>Wrap it up quickly.</b>

539
00:40:29,175 --> 00:40:30,426
<b>No.</b>

540
00:40:31,594 --> 00:40:32,720
<b>I'm afraid I can't do that.</b>

541
00:40:36,641 --> 00:40:40,937
<b>I'll do my best to make sure my client
doesn't experience any injustice.</b>

542
00:40:41,938 --> 00:40:43,314
<b>Even if that drags things out</b>

543
00:40:43,398 --> 00:40:46,859
<b>and makes people gossip
about the case for a long time.</b>

544
00:40:47,443 --> 00:40:48,861
<b>-Ms. Jung.
-One more thing.</b>

545
00:40:49,862 --> 00:40:51,155
<b>Seo Jeong-hwa.</b>

546
00:40:57,954 --> 00:40:58,996
<b>I plan to look into her</b>

547
00:41:00,289 --> 00:41:01,541
<b>properly as well.</b>

548
00:41:04,377 --> 00:41:05,545
<b>You can decide what to do.</b>

549
00:41:07,004 --> 00:41:08,756
<b>Don't show up unannounced like this.</b>

550
00:41:20,768 --> 00:41:22,353
<b>You're this uninterested</b>

551
00:41:23,354 --> 00:41:25,481
<b>in the Ha Chan-ho Case?</b>

552
00:41:28,359 --> 00:41:29,360
<b>You, of all people?</b>

553
00:41:41,747 --> 00:41:43,833
<b>ATTORNEY MA SEOK-GU</b>

554
00:41:47,462 --> 00:41:48,546
<b>It's me.</b>

555
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,174
<b>The thing you mentioned the other day...</b>

556
00:41:52,258 --> 00:41:54,135
<b>You mean, about Attorney Yoon?</b>

557
00:41:54,218 --> 00:41:55,553
<b>Go ahead with it.</b>

558
00:41:56,179 --> 00:41:58,139
<b>Call the president
of the Korean Bar Association</b>

559
00:41:58,723 --> 00:41:59,891
<b>and tell him to call me.</b>

560
00:42:00,224 --> 00:42:01,100
<b>Yes, sir.</b>

561
00:42:02,101 --> 00:42:05,521
<b>But what about Ms. Jung?
Are you thinking...</b>

562
00:42:05,605 --> 00:42:06,939
<b>We'll treat those two...</b>

563
00:42:08,274 --> 00:42:09,609
<b>as one.</b>

564
00:42:10,276 --> 00:42:11,277
<b>Got it.</b>

565
00:42:20,286 --> 00:42:21,329
<b>Me?</b>

566
00:42:22,121 --> 00:42:24,957
<b>That's right. You'll be in charge
of the Ha Chan-ho Case from now on.</b>

567
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:27,627
<b>What? You don't think you can do it?</b>

568
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:30,296
<b>It's not that.</b>

569
00:42:30,379 --> 00:42:32,465
<b>I just wasn't expecting this.</b>

570
00:42:33,674 --> 00:42:36,677
<b>As they say,
he who's ready seizes opportunities.</b>

571
00:42:37,261 --> 00:42:39,555
<b>Yes, of course. I'm more than ready.</b>

572
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:45,728
<b>What about Hee-jae and Ms. Jung?</b>

573
00:42:49,649 --> 00:42:52,485
<b>A report was filed
at the Korean Bar Association.</b>

574

<b>While working on Ha Chan-ho's divorce,</b>

575

<b>they sullied the dignity of lawyers

576

<b>Until the disciplinary committee
comes to a conclusion,</b>

577
00:43:04,539 --> 00:43:06,541
<b>we'll have to sit and wait.</b>

578

<b>However, we don't have that luxury.</b>

579
00:43:12,213 --> 00:43:15,466
<b>Quickly wrap up Ha Chan-ho's case
as soon as possible.</b>

580
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:18,970
<b>It's what Issume wants

<b>I heard that she personally
handled some pieces.</b>

584
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,743
<b>She was to sell a few of them</b>

585

<b>and leave the country with Ha Jun-ho.</b>

<b>-It's bad, Ms. Jung.
-Why? What is it?</b>

588
00:44:01,512 --> 00:44:03,264
<b>The Korean Bar Association</b>

<b>Because we dated?</b>

<b>Do they expect lawyers

00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:03,759
<b>Back then,</b>

611
00:46:04,552 --> 00:46:07,596
<b>death was the only way
out of the hellhole.</b>

612
00:46:10,057 --> 00:46:12,017
<b><i>It wasn't a bad way to die anyway</i></b>

613
00:46:12,643 --> 00:46:13,978
<b>At least, my death</b>

614
00:46:16,522 --> 00:46:18,816
<b>would serve some kind
of punishment to you.</b>

615
00:46:19,525 --> 00:46:22,445
<b>That would then stop you
from beating anyone else to death.</b>

616
00:46:27,199 --> 00:46:28,993
<b>But luckily enough, I lived.</b>

617
00:46:31,328 --> 00:46:32,580
<b>Eun-yeong.</b>

618
00:46:33,998 --> 00:46:35,291
<b>Forgiveness</b>

619
00:46:37,209 --> 00:46:38,836
<b>shouldn't be sought out by just anyone.</b>

620
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,715
<b>Especially a fucked up bastard like you</b>

621
00:46:44,508 --> 00:46:45,843
<b>shouldn't ask for it</b>

622
00:46:46,635 --> 00:46:48,053
<b>or even want it in the first place.</b>

623
00:46:50,097 --> 00:46:51,265
<b>Eun-yeong,</b>

624
00:46:52,433 --> 00:46:53,726
<b>I prayed for you.</b>

625
00:46:56,061 --> 00:46:57,354
<b>While serving my time,</b>

626
00:46:58,272 --> 00:46:59,273
<b>I prayed for you.</b>

627
00:47:01,275 --> 00:47:04,570
<b>That alone was enough
to make atonement for my sins.</b>

628
00:47:06,197 --> 00:47:07,573
<b>It's your turn now.</b>

629
00:47:09,366 --> 00:47:10,743
<b>The prayers were for nothing then</b>

630
00:47:12,953 --> 00:47:14,872
<b>because I haven't forgiven you.</b>

631
00:47:22,046 --> 00:47:23,297
<b>Get this through your skull.</b>

632
00:47:25,132 --> 00:47:28,928
<b>The woman in front of you
isn't the 18-year-old Jung Eun-yeong.</b>

633
00:47:29,428 --> 00:47:31,722
<b>If I need to,
I'll gladly pick up the knife again.</b>

634
00:47:32,973 --> 00:47:34,141
<b>But this time,</b>

635
00:47:35,810 --> 00:47:38,020
<b>I'll stab you instead of stabbing me.</b>

636
00:47:39,438 --> 00:47:41,482
<b>It'll be ruled as self-defense though.</b>

637
00:47:43,234 --> 00:47:45,069
<b>Because I'm that good of a lawyer.</b>

638
00:47:47,071 --> 00:47:49,949
<b>Don't you ever show your face to me again</b>

639
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:54,662
<b>and shove your bullshit
back down your throat.</b>

640
00:48:47,506 --> 00:48:50,342
<b>Ms. Jung Geum-ja
is waiting for you in your office.</b>

641
00:48:56,265 --> 00:48:58,100
<b>She said she made an appointment.</b>

642
00:49:09,236 --> 00:49:10,487
<b>What do you think you're doing?</b>

643
00:49:12,239 --> 00:49:13,240
<b>You tell me.</b>

644
00:49:14,658 --> 00:49:16,327
<b>What is it that you're doing?</b>

645
00:49:17,494 --> 00:49:19,288
<b>The Korean Bar Association?</b>

646
00:49:20,164 --> 00:49:22,291
<b>That was really fast. You put it in motion</b>

647
00:49:22,917 --> 00:49:24,585
<b>seconds after I met with you.</b>

648
00:49:28,672 --> 00:49:30,549
<b>Are you really that desperate?</b>

649
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:35,095
<b>I wonder what's been eating away at you.</b>

650
00:49:35,387 --> 00:49:36,430
<b>Why must Ha Chan-ho</b>

651
00:49:37,306 --> 00:49:39,224
<b>be found guilty?</b>

652
00:49:39,767 --> 00:49:41,477
<b>And this quickly, if I may add.</b>

653
00:49:43,938 --> 00:49:48,525
<b>So I've been racking my brain
to think of a plausible scenario.</b>

654
00:49:51,362 --> 00:49:53,656
<b>I already know
you're free for the rest of the day.</b>

655
00:49:53,739 --> 00:49:56,533
<b>It's why I took time off
my busy schedule to come here.</b>

656
00:50:07,378 --> 00:50:09,421
<b>What if it's not to help Issume</b>

657
00:50:10,297 --> 00:50:13,509
<b>but to sever ties with it?</b>

658
00:50:15,511 --> 00:50:16,804
<b>Only that makes sense.</b>

659
00:50:19,014 --> 00:50:20,808
<b>Ha Chan-ho must be out of the picture</b>

660
00:50:20,891 --> 00:50:24,061
<b>and the reins needed to go
to the ditsy Ha Jun-ho, not Ha Hye-won.</b>

661
00:50:24,144 --> 00:50:27,856
<b>Then, you were going to have Kevin
swallow Issume up.</b>

662
00:50:28,148 --> 00:50:29,942
<b>Issume needed to be shaken up more,</b>

663
00:50:30,025 --> 00:50:32,611
<b>-so you used Mr. Yoon's father--
-Ms. Jung!</b>

664
00:50:32,903 --> 00:50:34,405
<b>It was Kevin who reported</b>

665
00:50:34,947 --> 00:50:37,199
<b>Supreme Court Justice Yoon
to Prosecutor Kwon, right?</b>

666
00:50:39,159 --> 00:50:41,453
<b>I wonder who Kevin</b>

667
00:50:42,287 --> 00:50:43,956
<b>got the information from?</b>

668
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,126
<b>Why is it that only one person
comes to mind?</b>

669
00:50:49,503 --> 00:50:50,462
<b>So?</b>

670
00:50:51,755 --> 00:50:53,132
<b>What are you trying to say?</b>

671
00:50:55,843 --> 00:50:57,720
<b>So you admit to everything?</b>

672
00:51:00,264 --> 00:51:03,475
<b>I should at least hear out
someone who dares to threaten me.</b>

673
00:51:04,810 --> 00:51:06,979
<b>All threats lead to demands anyway.</b>

674
00:51:08,147 --> 00:51:10,524
<b>That's exactly how you,</b>

675
00:51:11,025 --> 00:51:13,485
<b>a lowly third-rate lawyer, operates.</b>

676
00:51:17,573 --> 00:51:20,325
<b>I'm not threatening you
and there are no demands.</b>

677
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:23,746
<b>I just wanted confirmation</b>

678
00:51:24,288 --> 00:51:25,622
<b>on Song Pil-jung's,</b>

679
00:51:26,999 --> 00:51:30,461
<b>I mean Mr. Song's intentions.</b>

680
00:51:35,257 --> 00:51:37,801
<b>I also wanted to tell you
that I've only just begun.</b>

681
00:51:38,385 --> 00:51:39,219
<b>This isn't over.</b>

682
00:51:42,139 --> 00:51:44,391
<b>The tea was refreshing.</b>

683
00:52:01,950 --> 00:52:04,369
<b>HANKOOK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL</b>

684
00:52:08,957 --> 00:52:11,251
<b>Look at you all gaunt.</b>

685
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:14,630
<b>-Is that you worrying?
-Are you eating properly?</b>

686
00:52:15,547 --> 00:52:18,842
<b>A haggard look isn't good on you.
It takes away the sexiness.</b>

687
00:52:26,141 --> 00:52:27,935
<b>The one injured is my father, not me.</b>

688
00:52:28,811 --> 00:52:31,021
<b>-Then give it to him.
-He can't eat properly yet.</b>

689
00:52:32,189 --> 00:52:34,024
<b>-Then throw it away.
-Actually,</b>

690
00:52:34,108 --> 00:52:35,859
<b>that's your specialty, not mine.</b>

691
00:52:37,694 --> 00:52:40,572
<b>Why can't you just thank me?
Is it that hard to do?</b>

692
00:52:42,741 --> 00:52:43,909
<b>Fine, I'll eat it then.</b>

693
00:52:49,331 --> 00:52:50,374
<b>Is this why you came by?</b>

694
00:52:52,167 --> 00:52:53,418
<b>How's your father?</b>

695
00:52:54,962 --> 00:52:57,506
<b>Thankfully, he's recovering.</b>

696
00:52:59,716 --> 00:53:01,593
<b>Now, tell me why you're really here.</b>

697
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,221
<b>Mr. Ga is in charge of Ha Chan-ho's case.</b>

698
00:53:04,721 --> 00:53:06,515
<b>We've been booted off the case.</b>

699
00:53:10,811 --> 00:53:13,397
<b>Then our suspicions
suddenly become more plausible.</b>

700
00:53:14,189 --> 00:53:15,399
<b>Mr. Song</b>

701
00:53:15,899 --> 00:53:18,902
<b>isn't just apathetic toward
my father's issue.</b>

702
00:53:18,986 --> 00:53:21,363
<b>No, he could've
orchestrated the whole thing.</b>

703
00:53:23,907 --> 00:53:25,284
<b>He's tossing Issume aside.</b>

704
00:53:25,367 --> 00:53:27,411
<b>Yes, all of it to Kevin.</b>

705
00:53:29,454 --> 00:53:31,498
<b>It's why Ha Chan-ho must be found guilty.</b>

706
00:53:32,166 --> 00:53:33,834
<b>There's no proof though.</b>

707
00:53:34,418 --> 00:53:35,627
<b>It's a dangerous conception.</b>

708
00:53:35,711 --> 00:53:38,422
<b>We were taken off the case.
That's our proof.</b>

709
00:53:42,426 --> 00:53:43,927
<b>-Also...
-There's more?</b>

710
00:53:44,761 --> 00:53:47,514
<b>The Korean Bar Association
is going to hold a disciplinary hearing.</b>

711
00:53:49,224 --> 00:53:50,976
<b>We'll be asked the same questions,</b>

712
00:53:52,144 --> 00:53:53,604
<b>so we should be on the same page.</b>

713
00:53:54,396 --> 00:53:56,481
<b>-As if we're not?
-Hold on.</b>

714
00:53:56,565 --> 00:53:59,026
<b>You'll say that you were tricked
into handing the intel over?</b>

715
00:53:59,109 --> 00:54:01,236
<b>It's true that I was tricked,</b>

716
00:54:01,904 --> 00:54:03,155
<b>but the intel?</b>

717
00:54:04,114 --> 00:54:08,243
<b>How should I know how you got
ahold of Ha Chan-ho's information?</b>

718
00:54:10,954 --> 00:54:12,664
<b>They'll ask about our relationship.</b>

719
00:54:12,748 --> 00:54:13,790
<b>I...</b>

720
00:54:14,625 --> 00:54:16,418
<b>will only speak of how I felt at the time.</b>

721
00:54:17,794 --> 00:54:19,463
<b>I remember it clearly, you see.</b>

722
00:54:19,546 --> 00:54:21,256
<b>Us...</b>

723
00:54:23,926 --> 00:54:25,219
<b>from how we began.</b>

724
00:54:33,310 --> 00:54:35,395
<b>Thank you. It looks great.</b>

725
00:54:37,606 --> 00:54:38,982
<b>I knew it.</b>

726
00:54:39,566 --> 00:54:42,945
<b>Gi-hyeok, I knew you'd make me proud.</b>

727
00:54:46,448 --> 00:54:47,616
<b>Gosh, I'm sorry.</b>

728
00:54:49,409 --> 00:54:50,911
<b>Let's sit.</b>

729
00:54:52,579 --> 00:54:53,455
<b>I apologize.</b>

730
00:54:54,206 --> 00:54:56,208
<b>I didn't think I'd be this happy,</b>

731
00:54:56,291 --> 00:54:59,002
<b>but my hard work so far finally paid off.</b>

732
00:54:59,086 --> 00:55:02,589
<b>Of course. No one is as prepared as you.</b>

733
00:55:03,090 --> 00:55:04,591
<b>Just how long did it take?</b>

734
00:55:04,675 --> 00:55:07,094
<b>You had to watch all your friends
become partners before you.</b>

735
00:55:07,552 --> 00:55:09,721
<b>I'm proud of how you hung in there.</b>

736
00:55:10,806 --> 00:55:13,392
<b>Anyway, I ordered your favorite.</b>

737
00:55:13,976 --> 00:55:15,018
<b>Here.</b>

738
00:55:15,936 --> 00:55:17,479
<b>Look at this melted cheese.</b>

739
00:55:17,604 --> 00:55:19,439
<b>I may finally make partner--</b>

740
00:55:21,566 --> 00:55:23,402
<b>-It's delicious.
-Isn't it good?</b>

741
00:55:25,279 --> 00:55:30,951
<b>Does this mean that
I should refer to you as a partner lawyer?</b>

742
00:55:31,451 --> 00:55:34,454
<b>Partner Ga, try this too.</b>

743
00:55:34,538 --> 00:55:35,747
<b>No one calls me that.</b>

744
00:55:37,416 --> 00:55:39,084
<b>Then be the first to be called as one.</b>

745
00:55:44,298 --> 00:55:45,382
<b>What is it?</b>

746
00:55:45,924 --> 00:55:47,259
<b>You seem worried.</b>

747
00:55:47,342 --> 00:55:49,011
<b>No, it's nothing.</b>

748
00:55:50,262 --> 00:55:52,014
<b>It's really nothing.</b>

749
00:55:54,725 --> 00:55:56,518
<b>I feel bad, that's all.</b>

750
00:55:56,601 --> 00:55:59,021
<b>Why would you feel bad on this happy day?
You shouldn't.</b>

751
00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:01,481
<b>Go on. Tell me why.</b>

752
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:06,653
<b>Someone reported</b>

753
00:56:07,362 --> 00:56:10,824
<b>Hee-jae and Ms. Jung
to the Korean Bar Association.</b>

754
00:56:11,616 --> 00:56:15,537
<b>The case only fell into my lap
because of it.</b>

755
00:56:15,829 --> 00:56:17,289
<b>What? How...</b>

756
00:56:17,372 --> 00:56:19,875
<b>If the disciplinary committee
dismisses the charges,</b>

757
00:56:19,958 --> 00:56:22,377
<b>I mean, rules in their favor,</b>

758
00:56:22,461 --> 00:56:25,005
<b>I could be robbed of this chance.</b>

759
00:56:25,756 --> 00:56:28,842
<b>What's worse is that
I need to testify at that hearing.</b>

760
00:56:29,593 --> 00:56:33,305
<b>I've worked most closely with them
at the office.</b>

761
00:56:43,190 --> 00:56:44,816
<b>This is wrong.</b>

<b>People must be loyal.</b>

<b>You must be to Hee-jae</b>

765

<b>and I must be to Geum-ja.</b>

<b>While working on
Ha Chan-ho's divorce case,</b>

770
00:57:34,574 --> 00:57:38,995
<b>is it true that you and Mr. Yoon were
involved in an inappropriate relationship?</b>

771
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:44,209
<b>What exactly do you mean by</b>

772
00:57:45,127 --> 00:57:47,671
<b>an inappropriate relationship?</b>

773

<b>COMMISSIONER KIM JUNG-SU,

774
00:57:53,093 --> 00:57:56,471
<b>I'm asking if you two were close enough
to share information.</b>

775
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:10,318
<b>Yes.</b>

776

<b>That's right.</b>

<b>COMMISSIONER GANG MAN-SEOK</b>

778
00:58:16,116 --> 00:58:20,245
<b>Ms. Jung approached you imposing
as Kim Hee-sun, an old friend from school.</b>

779
00:58:20,328 --> 00:58:21,746
<b>Is that also true?</b>

780
00:58:22,914 --> 00:58:26,668
<b>That has nothing to do
with this disciplinary hearing.</b>

781
00:58:26,751 --> 00:58:31,840
<b>Why did Ms. Jung willfully approach you
by telling such lies?</b>

782
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:36,761
<b>Wasn't it so that she could illegally

<b>No, sir.</b>

786

if I told him who I really was.</b>

787
00:58:53,612 --> 00:58:55,113
<b>It was my way of getting to know him.</b>

788
00:58:55,614 --> 00:58:58,909
<b>That's ridiculous.
He was the opposing lawyer.</b>

<b>No one can blame us for falling in love

you were being sincere with me.</b>

<b>I, too, am annoyed by how we keep
crossing each other's paths.</b>

797

<b>But the thing is, I get even more annoyed

<b>How does it feel to do things my way?
It's exciting, right?</b>
