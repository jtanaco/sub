(are unrelated to real life.)

4
00:00:31,754 --> 00:00:33,964
- My gosh. - Oh, dear.

5
00:00:50,074 --> 00:00:51,473
I hear something back there.

6
00:00:51,473 --> 00:00:53,074
A passenger is relieving herself.

7
00:00:53,074 --> 00:00:54,884
But I should check.

8
00:00:54,884 --> 00:00:56,183
Check on a passenger peeing?

9
00:00:56,183 --> 00:00:57,314
But...

10
00:01:03,153 --> 00:01:05,993
Why didn't you say anything after finding out who I was?

11
00:01:06,823 --> 00:01:09,223
It's you, isn't it? You're Michael.

12
00:01:12,534 --> 00:01:16,603
A good night's sleep will make you feel as good as new.

15

We're here already?

16
00:02:04,613 --> 00:02:05,713
What's wrong?

17
00:02:06,353 --> 00:02:07,454
I can't open my eyes.

18
00:02:08,483 --> 00:02:09,883
I can't open my eyes!

19
00:02:10,223 --> 00:02:11,654
Oh my goodness.

20
00:02:12,494 --> 00:02:13,994
Did you eat peanuts?

21
00:02:13,994 --> 00:02:16,864
Don't you know I don't touch them because I'm allergic?

22
00:02:17,594 --> 00:02:18,633
Wait.

23

(Pistachio cookies made from locally-grown wheat)

24
00:02:19,893 --> 00:02:21,904
Did you eat pistachios?

25
00:02:21,904 --> 00:02:25,034
I ate pistachios but not peanuts!

26
00:02:35,844 --> 00:02:38,483
Keep hold of my hand and just follow me.

(Taipei International Airport)

28
00:02:54,304 --> 00:02:57,004
You know you wouldn't have made it if it weren't for me, right?

29
00:02:57,133 --> 00:02:59,034
So I'll lead the interrogation once we land back in Korea.

30
00:03:00,274 --> 00:03:01,874
You have no right to decide.

31
00:03:01,943 --> 00:03:04,543
I'm the team leader, not you.

32
00:03:05,744 --> 00:03:09,084
Competence is more important than rank.

33
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,013
You're always so inflexible,

34
00:03:11,013 --> 00:03:12,983
and that's why you always get passed over for promotions.

35
00:03:14,323 --> 00:03:16,284
What's the use of being a skilled agent?

36
00:03:16,284 --> 00:03:19,423
You never get good results because you fail to control your emotions.

37
00:03:21,223 --> 00:03:23,223
- Verruckt. - You just swore at me, didn't you?

38
00:03:23,223 --> 00:03:24,594
(Verruckt: Insane, Crazy)

39
00:03:24,594 --> 00:03:26,094
I guess you've become more quick-witted...

40
00:03:26,364 --> 00:03:27,364
with age.

41
00:03:27,364 --> 00:03:28,703
Don't you get funny with me.

42
00:03:37,413 --> 00:03:40,143
You may begin boarding the flight to Incheon.

43
00:03:41,143 --> 00:03:42,214

00:03:48,184 --> 00:03:50,284
(Taipei International Airport, VIP Lounge)

45
00:03:50,284 --> 00:03:52,754
I promise you that Kang Woo Won...

46
00:03:52,754 --> 00:03:54,793
didn't eat those nuts on purpose.

47
00:03:56,423 --> 00:03:57,534
Yes, I know.

48
00:03:58,133 --> 00:04:00,564
Pistachios are also nuts.

49
00:04:01,103 --> 00:04:03,804
So I know he should've been extra careful.

50
00:04:05,274 --> 00:04:09,043
This is all my responsibility. I should've double-checked.

51
00:04:09,304 --> 00:04:11,344
Come back to Korea right now.

52
00:04:12,344 --> 00:04:13,983
Let's talk once you arrive.

53
00:04:13,983 --> 00:04:15,013
Okay.

54
00:04:15,013 --> 00:04:17,213
I'll call you as soon as I arrive...

55
00:04:32,533 --> 00:04:33,633
Water.

56
00:04:33,903 --> 00:04:34,934
"Water"?

57
00:04:44,143 --> 00:04:45,213
What is this?

58
00:04:45,914 --> 00:04:48,783
This isn't my usual French natural bedrock mineral water!

59
00:04:49,044 --> 00:04:52,953
They don't have that brand here.

60
00:04:52,953 --> 00:04:55,184
They may not have it in this lounge.

61
00:04:55,184 --> 00:04:58,023
But dozens of people visit this airport every day.

62
00:04:58,023 --> 00:05:01,523
Do you really think it'd be impossible to find that brand?

63
00:05:01,523 --> 00:05:02,593
Then are you telling me...

64
00:05:02,963 --> 00:05:04,434
to search the entire airport...

65
00:05:04,434 --> 00:05:05,794
And find me the water.

66
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:14,273
I can see you.

67
00:05:18,914 --> 00:05:19,974
I know...

68
00:05:20,143 --> 00:05:23,213
it's hard to stop looking at me.

69
00:05:23,213 --> 00:05:24,283
But...

70
00:05:25,184 --> 00:05:27,213
if you're going to look at me for more than three seconds, pay up.

71
00:05:29,984 --> 00:05:31,424
I have expensive portrait rights. You know that, right?

72
00:05:37,294 --> 00:05:39,033
She should know her place if she doesn't have any money.

73
00:05:40,934 --> 00:05:42,064
This feels nice.

74
00:05:42,703 --> 00:05:44,004
This feels great.

75
00:05:44,504 --> 00:05:45,633
How nice.

76
00:05:53,984 --> 00:05:55,713
You were saved, so now you must repent.

77
00:05:56,044 --> 00:05:57,143
Get the item.

78
00:05:57,583 --> 00:06:00,614
Pi Cheol Woong will be on a flight that departs...

79
00:06:00,724 --> 00:06:01,754
in two hours.

80
00:06:01,754 --> 00:06:03,054
Could you please sit down?

81

It's you, isn't it? You're Michael.

82

(Wash and Clean)

84
00:06:38,554 --> 00:06:39,724
- Let's go. - Yes, sir.

85
00:06:43,064 --> 00:06:44,664
Where to, sir?

86
00:06:44,763 --> 00:06:46,864
That place I told you about last time.

87
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:48,164
Instead of going to HQ?

88
00:06:48,164 --> 00:06:49,664
Just do as I say.

89
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:51,374
Okay, sir.

90

The receiver cannot be reached. You will be directed to voicemail.

92
00:07:10,854 --> 00:07:12,724
Check how things are going with the guys in Taipei.

93
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:15,994
Hey, Team Leader Dung.

94
00:07:16,463 --> 00:07:19,263
Don't ever make me wear a uniform again.

95
00:07:19,364 --> 00:07:21,164
I practically had to squish my body...

96
00:07:21,304 --> 00:07:23,604
into this uniform. How do people wear this thing?

97
00:07:23,763 --> 00:07:25,304
Why don't you lose some weight?

98
00:07:27,604 --> 00:07:29,643
This is my charm.

99
00:07:29,703 --> 00:07:31,174
Cut the nonsense.

100
00:07:34,914 --> 00:07:36,184
What? Did you get hurt?

101
00:07:36,744 --> 00:07:38,614
- Let me see. - No, I'm fine.

102
00:07:38,754 --> 00:07:39,883
You're not fine.

103
00:07:39,883 --> 00:07:42,184
Chief Tak hurt you, didn't he? Let me take a look at it.

104
00:07:43,484 --> 00:07:45,323
I should've checked over my shoulder.

105
00:07:45,354 --> 00:07:46,653
Let me take a look.

106
00:07:46,653 --> 00:07:47,664
No, I'm fine.

107
00:07:48,064 --> 00:07:50,424
Did you check if Ye Eun got back safely?

108
00:08:06,114 --> 00:08:07,414
Hey!

109
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:10,783
Will you please slow down?

110
00:08:11,114 --> 00:08:13,114
I'm not the one moving.

111
00:08:13,254 --> 00:08:14,283
What?

112
00:08:28,703 --> 00:08:31,004
Where do you think you're going without me?

113
00:08:31,604 --> 00:08:32,874
No, that's not it.

114
00:08:33,574 --> 00:08:35,944
It's just that my hands are really sweaty.

115
00:08:36,744 --> 00:08:38,614
Don't let go of my hand even for a single second.

116
00:08:40,513 --> 00:08:43,383
You have trouble trusting people, and you get scared so easily.

117
00:08:43,683 --> 00:08:45,614
How could you think of going to an overseas event...

118
00:08:45,614 --> 00:08:47,183
with no one else but me?

119
00:08:47,584 --> 00:08:50,124
This wouldn't have happened if you took your manager with you.

120
00:08:50,783 --> 00:08:52,523
I hate having a lot of people around me.

121
00:08:52,523 --> 00:08:53,994
And people from the agency get on my nerves.

122
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:57,893
He only cares about himself.

123
00:08:58,433 --> 00:09:00,964
He just wants to make me suffer.

124
00:09:01,933 --> 00:09:02,964
They don't like me.

125
00:09:04,433 --> 00:09:07,074
They like me as a celebrity since I earn them money,

126
00:09:07,374 --> 00:09:08,944
but they don't like me as a person.

127

You're dead meat.

131

00:13:41,484 --> 00:13:43,344
Why waste time explaining?

170
00:13:43,344 --> 00:13:44,484
Let's get to work.

171
00:13:44,484 --> 00:13:45,883
No, wait, ma'am.

172
00:13:46,484 --> 00:13:48,484
You won't dunk me in that, will you?

173
00:13:49,023 --> 00:13:50,283
You can't.

174
00:13:51,293 --> 00:13:52,454
Get the hammer.

175
00:13:52,454 --> 00:13:53,923
Okay. Hammer.

176
00:13:53,923 --> 00:13:56,494
Wait. Let's talk a bit first.

177
00:14:02,263 --> 00:14:04,063
What? Just a few seconds?

178
00:14:04,063 --> 00:14:06,433
You must keep it in at least five minutes...

179
00:14:06,433 --> 00:14:08,744
to make it nice and crunchy.

180
00:14:08,744 --> 00:14:11,444
My gosh. Darn you all.

181
00:14:11,444 --> 00:14:13,114
Yes. Do it over.

182
00:14:13,844 --> 00:14:14,913
Wait.

183
00:14:15,183 --> 00:14:17,084
Give me time to think.

184
00:14:17,084 --> 00:14:19,584
- Darn you. - No!

185
00:14:21,883 --> 00:14:22,954
Who?

186
00:14:23,724 --> 00:14:25,324
Wang Kai.

187
00:14:26,694 --> 00:14:27,754
Wang Kai?

188
00:14:28,893 --> 00:14:30,724
What are you doing with Wang Kai?

189
00:14:30,724 --> 00:14:32,633
Talk in chronological order.

190
00:14:32,633 --> 00:14:35,263
In... In Taipei...

191
00:14:36,263 --> 00:14:38,604
I'm supposed to meet Wang Kai...

192
00:14:39,433 --> 00:14:42,004
and give him the package.

193
00:14:42,303 --> 00:14:44,513
- What's this? - When I arrive,

194
00:14:44,913 --> 00:14:47,714
Wang Kai said he'd call me on that.

195
00:14:47,714 --> 00:14:49,614
Who gave this to you?

196
00:14:49,614 --> 00:14:52,183
I don't know who it was.

197
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:54,313
I really don't know.

198
00:14:56,954 --> 00:14:58,254
I think it's true.

199
00:15:00,694 --> 00:15:02,393
Make sure to flush the dry ice...

200
00:15:02,393 --> 00:15:03,523
down the toilet.

201
00:15:03,523 --> 00:15:05,864
Dry ice... Dry ice?

202
00:15:08,734 --> 00:15:10,403
You could burn yourself. Be careful.

203
00:15:10,403 --> 00:15:11,403
Are they good?

204
00:15:11,403 --> 00:15:14,303
This is my favorite ice cream flavor.

205
00:15:14,403 --> 00:15:16,504
How can ice cream be so hard?

206
00:15:16,504 --> 00:15:17,744
I can't scoop it up.

207
00:15:18,114 --> 00:15:19,244
- Give me some. - Here.

208
00:15:20,673 --> 00:15:21,744
Isn't it good?

209
00:15:22,744 --> 00:15:23,744
Do you want some?

210
00:15:23,744 --> 00:15:25,283
I don't want any!

211
00:15:27,053 --> 00:15:28,423
He wants some.

212
00:15:29,084 --> 00:15:30,224
Poor thing.

213
00:15:33,624 --> 00:15:34,724
Are you out of your mind?

214
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:38,163
Not only am I exhausted by the 10-hour round trip,

215
00:15:38,163 --> 00:15:39,334
but due to your poor care,

216
00:15:39,334 --> 00:15:42,334
I can barely see because of my nut allergy,

217
00:15:42,334 --> 00:15:44,874
and you'll leave me, top star Kang Woo Won to go?

218
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,334
Your being alone...

219
00:15:47,773 --> 00:15:51,204
without me would be a bit tough, right?

220
00:15:51,474 --> 00:15:53,344
What do you mean? Of course I'll be fine.

221
00:15:53,844 --> 00:15:55,013
Are you sure?

222
00:15:55,013 --> 00:15:56,183
Of course.

223
00:15:56,183 --> 00:15:58,714
Then can I really go?

224
00:15:58,714 --> 00:15:59,813
I said so.

225
00:15:59,813 --> 00:16:02,724
You are annoying, always in the way, and a complete nuisance.

226
00:16:02,724 --> 00:16:05,224
You are a huge headache.

227
00:16:05,224 --> 00:16:06,254
Yes.

228
00:16:06,754 --> 00:16:08,423
You were from the start.

229
00:16:09,663 --> 00:16:10,864
So you mean...

230
00:16:11,563 --> 00:16:14,163
I'm like fine dust particles.

231
00:16:14,763 --> 00:16:16,263
What a great analogy.

232
00:16:16,633 --> 00:16:20,074
You're not just fine dust particles. You're ultra-fine dust particles.

233
00:16:20,673 --> 00:16:23,173
I'll have no problem without the likes of you.

234
00:16:23,173 --> 00:16:24,303
You bet I won't.

235
00:16:25,513 --> 00:16:27,543
Call me if you need anything.

236
00:16:27,543 --> 00:16:31,183
The French natural bedrock mineral water that you drink...

237
00:16:31,413 --> 00:16:33,383
is right beside the couch.

238
00:16:33,883 --> 00:16:35,824
Your organic gluten-free snacks...

239
00:16:35,824 --> 00:16:38,754
cooked by the Italian chef are on the table.

240
00:16:40,224 --> 00:16:42,393
Your air purifying system is on,

241
00:16:42,393 --> 00:16:44,094
and so are the hygrometer and humidifier.

242
00:16:44,094 --> 00:16:45,094
Go.

243
00:16:46,563 --> 00:16:48,263
I'm really leaving.

244
00:16:48,734 --> 00:16:50,433
Are you still here?

245
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:04,654
She really left because I said so?

246
00:17:05,884 --> 00:17:06,954
Are you gone?

247
00:17:08,254 --> 00:17:09,283
Hello?

248
00:17:11,154 --> 00:17:12,154
She's gone.

249
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,664
I can't see properly.

250
00:17:25,734 --> 00:17:28,404
So, fortunately, we got the item.

251
00:17:28,843 --> 00:17:29,904
With this chip,

252
00:17:30,803 --> 00:17:32,573
we'll lure and catch Wang Kai.

253
00:17:33,313 --> 00:17:35,313
We'll use him to get to the buyer...

254
00:17:35,414 --> 00:17:37,914
and get the broker Michael as well.

255
00:17:38,714 --> 00:17:39,714
Simple, right?

256
00:17:39,853 --> 00:17:42,023
Simple, my foot.

257
00:17:42,724 --> 00:17:45,053
Wang Kai's in Taiwan.

258
00:17:45,194 --> 00:17:47,293
How are we to bring him to Korea?

259
00:17:47,823 --> 00:17:49,424
I think he'll come without us calling.

260
00:17:52,063 --> 00:17:55,803
Wow. The tracking device is as small as an ant's booger.

261
00:17:56,664 --> 00:17:57,863
The new model...

262
00:17:57,863 --> 00:17:59,833
is so small, it's the size of a mosquito's booger.

263
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:02,073
Darn it.

264
00:18:02,843 --> 00:18:04,343
Why is ours so huge?

265
00:18:05,214 --> 00:18:07,244
It's fine as long as we can track you.

266
00:18:07,513 --> 00:18:08,944
Does size matter?

267
00:18:09,144 --> 00:18:10,914
This isn't the time to complain!

268
00:18:11,513 --> 00:18:14,083
Even if the item's right here,

269
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:15,484
would Wang Kai...

270
00:18:15,484 --> 00:18:17,884
willingly come all the way to Korea?

271
00:18:18,523 --> 00:18:20,093
For hundreds of millions of dollars?

272
00:18:20,093 --> 00:18:21,254
Then he'll come.

273
00:18:21,994 --> 00:18:23,224
He'll come in no time.

274
00:18:23,224 --> 00:18:26,533
Mu Hyeok. Guard our bait until we hear from Wang Kai.

275
00:18:26,533 --> 00:18:28,263
Everyone's on standby until then.

276
00:18:28,434 --> 00:18:31,033
That's all. Good work, everyone.

277
00:18:31,134 --> 00:18:32,174
Thanks.

278
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:35,303
Let's get going.

279
00:18:39,644 --> 00:18:42,083
- Hi, honey. I'm going home. - Yes, hello.

280
00:18:42,343 --> 00:18:45,254
- I just got back. - I took Mr. Kang home.

281
00:18:45,254 --> 00:18:46,283
There's rice in the cooker,

282
00:18:46,283 --> 00:18:47,853
- food in the fridge, - I meant to call...

283
00:18:47,853 --> 00:18:49,384
- and soup in the pot. - right away.

284
00:18:49,384 --> 00:18:51,593
- It's rude to call on weekends. - Why is there no food?

285
00:18:52,853 --> 00:18:55,694
- Am I your cook? - As soon as Mr. Kang recovers,

286
00:18:55,694 --> 00:18:57,164
- Hang up! - he can work.

287
00:18:58,063 --> 00:18:59,293
Hello?

288
00:19:00,994 --> 00:19:07,273
(Auntie)

289
00:19:14,214 --> 00:19:15,214
Chan Mi.

290
00:19:15,984 --> 00:19:17,813
Your aunt said she can't reach you.

291
00:19:17,813 --> 00:19:19,513
She called the office number.

292
00:19:20,654 --> 00:19:21,654
Shoot.

293
00:19:21,654 --> 00:19:23,283
Take the call.

294
00:19:37,533 --> 00:19:39,373
You're back?

295
00:19:40,734 --> 00:19:42,373
Was it rough?

296
00:19:42,944 --> 00:19:44,644
I'm so sorry.

297
00:19:44,744 --> 00:19:47,013
I'm looking for a helper to...

298
00:19:49,444 --> 00:19:52,954
When did you last change her diaper?

299
00:19:52,954 --> 00:19:55,583
I don't know. Some time ago.

300
00:19:56,553 --> 00:19:58,023
Was it in the morning?

301
00:19:58,023 --> 00:19:59,853
Or during the day?

302
00:20:01,593 --> 00:20:05,563
So Hui, mommy will change your diaper.

303
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:07,394
Lie down.

304
00:20:08,704 --> 00:20:12,303
Did you give her a hard time because Mom wasn't around?

305
00:20:15,174 --> 00:20:17,543
You should be working in the field,

306
00:20:17,744 --> 00:20:19,974
not babysitting over the weekend.

307
00:20:20,674 --> 00:20:22,113
I'm very sorry.

308
00:20:22,113 --> 00:20:24,543
Then pull this one off.

309
00:20:24,954 --> 00:20:27,613
I spent my precious weekend babysitting for you.

310
00:20:30,353 --> 00:20:32,754
I'll feel better if you catch Michael.

311
00:20:34,394 --> 00:20:37,563
Do you think Michael even exists?

312
00:20:38,063 --> 00:20:39,363
What do you mean?

313
00:20:40,763 --> 00:20:44,164
So many people tried to catch him for years.

314
00:20:45,303 --> 00:20:46,934
No one succeeded,

315
00:20:47,734 --> 00:20:51,204
let alone set eyes on him, and that feels weird to me.

316
00:20:51,204 --> 00:20:53,343
Someone did see Michael.

317
00:20:54,043 --> 00:20:56,414
Three years ago, during the Busan operation,

318
00:20:56,414 --> 00:20:59,154
when one of our agents died, Ms. Baek...

319
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:06,694
Did someone die?

320
00:21:07,353 --> 00:21:08,694
I should go.

321
00:21:08,694 --> 00:21:11,293
The nonstop return trip from Taiwan must be draining.

322
00:21:11,793 --> 00:21:15,563
Why do I feel as if I made the round trip?

323
00:21:15,563 --> 00:21:17,164
Do you know...

324
00:21:17,164 --> 00:21:19,833
how to gain access to information that...

325
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:21,533
I'm not cleared to see?

326
00:21:21,533 --> 00:21:23,174
Get higher clearance.

327
00:21:23,174 --> 00:21:25,244
Or ask someone who has access.

328
00:21:25,573 --> 00:21:29,083
Forcing something not meant to be will only cause problems.

329
00:21:29,684 --> 00:21:30,744
Get some rest.

330
00:21:31,513 --> 00:21:33,184
You should take a taxi.

331
00:21:33,184 --> 00:21:34,984
No, thanks. See you.

332
00:21:59,674 --> 00:22:02,944
I planted these because I thought gardening would be fun.

333
00:22:03,914 --> 00:22:06,184
Look at what is causing me problems now.

334
00:22:20,434 --> 00:22:23,833
That's an insecticide and this is prickly ash extract.

335
00:22:24,803 --> 00:22:27,174
They're both great at killing insects.

336
00:22:36,714 --> 00:22:39,414
I can't use chemicals on what I will ingest.

337
00:22:39,714 --> 00:22:42,083
People prefer foods that were eaten by insects because they're organic.

338
00:22:42,553 --> 00:22:45,593
A couple of bites made by insects don't even show.

339
00:22:46,053 --> 00:22:49,093
They're just trying to survive, so we should let them eat.

340
00:22:50,863 --> 00:22:52,063
But...

341
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:56,103
it gets on my nerves when they ruin my food.

342
00:22:56,664 --> 00:22:59,434
And when that happens, it's best to just exterminate them.

343
00:23:01,603 --> 00:23:02,904
How?

344
00:23:04,303 --> 00:23:07,013
By killing them before they can even reproduce.

345
00:23:28,234 --> 00:23:29,434
You're off the project.

346
00:23:30,063 --> 00:23:31,974
I want you to leave everything behind.

347
00:23:48,954 --> 00:23:51,023
Hello, Ok Cheol speaking.

348
00:23:51,023 --> 00:23:53,353
From now on, I want you to be in charge.

349
00:23:55,224 --> 00:23:56,263
Yes, sir.

350
00:23:57,123 --> 00:23:58,494
Don't worry, sir.

351
00:23:59,394 --> 00:24:01,494
I'll make sure Chief Tak's absence doesn't show.

352
00:24:01,664 --> 00:24:04,103
I'll get the job done perfectly.

353
00:24:05,303 --> 00:24:06,373
Yes, sir!

354
00:24:29,793 --> 00:24:32,894
Chief Tak got appointed to our branch in Malaysia.

355
00:24:33,164 --> 00:24:34,863
- All of a sudden? - Yes.

356
00:24:35,303 --> 00:24:37,763
Director Myeong must have decided to discard him.

357
00:24:38,833 --> 00:24:40,174
I doubt that.

358
00:24:40,434 --> 00:24:43,103
He won't be able to abandon Chief Tak that easily.

359
00:24:43,504 --> 00:24:45,843
He's been taking care of all his dirty work...

360
00:24:45,843 --> 00:24:48,744
as his right-hand man for a long time now.

361
00:24:49,283 --> 00:24:51,513
Did you look into what I asked?

362
00:24:52,254 --> 00:24:54,783
Oh, according to the branch manager in Malaysia,

363
00:24:54,984 --> 00:24:57,023
Chief Tak came back to Korea...

364
00:24:57,023 --> 00:24:58,694
as soon as he arrived in Taipei.

365
00:25:00,654 --> 00:25:04,093
Then the trip to Taipei must have something to do...

366
00:25:04,093 --> 00:25:05,664
with why Chief Tak got sent away.

367
00:25:06,363 --> 00:25:08,704
It could mean things didn't go as planned.

368
00:25:10,533 --> 00:25:13,333
Do you think this is a good sign or a bad sign?

369
00:25:19,414 --> 00:25:20,474
Hey.

370
00:25:21,543 --> 00:25:22,644
I'm fine.

371
00:25:23,884 --> 00:25:24,944
What's this?

372
00:25:26,954 --> 00:25:28,184
I think it's a good sign.

373
00:25:29,224 --> 00:25:32,454
In China, turtles are considered good luck.

374
00:25:36,263 --> 00:25:37,523
There should be one more.

375
00:25:37,523 --> 00:25:38,734
I gave it to someone as a gift.

376
00:25:39,994 --> 00:25:42,004
- What about me? - It was one of my favorites.

377
00:25:46,934 --> 00:25:48,974
What if it turns out to be a bad sign?

378
00:25:48,974 --> 00:25:50,174
Then I should step up.

379
00:25:51,373 --> 00:25:53,373
I should stop taking care of things from behind like I'm doing now...

380
00:25:54,013 --> 00:25:55,283
and start doing things out in the open.

381
00:25:56,013 --> 00:25:57,414
Is that really necessary?

382
00:25:59,414 --> 00:26:01,013
I'm just worried...

383
00:26:01,013 --> 00:26:03,853
something bad might happen to you just like your father.

384
00:26:06,224 --> 00:26:07,293
That's why...

385
00:26:08,293 --> 00:26:09,664
I need to do this.

386
00:26:11,593 --> 00:26:12,863
I need to do it for my father.

387
00:26:34,553 --> 00:26:35,684
What are you doing?

388
00:26:37,623 --> 00:26:41,053
Well, the thing is, I'm pretty sure I'm wrong,

389
00:26:41,823 --> 00:26:45,533
but this doll somehow seems very familiar.

390
00:26:46,164 --> 00:26:47,694
By any chance...

391
00:26:52,873 --> 00:26:54,004
Never mind.

392
00:26:57,773 --> 00:26:59,573
He never gave me a doll,

393
00:26:59,613 --> 00:27:01,273
so there's no way he'd give one to a new recruit...

394
00:27:01,313 --> 00:27:03,513
who has only been here for less than a month.

395
00:27:03,543 --> 00:27:06,454
No way. It's absurd. That can never happen.

396
00:27:06,684 --> 00:27:08,184
What am I saying?

397
00:27:28,944 --> 00:27:30,043
Next time!

398
00:27:30,474 --> 00:27:32,174
Next time we meet,

399
00:27:33,214 --> 00:27:34,843
I'll give this back to you!

400
00:27:34,843 --> 00:27:37,644
I love you. I love you.

401
00:27:49,123 --> 00:27:50,164
Sir.

402
00:27:50,863 --> 00:27:54,333
I'm sorry, but I have an important appointment tonight.

403
00:27:54,434 --> 00:27:56,204
So I think I need to go now.

404
00:27:57,763 --> 00:28:00,873
Oh, okay. You can go.

405
00:28:03,303 --> 00:28:04,444
Thank you, sir.

406
00:28:04,444 --> 00:28:05,813
By the way,

407
00:28:06,813 --> 00:28:08,843
it's nothing bad, right?

408
00:28:09,113 --> 00:28:10,184
Pardon?

409
00:28:10,484 --> 00:28:12,654
You said it's something important.

410
00:28:13,313 --> 00:28:14,353
So I got a bit worried.

411
00:28:16,623 --> 00:28:18,123
It's something personal.

412
00:28:22,164 --> 00:28:23,263
You may leave.

413
00:28:29,504 --> 00:28:32,734
(Financial Statements)

414
00:28:32,734 --> 00:28:34,773
(A doppelganger? Chan Mi. Jang Mi.)

415
00:28:34,773 --> 00:28:38,674
(Is she really Baek Jang Mi?)

416
00:28:48,113 --> 00:28:50,083
Sorry for leaving without even saying goodbye.

417
00:28:50,823 --> 00:28:52,654
Good luck on your SATs.

418
00:28:53,154 --> 00:28:55,154
I hope you get accepted to the university you applied to.

419
00:30:12,273 --> 00:30:13,533
Where did she go?

420
00:30:14,573 --> 00:30:16,444
Sir, you need to pay.

421
00:30:17,474 --> 00:30:18,644
Right.

422
00:31:04,154 --> 00:31:05,323
Hello?

423
00:31:20,904 --> 00:31:21,904
(Intensive Care Unit)

424
00:33:19,388 --> 00:33:20,858
Just as I suspected,

425
00:33:20,858 --> 00:33:22,729
the multimodal method was used to strengthen the password.

426
00:33:23,229 --> 00:33:24,258
The multimodal method?

427
00:33:24,258 --> 00:33:26,399
It's a multibiometrics device,

428
00:33:26,668 --> 00:33:28,699
and its security system is the best...

429
00:33:28,769 --> 00:33:30,438
out of what's on the market.

430
00:33:30,539 --> 00:33:32,508
It'll react to Pi Cheol Woong, no doubt.

431
00:33:32,508 --> 00:33:35,208
It's been set so that the subject of the biometric lock...

432
00:33:35,339 --> 00:33:38,339
and the chip's location is constantly tracked.

433
00:33:38,539 --> 00:33:41,548
If Pi Cheol Woong is 10m away from the chip...

434
00:33:41,548 --> 00:33:43,318
for more than an hour,

435
00:33:43,449 --> 00:33:45,919
the data on the chip will be erased.

436
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:47,649
Are you saying we can't copy its content then?

437
00:33:47,649 --> 00:33:49,459
Attempting to copy it...

438
00:33:49,459 --> 00:33:51,219
will lead to the content being erased.

439
00:33:52,789 --> 00:33:54,829
So Pi Cheol Woong is nothing but...

440
00:33:55,258 --> 00:33:56,959
a disposable parcel box.

441
00:33:57,058 --> 00:33:58,628
Would they have...

442
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:01,228
killed Pi Cheol Woong once done?

443
00:34:01,368 --> 00:34:03,438
We get rid of the box after receiving the parcel, right?

444
00:34:41,738 --> 00:34:43,579
Keep an eye on it at all times.

445
00:34:45,279 --> 00:34:46,509
Would the call come in this soon?

446
00:34:46,509 --> 00:34:47,749
In about a day or two.

447
00:34:48,249 --> 00:34:49,348
That fast?

448
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:52,249
Stolen items lose their value by the second.

449
00:34:52,249 --> 00:34:53,749
Dragging it out would be their loss.

450
00:34:53,818 --> 00:34:56,719
Could Wang Kai be Michael?

451
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:57,919
We'll know who he is...

452
00:34:58,589 --> 00:34:59,958
once we arrest him.

453
00:35:03,098 --> 00:35:04,098
Right?

454
00:35:05,158 --> 00:35:06,229
Sure.

455
00:35:08,938 --> 00:35:12,139
Kang Woo Won left to attend a rice cooker launching event...

456
00:35:12,139 --> 00:35:14,139
for the company he's been a campaign model for.

457
00:35:14,408 --> 00:35:15,839
This is him urgently heading back home...

458
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:17,579
due to a sudden medical condition.

459
00:35:18,038 --> 00:35:20,879
His face can't be seen as he is being guarded by staff,

460
00:35:20,879 --> 00:35:22,748
but he obviously looks a little peaked.

461
00:35:23,218 --> 00:35:25,748
Yes, Mr. Kang returned to Korea...

462
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:29,189
earlier than scheduled to seek medical treatment.

463
00:35:29,189 --> 00:35:31,789
However, photos of him at the airport...

464
00:35:31,789 --> 00:35:33,229
spread across social media platforms...

465
00:35:33,229 --> 00:35:36,229
and a flock of fans crowded the area to get a glimpse of him.

466
00:35:38,968 --> 00:35:40,099
Gosh, look at her.

467
00:35:41,069 --> 00:35:42,998
That's just hilarious.

468
00:35:44,498 --> 00:35:45,539
Is this funny to you?

469
00:35:45,539 --> 00:35:46,838
It's priceless.

470
00:35:47,468 --> 00:35:48,909
We hope to see him in better shape...

471
00:35:48,979 --> 00:35:50,079
What is?

472
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:53,208
The look on her face, trying so hard...

473
00:35:53,208 --> 00:35:54,479
to get out of that crowd is just so...

474
00:35:54,479 --> 00:35:55,748
("Who Was the Woman Protecting Kang Woo Won?")

475
00:35:55,748 --> 00:35:57,178
Her features are all scrunched up.

476
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:02,458
Unbelievable. Talk about the most embarrassing photo ever.

477
00:36:03,058 --> 00:36:05,458
You're right. It's hilarious.

478
00:36:07,259 --> 00:36:08,629
Gosh.

479
00:36:08,789 --> 00:36:12,199
My eyes water easily these days.

480
00:36:12,259 --> 00:36:13,798
She threw herself at her job...

481
00:36:13,798 --> 00:36:16,539
which was to protect my image and you find that funny.

482
00:36:16,539 --> 00:36:17,898
Of course not.

483
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:21,109
I'm deeply touched.

484
00:36:21,468 --> 00:36:24,579
Gosh, my eyes.

485
00:36:25,609 --> 00:36:28,648
I'm so touched that I'm crying.

486
00:36:28,909 --> 00:36:31,518
Don't laugh in front of me again. It sickens me.

487
00:36:32,518 --> 00:36:34,319
What else can I do then?

488
00:36:34,689 --> 00:36:35,759
How about this?

489
00:36:37,789 --> 00:36:39,629
I'm neither laughing nor crying.

490
00:36:41,958 --> 00:36:43,898
Don't make any expressions at all!

491
00:36:46,298 --> 00:36:48,199
You and Cheol Woong are both annoying.

492
00:36:49,099 --> 00:36:52,169
I have one of those naturally smiling faces.

493
00:36:52,738 --> 00:36:56,238
Even when I'm sad, my eyes look like they're laughing.

494
00:36:57,208 --> 00:36:58,539
Woo Won, come on.

495
00:37:00,148 --> 00:37:02,849
(Chinatown)

496
00:37:22,939 --> 00:37:24,039
Are things all right?

497
00:37:24,498 --> 00:37:25,708
Things couldn't be better.

498
00:37:26,939 --> 00:37:30,009
I was wondering if the NIS was onto us.

499
00:37:32,338 --> 00:37:33,348
The NIS?

500
00:37:37,749 --> 00:37:39,218
I'm sure they're suspicious,

501
00:37:39,819 --> 00:37:41,148
but all they have on us is circumstantial.

502
00:37:41,389 --> 00:37:44,088
If the deal goes south...

503
00:37:44,088 --> 00:37:45,189
It won't matter.

504
00:37:45,518 --> 00:37:46,629
And Wang Kai?

505
00:37:46,929 --> 00:37:48,458
He has arrived at the airport.

506
00:37:48,458 --> 00:37:49,598
Already?

507
00:37:50,898 --> 00:37:52,329
Let's see then.

508
00:37:58,768 --> 00:38:01,809
My gosh. These look beautiful.

509
00:38:06,978 --> 00:38:08,179
This is our chance...

510
00:38:08,679 --> 00:38:10,648
to get rid of the NIS...

511
00:38:10,648 --> 00:38:13,049
that has been making life difficult for us.

512
00:38:13,348 --> 00:38:14,718
But we're not in Taiwan.

513
00:38:15,088 --> 00:38:17,458
Is it still possible in Korea too?

514
00:38:17,559 --> 00:38:19,489
It's better that we're in Korea.

515
00:38:19,489 --> 00:38:22,958
Korean law actually favors criminals.

516
00:38:31,038 --> 00:38:32,069
This time,

517
00:38:33,838 --> 00:38:35,369
I'll be making the deal myself.

518
00:38:35,569 --> 00:38:37,009
It could be dangerous.

519
00:38:37,009 --> 00:38:38,309
If things go south and we die,

520
00:38:38,908 --> 00:38:40,509
then I'll be happy not to have died alone.

521
00:38:40,778 --> 00:38:42,879
Let me secure the package for now.

522
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:44,848
I need to deliver in spades this time.

523
00:38:45,619 --> 00:38:46,889
Only then,

524
00:38:47,218 --> 00:38:49,718
Director Myeong won't ever want to have Chief Tak back.

525
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:51,858
Darn it.

526
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:54,489
If only he had died there.

527
00:39:07,768 --> 00:39:09,338
Make the call.

528
00:39:15,918 --> 00:39:17,579
What the...

529
00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:21,348
Wang Kai?

530
00:39:22,518 --> 00:39:24,858
What do I do? Darn it.

531
00:39:25,458 --> 00:39:26,559
My gosh.

532
00:39:27,228 --> 00:39:28,429
Mr. Dong!

533
00:39:29,088 --> 00:39:31,228
Incoming call. It's from Wang Kai.

534
00:39:34,829 --> 00:39:36,768
You make me come all the way to Korea?

535
00:39:37,168 --> 00:39:38,869
The product had better be intact.

536
00:39:39,408 --> 00:39:42,879
Of course. The file hasn't been corrupted.

537
00:39:44,838 --> 00:39:47,108
I thought we could rendezvous at Incheon Port.

538
00:39:47,179 --> 00:39:50,218
It is I who decides the location. Tonight at 10pm.

539
00:39:51,778 --> 00:39:55,418
Meet me at Unit 11-3 of the Paju Distribution Center.

540
00:39:59,489 --> 00:40:02,598
Tonight, 10pm, Paju Distribution Center.

541
00:40:04,158 --> 00:40:06,598
I don't like how he's making his move this fast.

542
00:40:07,929 --> 00:40:10,898
When have we ever operated under safe conditions?

543
00:40:13,309 --> 00:40:15,338
We'll head out soon, so call everyone in.

544
00:40:15,408 --> 00:40:17,179
You're going to notify Chief Seo first, right?

545
00:40:18,338 --> 00:40:21,309
This seems like an operation that requires backup.

546
00:40:26,489 --> 00:40:27,588
Backup?

547
00:40:27,989 --> 00:40:30,119
You crawled back into Korea without reporting to me first...

548
00:40:30,418 --> 00:40:32,288
and now you barge in here with a request.

549
00:40:32,728 --> 00:40:33,829
Backup?

550
00:40:34,728 --> 00:40:35,858
Please authorize it.

551
00:40:35,929 --> 00:40:38,059
You think you landed this case because you're hotshots?

552
00:40:39,098 --> 00:40:41,898
Look at you running around as if you own the place.

553
00:40:42,028 --> 00:40:43,468
I'll wrap this up for sure this time.

554
00:40:44,369 --> 00:40:45,398
What if you don't?

555
00:40:46,968 --> 00:40:48,038
Will you resign?

556
00:40:49,939 --> 00:40:51,079
You got cocky with me...

557
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:53,049
without willing to put everything on the line?

558
00:40:53,778 --> 00:40:54,978
We're running out of time, sir.

559
00:40:54,978 --> 00:40:56,278
Let me say this again.

560
00:40:57,179 --> 00:40:58,249
You'll be held accountable...

561
00:40:59,489 --> 00:41:00,989
for this operation.

562
00:41:11,699 --> 00:41:12,799
(Wash and Clean)

563
00:41:18,838 --> 00:41:21,069
As you all know, Pi Cheol Woong will make the deal...

564
00:41:21,069 --> 00:41:23,009
with Wang Kai.

565
00:41:23,478 --> 00:41:25,949
He's a new player that hasn't been flagged by us.

566
00:41:26,809 --> 00:41:28,809
There's no manual regarding how to handle him...

567
00:41:29,478 --> 00:41:32,049
and his threat level is unknown.

568
00:41:33,189 --> 00:41:35,088
The deal goes down at Paju Distribution Center.

569
00:41:35,088 --> 00:41:37,619
Pi Cheol Woong will head inside with the watch on him.

570
00:41:37,619 --> 00:41:39,489
Chan Mi and Mi Soon, lead Alpha Team...

571
00:41:39,489 --> 00:41:41,059
and secretly follow Pi Cheol Woong.

572
00:41:41,059 --> 00:41:43,759
The rest will wait outside the building...

573
00:41:44,098 --> 00:41:45,458
and raid the facility...

574
00:41:45,458 --> 00:41:47,929
when Alpha Team gives the signal.

575
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:04,779
We're here.

576
00:42:04,779 --> 00:42:05,819
All right.

577
00:42:07,718 --> 00:42:09,289
I'll go too.

578
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:11,159
You should wait here for this one.

579
00:42:11,988 --> 00:42:13,559
Let me join them.

580
00:42:13,789 --> 00:42:16,529
I know I lack in many ways, but I want to help.

581
00:42:16,529 --> 00:42:18,258
This operation is just too dangerous.

582
00:42:19,929 --> 00:42:20,998
Mi Soon, you coming?

583
00:42:21,498 --> 00:42:22,968
I don't care.

584
00:42:23,669 --> 00:42:25,868
This is our job, isn't it?

585
00:42:25,868 --> 00:42:29,779
No one recognizes our service, but it still must be done.

586
00:42:30,878 --> 00:42:32,338
I can do it too, you know.

587
00:42:37,449 --> 00:42:39,718
I can do it and I will.

588
00:42:42,718 --> 00:42:44,618
No, it's too dangerous.

589
00:42:45,159 --> 00:42:46,159
We'll go with Plan B.

590
00:42:46,529 --> 00:42:48,758
But it's our job to do dangerous tasks.

591
00:42:48,929 --> 00:42:51,559
No one recognizes our service, but it still must be done.

592
00:42:51,829 --> 00:42:54,329
You said you have something special planned tonight.

593
00:42:54,769 --> 00:42:56,399
That's all the more reason to do it.

594
00:42:56,498 --> 00:42:57,699
I don't want to be embarrassed of myself.

595
00:43:02,838 --> 00:43:03,909
Unbelievable.

596
00:43:04,708 --> 00:43:07,179
Is this what I get for looking out for you?

597
00:43:14,248 --> 00:43:17,659
Ms. Baek, there's something I need to tell you after today's job.

598
00:43:17,659 --> 00:43:19,059
Are you finally resigning?

599
00:43:19,059 --> 00:43:20,059
If I do,

600
00:43:20,059 --> 00:43:22,728
it'll be like losing a right arm for you.

601
00:43:23,429 --> 00:43:24,829
Who says you're my right-hand man?

602
00:43:24,929 --> 00:43:26,899
Say I'm your left then.

603
00:43:32,638 --> 00:43:34,708
This is our job, isn't it?

604
00:43:34,868 --> 00:43:38,708
No one recognizes our service, but it still must be done.

605
00:43:39,108 --> 00:43:40,649
I can do it too, you know.

606
00:43:46,118 --> 00:43:48,388
I practiced everything you taught me...

607
00:43:48,388 --> 00:43:50,189
during our training sessions...

608
00:43:50,289 --> 00:43:52,588
and I went to the firing range...

609
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:53,728
whenever I had free time.

610
00:43:54,388 --> 00:43:57,998
Just like you told me to, I can take care of myself now.

611
00:44:12,409 --> 00:44:13,478
Here.

612
00:44:14,809 --> 00:44:16,008
Just in case.

613
00:44:17,149 --> 00:44:18,419
Thanks, Mr. Dong.

614
00:44:29,628 --> 00:44:31,059
Let me carry that.

615
00:44:35,829 --> 00:44:36,968
Don't take it personally.

616
00:44:36,968 --> 00:44:39,738
Chan Mi's always on edge before a big operation.

617
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:42,638
The more dangerous the operation, the more stressed out she is.

618
00:44:43,508 --> 00:44:46,409
Blame her old age if you must.

619
00:44:46,978 --> 00:44:48,508
How sad.

620
00:45:06,769 --> 00:45:09,228
We've come this far, so let's wrap this up neatly.

621
00:45:11,468 --> 00:45:14,309
I guess I have nothing to lose anymore.

622
00:45:14,309 --> 00:45:16,138
Your confession has already been recorded,

623
00:45:16,138 --> 00:45:17,779
so you can't escape punishment.

624
00:45:18,008 --> 00:45:19,338
It wasn't recorded illegally,

625
00:45:19,338 --> 00:45:21,309
so it's 100 percent admissible in court.

626
00:45:22,848 --> 00:45:24,279
I'm saying there's no point in running.

627
00:45:24,649 --> 00:45:27,118
Isn't it better to stand trial in Korea...

628
00:45:27,789 --> 00:45:30,919
compared to being dragged off to China?

629
00:45:31,289 --> 00:45:32,319
Still,

630
00:45:32,819 --> 00:45:35,488
would they care that you're the NIS though?

631
00:45:35,988 --> 00:45:37,728
These guys are vicious.

632
00:45:38,299 --> 00:45:40,098
We're not trying to scare them off.

633
00:45:40,998 --> 00:45:43,738
Scumbags who deal in unlawful activities for a price...

634
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:45,699
should be wiped off this world.

635
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:47,968
That's how we maintain a basic sense of peace.

636
00:46:01,218 --> 00:46:02,289
Be careful in there.

637
00:46:07,559 --> 00:46:10,128
We're ready on our end. Move out.

638
00:46:47,968 --> 00:46:49,669
Our people's safety is the number one priority.

639
00:46:50,138 --> 00:46:52,468
No one shoots until you're given a green light.

640
00:46:52,738 --> 00:46:54,008
I'll say that once again.

641
00:46:54,309 --> 00:46:56,878
No one shoots until you're given an order.

642
00:47:58,968 --> 00:48:00,008
The package?

643
00:48:00,708 --> 00:48:01,968
It's on my wrist.

644
00:48:04,539 --> 00:48:05,909
We have visual on the package.

645
00:48:07,579 --> 00:48:10,218
Transaction is complete. Get eyes on them.

646
00:48:24,029 --> 00:48:25,098
Chan Mi?

647
00:48:34,039 --> 00:48:35,409
- Freeze! - Stop right there.

648
00:48:45,519 --> 00:48:47,218
I'll handle five.

649
00:48:47,689 --> 00:48:48,949
You take the rest.

650
00:48:49,549 --> 00:48:50,618
Five?

651
00:48:51,218 --> 00:48:53,689
The rest? That's more for me to handle.

652
00:49:01,598 --> 00:49:03,638
Don't come any closer.

653
00:49:03,638 --> 00:49:07,039
Please don't let me die.

654
00:49:09,338 --> 00:49:10,439
No one is to enter.

655
00:49:11,008 --> 00:49:12,008
What's going on?

656
00:49:23,988 --> 00:49:26,789
Should anybody take a single step...

657
00:49:27,929 --> 00:49:28,929
You know what'll happen.

658
00:49:35,728 --> 00:49:36,868
There's a bomb.

659
00:49:39,299 --> 00:49:41,238
Contact EOD immediately.

660
00:49:41,468 --> 00:49:42,968
EOD?

661
00:49:44,138 --> 00:49:45,208
The bomb squad?

662
00:49:46,409 --> 00:49:48,508
You've got to be kidding me!

663
00:49:56,988 --> 00:49:59,419
Please save me.

664
00:50:02,689 --> 00:50:04,958
Drop your weapons. All of you.

665
00:50:49,739 --> 00:50:51,408
Why did you bring two guns?

666
00:50:51,908 --> 00:50:54,209
I took Team Leader Dong's, just in case.

667
00:51:17,469 --> 00:51:18,598
You hear me, right?

668
00:51:20,009 --> 00:51:22,969
If I see anyone following us, the bomb will go off.

669
00:51:23,479 --> 00:51:25,878
If anyone tries to come into the building,

670
00:51:26,678 --> 00:51:27,709
the bomb will go off.

671
00:51:41,358 --> 00:51:42,459
Hold your fire.

672
00:51:44,398 --> 00:51:45,529
Let them pass.

673
00:51:59,378 --> 00:52:01,209
Have the license plates tracked.

674
00:52:03,918 --> 00:52:04,979
I need these vehicles tracked.

675
00:52:05,848 --> 00:52:07,188
Hurry. It's urgent.

676
00:52:13,759 --> 00:52:15,559
- Do you have them? - Right here.

677
00:52:19,259 --> 00:52:21,069
- Why don't we have anything? - The license plates must be fake.

678
00:52:21,069 --> 00:52:22,428
There's no information on them.

679
00:52:34,509 --> 00:52:35,549
Oh, wait.

680
00:52:36,749 --> 00:52:39,378
I forgot to mention that it'll go off anyway...

681
00:52:39,848 --> 00:52:41,118
in an hour.

682
00:52:49,029 --> 00:52:50,098
In other words,

683
00:52:50,799 --> 00:52:52,898
you don't intend to blow it up right now.

684
00:53:01,069 --> 00:53:02,469
Defuse the bomb.

685
00:53:08,648 --> 00:53:10,549
You can't leave without me.

686
00:53:10,549 --> 00:53:12,948
Any movement will trigger the bomb, so sit still.

687
00:53:13,118 --> 00:53:14,219
Hold your breath.

688
00:53:14,289 --> 00:53:15,489
Can you defuse it?

689
00:53:15,588 --> 00:53:18,719
I only dealt with small bombs during EOD training.

690
00:53:19,559 --> 00:53:20,729
One of this size...

691
00:53:31,668 --> 00:53:33,338
I need instructions.

692
00:53:35,138 --> 00:53:37,039
The best way is to cut off the power.

693
00:53:37,279 --> 00:53:39,938
It could be risky though. Cutting the wrong wire can...

694
00:53:40,948 --> 00:53:42,249
Why would you mention that right now?

695
00:53:42,848 --> 00:53:43,918
Got it.

696
00:53:44,948 --> 00:53:46,648
Let's disable the control system first.

697
00:53:59,158 --> 00:54:01,128
You don't care if you die?

698
00:54:01,128 --> 00:54:04,039
I will anyway when the bomb goes off, right?

699
00:54:05,969 --> 00:54:07,239
The control system...

700
00:54:09,569 --> 00:54:11,039
It's normally the red wire.

701
00:54:17,579 --> 00:54:19,549
What are you waiting for? He said it's the red wire.

702
00:54:19,579 --> 00:54:20,648
Hold on.

703
00:54:21,219 --> 00:54:22,848
I doubt...

704
00:54:22,848 --> 00:54:26,219
the bomb-maker connected it in such a complicated way.

705
00:54:49,108 --> 00:54:50,319
Wait!

706
00:54:50,749 --> 00:54:51,878
Not the red wire?

707
00:54:52,479 --> 00:54:55,049
What on earth are you doing?

708
00:54:55,148 --> 00:54:56,249
Are you colorblind?

709
00:54:56,249 --> 00:54:58,588
She said it's the red wire. Red.

710
00:54:58,688 --> 00:55:02,029
R, E, D. Red!

711
00:55:24,418 --> 00:55:25,719
Just hold on.

712
00:55:26,219 --> 00:55:27,719
Think this through.

713
00:55:27,719 --> 00:55:28,888
Are you sure about this?

714
00:55:29,489 --> 00:55:30,989
Think it through once more.

715
00:55:31,759 --> 00:55:32,789
Ye Eun...

716
00:56:07,588 --> 00:56:10,198
It's all right. It can happen to anyone.

717
00:56:12,299 --> 00:56:13,799
Be careful of the control system...

718
00:56:14,168 --> 00:56:17,138
and disconnect the power by cutting the third wire...

719
00:56:17,398 --> 00:56:18,499
from the left.

720
00:56:45,858 --> 00:56:47,198
Hurry up, will you?

721
00:56:47,598 --> 00:56:50,098
You only have an hour until the files are erased.

722
00:56:50,539 --> 00:56:51,799
What is he yapping on about?

723
00:56:52,668 --> 00:56:53,769
Who is that punk?

724
00:56:57,838 --> 00:56:58,908
I'm sorry.

725
00:56:59,579 --> 00:57:00,608
I apologize.

726
00:57:28,438 --> 00:57:29,608
Step back.

727
00:58:27,529 --> 00:58:28,569
It's you, isn't it?

728
00:58:28,999 --> 00:58:30,229
You're Michael.

729
00:58:37,579 --> 00:58:41,079
Did you really believe that you were in the clear?

730
00:58:47,648 --> 00:58:50,049
What? Why is it ticking again?

731
00:58:50,118 --> 00:58:53,319
There must be another bomb.

732
00:58:53,559 --> 00:58:54,588
What?

733
00:59:02,069 --> 00:59:04,138
This is insane.

734
00:59:04,668 --> 00:59:05,799
What now?

735
00:59:05,799 --> 00:59:07,938
Get out of there. Run!

736
00:59:23,188 --> 00:59:24,358
Get down!

737
00:59:49,178 --> 00:59:51,049
(Epilogue)

738
00:59:54,918 --> 01:00:00,059
(15 years ago)

739
01:00:01,029 --> 01:00:02,229
Ms. Baek,

740
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:04,858
do you know why first loves never have happy endings?

741
01:00:06,299 --> 01:00:09,868
It's because we don't know how much we should love the other.

742
01:00:10,469 --> 01:00:13,539
But how can we measure one's love...

743
01:00:13,638 --> 01:00:15,569
for another person though...

744
01:00:15,569 --> 01:00:16,938
when it's not visible?

745
01:00:18,338 --> 01:00:19,908
A love that can be measured...

746
01:00:20,479 --> 01:00:22,549
is not love in the purest sense anymore.

747
01:00:23,049 --> 01:00:26,418
Even though you don't love me at all,

748
01:00:26,678 --> 01:00:28,249
I can love you 100.

749
01:00:28,918 --> 01:00:32,888
No, wait. Is it 1,000? Not even that seems to be enough.

750
01:00:33,688 --> 01:00:36,289
Let's make it 3,000. I love you 3,000.

751
01:00:38,799 --> 01:00:40,029
Yes, 3,000.

752
01:00:57,448 --> 01:00:59,519
My gosh.

753
01:01:41,989 --> 01:01:46,759
