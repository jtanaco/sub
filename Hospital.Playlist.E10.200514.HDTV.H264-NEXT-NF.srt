<i><b>Ik-jun?</i></b>

2
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:32,270
<b>He went all the way to Inje?</b>

3
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,020
<i><b>Yes, he just left.</i></b>

4
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:36,900
<b>-<i>He even gave me money.</i>
-What's gotten into him?</b>

5
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:38,110
<b>That's so unlike him.</b>

6
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:40,200
<i><b>I almost burst into tears.</i></b>

7
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,530
<i><b>We never say things like
"thanks" or "sorry"</i></b>

8
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,030
<i><b>to each other.</i></b>

9
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,790
<b>I know that, of course.
My family is the same way.</b>

10
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:51,500
<b>Oh, boy. I guess he's getting old too.</b>

11
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,790
<b>-<i>By the way, have you left yet?</i>
-Yes, just now.</b>

12
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,050
<b>I'll call you when I get to the rest stop.
See you soon.</b>

13
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,440
<b>Everything looks good.
What should we order?</b>

14
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,650
<b>What are you doing?</b>

15
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,320
<b>There's a strand of hair on your jacket.</b>

16
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:25,780
<b>Do you have to keep
taking your medication?</b>

17
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:29,160
<b>Yes, it's a pain reliever.
Just one tablet a day.</b>

18
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:31,540
<b>You're one tough cookie.</b>

19
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,040
<b>You've been holding out like this
for years?</b>

20
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:35,460
<b>But I'm okay now.</b>

21
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,420
<b>Like Ik-sun, I have to refrain
from strenuous exercise,</b>

22
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,010
<b>but daily activities are fine.</b>

23
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:43,220
<b>The medication is for my chronic pain.</b>

24
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,930
<b>The pain isn't too bad though.</b>

25
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:47,180
<b>Hold out for just another year.</b>

26
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,470
<b>You've been working hard
to build experience.</b>

27
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,350
<b>You should wrap it up well
and pass your board exam.</b>

28
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:54,520
<b>Yes.</b>

29
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,940
<b>I'll stay right by your side, Professor.</b>

30
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:00,740
<b>What do you recommend?</b>

31
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,530
<b>Meat lovers like
our creamy pasta with tenderloin.</b>

32
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:06,120
<b>Those who like oil pasta
usually order the pollack roe pasta.</b>

33
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,280
<b>Why must he be so punctual?</b>

34
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,540
<b>Over here.</b>

35
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,880
<b>Professor, you've slowed down
your eating pace.</b>

36
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,250
<b>At your old pace,
you'd be eating your dessert now.</b>

37
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,420
<b>No, I eat even faster now.</b>

38
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:24,840
<b>I'm trying very hard to pace myself.</b>

39
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,970
<b>The food here is good.
And it's nice to eat out for a change.</b>

40
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,560
<b>Seok-min, isn't it time for you to
to start studying? The exam is coming up.</b>

41
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,230
<b>Yes, I'm going to start from next week.</b>

42
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,770
<b>Professor, what will you do without me?
You'll be so bored.</b>

43
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:40,320
<b>-I'll visit you often.
-Where is the study room?</b>

44
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,820
<b>-Can we visit you?
-Hey, it's called a study room.</b>

45
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,820
<b>Why would you visit someone
who has to study?</b>

46
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,030
<b>I'll visit you guys. Goodness.</b>

47
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:50,830
<b>My dear Seon-bin. When I'm gone,
you won't have anyone to mess with you.</b>

48
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,290
<b>You'll be so bored.</b>

49
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:53,660
<b>"My dear Seon-bin"?</b>

50
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,250
<b>Did you just call her "my dear Seon-bin"?</b>

51
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:58,880
<b>My dear Ahn Chi-hong.</b>

52
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,050
<b>My dear Heo Seon-bin
and my dear Professor Chae.</b>

53
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:04,220
<b>What else... Yes, my dear pasta.</b>

54
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:08,340
<b>Your strong denial seems suspicious.
Are you sure there is nothing?</b>

55
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,260
<b>What are you talking about?
Nothing's going on.</b>

56
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:11,890
<b>Professor, shall we order desserts?</b>

57
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:14,310
<b>My gosh, look at her
trying to change the topic.</b>

58
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:17,770
<b>Seriously, nothing's going on.
What do you take me for?</b>

59
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,560
<b>Hey, what's wrong with me?</b>

60
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,900
<b>My dear Dr. Yong, you're such a catch.</b>

61
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,530
<b>How dare I even dream of dating you?</b>

62
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:25,690
<b>My dear Dr. Yong.</b>

63
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:29,410
<b>They say that sneezing and love
can't be hidden.</b>

64
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:30,570
<b>You obviously can't hide it.</b>

65
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,030
<b>Something must be going on.</b>

66
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:35,960
<b>Guys, what's wrong with dating?</b>

67
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:39,460
<b>Professor, are we not allowed
to date our co-workers?</b>

68
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,960
<b>Why not? I'm all for it.</b>

69
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,800
<b>It's nice if you can rely on each other.</b>

70
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,840
<b>Right.</b>

71
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:49,390
<b>Seon-bin and I are seeing each other.</b>

72
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,140
<b>Hey, Seon-bin. We're dating, right?</b>

73
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,100
<b>We got busted.</b>

74
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:56,680
<b>As if anyone would buy that.</b>

75
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,230
<b>Who would believe that?</b>

76
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:05,440
<b>Dr. Yong, what are we supposed to do
in this situation?</b>

77
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:08,200
<b>What do you think?
Let's just order some desserts.</b>

78
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,280
<b>Excuse me!</b>

79
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,000
<b>What is this social club called again?
"I Am a <i>Gosu</i>" like master?</b>

80
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,460
<i><b>That's right. I Am a</i> Gosu.</b>

81
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,670
<i><b>I see them at least once a month,</i></b>

82
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,930
<i><b>but I can't hold out anymore.</i></b>

83
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,010
<i><b>They said I must bring you today.
They really want to meet you.</i></b>

84
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,140
<i><b>We'll just stop by
and have dinner with them, okay?</i></b>

85
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,060
<b>Don't do this to me, Ik-sun.</b>

86
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:41,150
<b>I guess you really want to see
the end of me.</b>

87
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:45,690
<i><b>No. They're all nice people.
They're so naive and innocent.</i></b>

88
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:48,610
<b>But I'm sure they're all
fourth or fifth-degree holders.</b>

89
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,450
<b>Ik-sun. Even for taekwondo,
I'm only an orange belt in rank.</b>

<b>Okay. We'll go together.</b>

92
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,960
<b>I have to go

<b>What is this?</b>

94
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:10,550
<b>Is this another thing you don't eat?</b>

95

<b>The pleasure is mine.
Thank you for inviting me.</b>

99

<b>This is Captain Hong, the troublemaker.</b>

100

<b>I totally turned over a new leaf
after that day.</b>

101

<b>That night,
Major Lee kicked me in the shin nonstop--</b>

<b>-Well--
-Hey!</b>

00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,640
<b>Does he help other hospitals too?</b>

152
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,140
<b>Yes, I reached out to him
for help recently.</b>

153
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,390
<b>He must have a surplus cash flow now.
He sent money right away.</b>

154
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:52,020
<b>I just sent you the number.</b>

155
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:54,480
<b>Hyeon Jeong-mi in Social Services
at Kangwoon Medical Center.</b>

156
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:57,650
<b>Only she can reach him. She'll put you
in touch with Daddy-Long-Legs.</b>

157
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:59,700
<b>-Is it an emergency?
-No.</b>

158
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,160
<b>It's for a long-term patient.</b>

159
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:03,780
<b>He's stuck here
because he can't pay the bills.</b>

160
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,910
<b>I think he's trying
to take out high-interest loans.</b>

161
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:07,870
<b>He's an old man with no family or friends.</b>

162
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,830
<b>But he owns the bachelor apartment
where he lives,</b>

163
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:13,380
<b>so he doesn't meet Social Services'
criteria. It's complicated.</b>

164
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,750
<b>First, I want to contact them
and see if it's feasible.</b>

165
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,880
<b>-Did you have lunch?
-I have surgery. I have to go.</b>

166
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,800
<b>Take it easy.</b>

167
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,890
<b>That's right.
The patient is a 78-year-old male.</b>

168
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:26,720
<b>He underwent a right hemihepatectomy</b>

169
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:28,390
<b>due to HCC.</b>

170
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:31,190
<b>He's been here for a while
because his liver hasn't recovered.</b>

171
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:35,110
<i><b>Okay. I'll summarize it
and send it to Daddy-Long-Legs.</i></b>

172
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,570
<i><b>He usually texts back right away.</i></b>

173
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,400
<b>-<i>Give me about half an hour.</i>
-Okay, thank you.</b>

174
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:44,660
<b>Wait, is he a doctor?</b>

175
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,120
<b>He's asking detailed questions
about the patient.</b>

176
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,700
<i><b>That I don't know.</i></b>

177
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:51,540
<i><b>I think he's well versed
in medical knowledge.</i></b>

178
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:55,710
<i><b>He always asks detailed questions about
the patient's situation and condition.</i></b>

179
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,790
<i><b>Anyway, I'll call you right back.</i></b>

180
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,170
<b>Thank you.</b>

181

<b>29TH
DEPARTURE</b>

182
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,260
<b>Hi, Mom.</b>

183
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:47,840
<b>What's my sweet, adorable baby doing?</b>

184
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:50,140
<b>-<i>I'm going to have lunch with Song-hwa.</i>
-Song-hwa?</b>

185
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,480
<b>Good. That's great. Shall I join you guys?</b>

186
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,440
<b>We're just ordering in.</b>

187
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:00,070
<b>And it's not Song-hwa.
You got it all wrong.</b>

188
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:03,490
<b>"It's not Song-hwa"?
That means you are seeing someone.</b>

189
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:06,200
<b>Who is it? Marry her. Get married at once.</b>

190
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,070
<b>My first pick is Song-hwa,
but I'm fine with whomever you choose.</b>

191
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,120
<b>Gosh, my bad. I'm not seeing anyone.</b>

192
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,830
<b>It was a slip of the tongue.</b>

193
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:15,540
<b>Mom, I'll be in Yangpyeong this weekend.
Make me some noodles.</b>

194
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,540
<b>Jong-su and I are going to see
the fall foliage this weekend.</b>

195
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:19,960
<b>Come next weekend.</b>

196
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:23,550
<b>But I don't want to see you if you are
going to talk about that. Don't come.</b>

197
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:27,340
<b>Let's talk in person.</b>

198
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,050
<b>Enjoy your lunch with Mr. Ju.</b>

199
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:31,850
<b>All right.</b>

200
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:46,610
<b>-Did you call everyone?
-Seok-hyeong has patients.</b>

201
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,320
<b>Jun-wan has surgery,
and Jeong-won needs a minute.</b>

202
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:51,490
<b>Hey, I heard Seok-hyeong is
very popular among moms-to-be.</b>

203
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,740
<b>Gosh, cut the nonsense.</b>

204
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,040
<b>He's like that with just us.</b>

205
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,630
<b>My friend's sister-in-law is his patient,</b>

206
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:01,710
<b>and she said
he's the sweetest guy on earth.</b>

207
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,710
<b>Gosh, I find that very hard to believe.</b>

208
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:08,800
<b>Jeez! I get so anxious when you do that.</b>

209
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,720
<b>Why you... I wish I could just punch you.</b>

210
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,140
<b>Just use this.</b>

211
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,640
<b>You're so all over the place.
Who do you take after?</b>

212
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:19,520
<b>I take after U-ju. It's all from him.</b>

213
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:23,230
<b>All right. Gosh, that hurt.</b>

214
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:26,320
<b>There.</b>

215
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:31,370
<b>-Wait.
-What? What is it?</b>

216
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,700
<b>Three, two, one.</b>

217
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:34,930
<b>Open.</b>

218
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,570
<b>-Wait.
-What? What is it?</b>

219
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,900
<b>Three, two, one.</b>

220
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:41,360
<b>Open.</b>

221
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:43,950
<b>The food is already here?</b>

222
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,280
<b>You guys ordered a lot.</b>

223
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:49,700
<b>You came in exactly one minute.
You give me the heebie-jeebies.</b>

224
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,120
<b>You're more impressive.
Are you the Bionic Woman?</b>

225
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:55,290
<b>-What about the other guys?
-Seok-hyeong has patients.</b>

226
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,460
<b>Jun-wan has surgery,
and you took a minute.</b>

227
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:04,050
<b>Hello.</b>

228
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,970
<b>It's been a month, right?
Please have a seat.</b>

229
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:10,140
<b>-Hello, Doctor.
-Hello.</b>

230
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,350
<b>The blood stagnation is gone.</b>

231
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,320
<b>You had a complete ultrasound
this morning, right?</b>

232
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,150
<b>Yes.</b>

233
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:24,400
<b>The normal cervical length is 3cm
on average.</b>

234
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:29,410
<b>For where you're at, anything
under 2.5cm is considered too short.</b>

235
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:34,080
<b>But yours is under 1cm,
which is very short.</b>

236
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,670
<b>And I can see</b>

237
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:39,250
<b>that your cervix is slightly open.</b>

238
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,460
<b>In cases like this,</b>

239
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:45,720
<b>it's highly likely
that the baby will be born prematurely.</b>

240
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,760
<b>Then what do I do?</b>

241
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:52,270
<b>Don't worry. You're okay.</b>

242
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:54,770
<b>Yes, he's right.</b>

243
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:57,480
<b>Thankfully, you can undergo surgery now.</b>

244
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,980
<b>Don't worry too much.</b>

245
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,900
<b>Cervical cerclage...</b>

246
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,240
<b>It's commonly called
the McDonald cerclage.</b>

247
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,910
<b>It's a procedure where
we tie the cervical opening</b>

248
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:08,870
<b>so that the cervix won't open.</b>

249
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,830
<b>Let's get you checked in
for surgery right away.</b>

250
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:14,710
<b>The entire procedure
will take about 30 minutes.</b>

251
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:18,670
<b>If there's no infection inside the uterus
after the surgery,</b>

252
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,750
<b>you'll be discharged in about two days.</b>

253
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:24,920
<b>The nurse here
will walk you through the steps.</b>

254
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:32,970
<b>I see this from time to time.</b>

255
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:37,890
<b>You're not the only one,
so don't worry too much.</b>

256
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:42,650
<b>Doctor, please don't tell me
that I might have another miscarriage.</b>

257
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,110
<b>What should we do, honey?</b>

258
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:49,110
<b>-Stop it with the nonsense.
-Yes, don't say that.</b>

259
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,990
<b>I'll do my very best.</b>

260
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,210
<b>We must protect the baby</b>

261
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,540
<b>this time no matter what.</b>

262
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:05,090
<b>Let's go ahead with the surgery today</b>

263
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:08,220
<b>and make sure you get
enough rest at home for a while.</b>

264
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:12,390
<b>As for your next appointment, I'll see you
a week after you get discharged.</b>

265
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:13,970
<b>I'll have to check and see</b>

266
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,730
<b>if your cervical length
is being maintained.</b>

267
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,270
<b>My gosh.</b>

268
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,230
<b>Don't worry.</b>

269
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,320
<b>Try to think positive, happy thoughts.</b>

270
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:26,900
<b>It'll help the baby.</b>

271
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:29,990
<b>Okay.</b>

272
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,750
<b>Professor Cheon's engagement
got called off.</b>

273
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:39,080
<b>Yes.</b>

274
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:43,000
<b>Mr. Ju told me. The daughter was
totally against her mom marrying him.</b>

275
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:45,380
<b>Her daughter is her savior.</b>

276
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,420
<b>Hey.</b>

277
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:52,180
<b>Please.</b>

278
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:55,100
<b>Okay, I'll slow down.</b>

279
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:57,890
<b>I eat fast because I have three brothers.</b>

280
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:02,850
<b>He was diagnosed with DCMP
and is waiting for a heart transplant.</b>

281
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,020
<b>I know that.</b>

282
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:07,280
<b>He's been here for over two months.
Cut the wordy explanation.</b>

283
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,150
<b>What was his IO yesterday?</b>

284
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,490
<b>The urine output was 600 yesterday.</b>

285
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:13,870
<b>-Potassium?
-Six.</b>

286
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:16,910
<b>Then give him Lasix.
Keep checking and give him RI if needed.</b>

287
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:18,830
<b>Lasix?</b>

288
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:21,830
<b>Can you not use a diuretic?</b>

289
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:25,630
<b>I'll be in pain anyway.</b>

290
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:29,420
<b>Sir. If you have trouble urinating,</b>

291
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:31,720
<b>the heart may stretch
and cause shortness of breath.</b>

292
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,050
<b>The potassium level from this morning
was quite high,</b>

293
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,390
<b>so we have to use a diuretic.</b>

294
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:38,890
<b>Either way, I won't be able to live.</b>

295
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:40,560
<b>Just leave me in peace, please.</b>

296
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,020
<b>I don't want Lasix.</b>

297
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,070
<b>Sure, if that's what you want.</b>

298
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,490
<b>I've heard all sorts of bad things

00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,580
<b>How come no one complains about him?</b>

300
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,830
<b>Isn't it obvious?</b>

301
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,290
<b>All he cares about is money.</b>

302
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,630
<b>Why do you think he manages CS
when he's so busy?</b>

303
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:11,510
<b>The answer is obvious.</b>

304
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:34,490
<b>MY RIDICULOUS APPOINTMENT

<b>ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANT TO DELETE THIS POST?</b>

306
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,500
<b>POST DELETED</b>

307
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,350
<b>Is your headache that bad?</b>

308
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:01,810
<b>No, a mild one.</b>

309
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:04,270
<b>But you should take one right away.</b>

310
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,520
<b>Right, Doctor?</b>

311
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,280
<b>Why did it go to the medical office?</b>

312
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:17,070
<b>Jeong-won, can you come with me?
This package is quite big.</b>

313
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,030
<b>Sure.</b>

314
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,160
<b>Go. I'll clean up.</b>

315
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,490
<b>Hey, what did you buy this time?</b>

316
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,410
<b>A wood stove.</b>

317
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,250
<b>A wood stove?</b>

318
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,460
<b>Good choice.</b>

319
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,460
<b>Do everything you want to do
to stay healthy.</b>

320
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:34,510
<b>Great purchase. Well done.</b>

321
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:36,760
<b>See? The doctor said the same thing.</b>

322
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,840
<b>Don't keep it all inside. Let it out.</b>

323
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:42,510
<b>Don't let your thoughts
overload your mind. Just say it.</b>

324
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,430
<b>Just say whatever you're thinking.</b>

325
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,270
<b>Okay? Got it?</b>

326
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:51,020
<b>Okay. I heard you,
so please look straight ahead</b>

327
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,730
<b>and keep your hands on the steering wheel.</b>

328
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,490
<b>I don't want to die
on the same day as you.</b>

329
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:58,410
<b>Okay, I'll focus and just drive.</b>

330
00:18:58,820 --> 00:18:59,860
<b>-Jeez.
-Hey.</b>

331
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:03,540
<b>It's so nice to hear you just blurt
things out. Even I feel much better now.</b>

332
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,670
<b>By the way, does Jeong-won really want
to quit being a doctor?</b>

333
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,500
<b>Don't tell me he wants
to become a priest as well.</b>

334
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:14,920
<b>Yes, he does.</b>

335
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,430
<b>He said he also wants to live
as a child of God now.</b>

336
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:19,430
<b>Oh, dear.</b>

337
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,260
<b>He'll work until the end of the year</b>

338
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:24,640
<b>and move to Italy to go to the seminary.</b>

339
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,100
<b>The ones in Korea have age limits.</b>

340
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:28,850
<b>They already accepted
his recommendation letters.</b>

341
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,940
<b>After an in-person meeting,
all will be set.</b>

342
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:32,810
<b>Gosh, I'm so upset.</b>

343
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,320
<b>My goodness.</b>

344
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:38,110
<b>What's up with your kids?</b>

345
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:41,740
<b>I mean, this is pretty crazy. Goodness.</b>

346
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:43,910
<b>You're laughing?</b>

347
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:46,160
<b>What, then? Should I be crying?</b>

348
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,870
<b>Rosa.</b>

349
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,630
<b>I have to say,</b>

350
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:56,880
<b>this is much better than having children
who are selfish troublemakers.</b>

351
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:59,550
<b>You raised wonderful, responsible kids.</b>

352
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:02,050
<b>They all have such kind hearts.</b>

353
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,970
<b>Just seeing them puts me in a happy mood.</b>

354
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,600
<b>They left their aging mother alone</b>

355
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,480
<b>and went on to become children of God.
If that's not being selfish,</b>

356
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,230
<b>what is?</b>

357
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,060
<b>They put you in a happy mood?</b>

358
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:16,570
<b>My blood boils whenever I see them.</b>

359
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:19,990
<b>I won't comment on other things,</b>

360
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:25,030
<b>but it'd be a shame for Jeong-won
to quit his job as a doctor.</b>

361
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:29,250
<b>There aren't a lot of doctors like him.</b>

362
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,370
<b>He has a strong sense of duty,</b>

363
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:34,710
<b>and the way he treats patients
is exemplary.</b>

364
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:37,630
<b>Jeong-won is the kindest one
out of all my kids.</b>

365
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:42,130
<b>He's always been very empathetic
and affectionate since he was little.</b>

366
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:44,220
<b>He's emotionally sensitive.</b>

367
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:48,390
<b>That's why I thought
he picked the best department for himself</b>

368
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:51,730
<b>when he told me he wanted
to become a pediatric surgeon.</b>

369
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:53,980
<b>Then I told myself,</b>

370
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:56,770
<b>"I can finally put my worries to rest."</b>

371
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,940
<b>He always talked about wanting
to be a priest even as a little boy.</b>

372
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:04,780
<b>So I thought I could finally stop
worrying about it, but...</b>

373
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,700
<b>Oh, boy.</b>

374
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:10,870
<b>Buddha wasn't on my side.</b>

375
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:15,210
<b>Tell me. What's your religion?</b>

376
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,670
<b>I'll dabble in all of them before I die.</b>

377
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:20,340
<b>Who knows, right?</b>

378
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:23,300
<b>So you're building a religion portfolio?</b>

379
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,720
<b>Anyway, what are you going to do?</b>

380
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:29,430
<b>Once he sets his mind to something,
he'll do it.</b>

381
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:31,470
<b>Right, there's no stopping him.</b>

382
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:33,230
<b>He takes after me.</b>

383
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:37,150
<b>What should I do?
He said he'll visit me next weekend.</b>

384
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:39,730
<b>I'm afraid he'll end up persuading me
this time.</b>

385
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,990
<b>You should travel abroad.</b>

386
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:43,900
<b>What?</b>

387
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,160
<b>Just don't see him.</b>

388
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,910
<b>Don't give him a chance to talk.</b>

389
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:50,290
<b>Are you kidding me?</b>

390
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:53,370
<b>Should I move to a different country?
I can't avoid him forever.</b>

391
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,960
<b>Hey,
you're the chairman of the foundation.</b>

392
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,290
<b>How do you even run the foundation
with such a mindset?</b>

393
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,840
<b>This is how I do things.</b>

394
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,880
<b>Look ahead.</b>

395
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:05,930
<b>Time is key.</b>

396
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:09,010
<b>Time is the solution to some problems.</b>

397
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:11,510
<b>If you can't find a solution now</b>

398
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:15,020
<b>no matter how hard you rack your brain,</b>

399
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,480
<b>just avoid the problem for now.</b>

400
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:22,110
<b>If you avoid the problem
for as long as possible,</b>

401
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:25,900
<b>things could change with time.
Oftentimes, that's what happens.</b>

402
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:30,910
<b>So for now, give him whatever excuse
you can think of and just avoid him.</b>

403
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,200
<b>Okay?</b>

404
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,830
<b>-What are we eating by the way?
-<i>Jajangmyeon.</i></b>

405
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:41,290
<b>I don't know why, but I've been craving

<i><b>Jajangmyeon</i>?</b>

407

00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,260
<b>Just say it.</b>

<b>Rosa, don't keep it all inside.

<b>What do you feel like eating?</b>

413
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:06,860
<b>I want a drink.</b>

414
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,070
<b>Let's grab a drink.</b>

415
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:13,990
<b>All right.</b>

416
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:21,170
<b>Nothing abnormal with electrolytes, right?</b>

417
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:25,000
<b>That's good. The patient can be discharged
around Friday</b>

<b>Ji-won, are you upset

<b>-Really?

<b>I don't love kids that much.</b>

<b>But I love my nieces and nephews.
U-ju is so cute.</b>

<b>Hey.</b>

448

<b>You're really something.</b>

00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:10,820
<b>That's why you're always broke.</b>

450
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:14,490
<b>Gosh, how can you live like that?</b>

451
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:16,910
<b>You're impressive.</b>

452
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,080
<b>I have to say, I have big respect for you.</b>

453
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:22,750
<b>I'm impressed.</b>

454
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:25,580
<b>Don't be. I started doing it by chance,</b>

455
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,960
<b>but it just became this big.</b>

456
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:30,710
<b>Song-hwa, the thing is...</b>

457
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,010
<b>I want you</b>

458
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:35,640
<b>to be Daddy-Long-Legs from now on.</b>

459
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:40,220
<b>I've been meaning to ask you
since the spring,</b>

460
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:42,770
<b>but it's been quite hectic
since I moved to this hospital,</b>

461
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:44,890
<b>so I couldn't tell you sooner.</b>

462
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:48,480
<b>If you're okay with it,</b>

463
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:53,030
<b>I'd like you to be Daddy-Long-Legs
in my place.</b>

464
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:59,120
<b>But how? I don't have that kind of money.</b>

465
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,700
<b>Unlike you, I don't come from money.</b>

466
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,500
<b>I've already figured out a way.</b>

467
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:05,080
<b>How?</b>

468
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:07,710
<b>I was given management of all the profits</b>

469
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:10,630
<b>from the VIP Ward after I renounced
the inheritance of the foundation.</b>

470
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:12,420
<b>Mr. Ju has agreed to it as well.</b>

471
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:14,880
<b>But he has no idea
where it's used, of course.</b>

472
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,340
<b>So that money will support the program?</b>

473
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:22,270
<b>Then why can't you keep doing it?</b>

474
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:25,180
<b>I'll do it just until the end of the year.</b>

475
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:29,520
<b>I'll leave the hospital after that.</b>

476
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:36,030
<b>Later.</b>

477
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:39,490
<b>I'll tell you guys at once
when we're all together.</b>

478
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:45,290
<b>So you'll do it, right?</b>

479
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:46,960
<b>Can I take that as a yes?</b>

480
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,420
<b>Thanks.</b>

481
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,340
<b>No problem.</b>

482
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:02,350
<b>-Jeong-won, are you really--
-Later.</b>

483
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,520
<b>I'll tell you everything later on.</b>

484
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,690
<b>But the VIP Ward...</b>

485
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:14,530
<b>Aren't the numbers up and down?</b>

486
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,740
<b>There are only a handful of rooms.
I know they get packed at times,</b>

487
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:21,160
<b>but the rooms can be empty for months
when it's quiet.</b>

488
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:25,500
<b>Shall I look into other ways
to fund the program?</b>

489
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:27,710
<b>No, there's no need.</b>

490
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:31,170
<b>Someone's pulling in
a lot of money for us at the moment.</b>

491
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,960
<b>Ik-jun, right?</b>

492
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,090
<b>Yes, the word has spread.</b>

493
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:44,760
<b>High-ranking officials and celebrities are
recommending us to their acquaintances,</b>

494
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:46,850
<b>so we keep getting new patients.</b>

495
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:51,350
<b>-That patient will be discharged tomorrow.
-Who?</b>

496
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,360
<b>The Prince.</b>

497
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:56,190
<b>The Prince of Dubai.</b>

498
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,280
<b>You heard about tomorrow, right?</b>

499
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:01,390
<b>You heard that your mother
is being discharged tomorrow, right?</b>

500
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:03,100
<b>Yes, I heard from Dr. Lee.</b>

501
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,600
<b>Thank you very much.</b>

502
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,390
<b>I never thought that my mom
would be able to go home this soon.</b>

503
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,400
<b>She and I are trutly grateful for the care</b>

504
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,520
<b>that the staff of Yulje Medical Center</b>

505
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:13,610
<b>and Dr. Lee have provided.</b>

506
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:16,500
<b>He said he heard about it from Dr. Lee
and that he's very grateful.</b>

507
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:20,050
<b>He never thought his mother

508
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:21,800
<b>Both he and his mother are very grateful</b>

509
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:25,050
<b>for the care that the staff
and Dr. Lee Ik-jun have provided.</b>

510

<b>This is the balance
after deducting the prepayment.</b>

511
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,850
<b>The bill includes fees for your mother’s
hospitalization,</b>

512

<b>surgical procedure, and medical tests.</b>

513
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,150
<b>Since she does not have health insurance,
the bill is quite large.</b>

514
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:40,650
<b>You can pay with a credit card
or in installments,</b>

<b>whichever way you prefer.</b>

<b>...or in installments,

517

<b>I will pay fully in cash today.</b>

518
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:51,750
<b>He'd like to pay in full in cash today.</b>

519
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:19,940
<b>Gosh, I'm exhausted.</b>

520
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,150
<b>What are those roses for?</b>

521
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:25,030
<b>Are you seeing someone?</b>

522
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,070
<b>Hello.</b>

523
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:28,740
<b>Someone gave you roses?</b>

524

<b>Yes.</b>

525
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:37,630
<b>What's up? What's going on?</b>

526
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:40,880
<b>Hey, Gyeo-ul. Did someone propose to you?</b>

527
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:44,090
<b>-Well...
-My gosh, seriously?</b>

528
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,720
<b>Is everyone here?</b>

529
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:49,930
<b>Hey, Gyeo-ul. Can you scrub in today?</b>

530

<b>Professor, it looks like</b>

<b>our dear Gyeo-ul must be dating someone.

<b>What? Really?</b>

533
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:02,190
<b>That means we've proved to the world

534
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,190
<b>That's right.</b>

535

<b>She's the living proof

<b>-Gyeo-ul is seeing someone.

<b>Congratulations.</b>

539
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:18,790
<b>See that? Look!</b>

540

<b>Those of us in GS can date too!</b>

541

<b>Seriously, dude!
Just look at the living proof.</b>

542
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,130
<b>We can have

<b>Go tell everyone in your department.</b>

<b>A GS resident can see someone,</b>

<b>and get roses and do all kinds of things.</b>

546

<b>This can happen to everyone in GS.</b>

<b>-Okay?
-Gyeo-ul.</b>

548

<b>-Never give up.

<b>You must make this relationship last.</b>

<b>All right. Let's calm down.</b>

<b>Let's congratulate her no matter

556
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:53,790
<b>All right.</b>

557

00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:04,300
<b>What are you doing? That's not champagne!</b>

562
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:06,670
<b>-Goodness. Here, guys.
-I opened it.</b>

563

<b>Hey, Gyeo-ul.</b>

<b>So what's the verdict?
Which surgery will you assist with?</b>

<b>Have you decided?</b>

574
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:42,000
<b>Yes, I will...</b>

<b>I'll assist

<b>THORACOSCOPIC ESOPHAGEAL ATRESIA REPAIR

<b>What? You sold your car?</b>

<b>Yes, I sold it

00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:12,130
<b>-Doctor.
-Yes?</b>

751
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:15,180
<b>I got a shot today.</b>

752
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:17,260
<b>Really?</b>

753
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,640
<b>My gosh, you really got one.</b>

754
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:22,430
<b>Look at this big, brave girl.</b>

755
00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:26,690
<b>Goodness.</b>

756
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:32,570
<b>How are you so kind and pretty, Yeong-ji?</b>

757
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:35,070
<b>I can't even get one because it's scary.</b>

758
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:38,820
<b>Gosh, you're so brave.</b>

759
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:41,540
<b>Good job. Well done.</b>

760
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:42,740
<b>Great girl.</b>

761
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:56,010
<b>Kids don't lie.</b>

762
00:42:56,970 --> 00:42:59,550
<b>Of course, not.
They are not like us, adults.</b>

763
00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:03,680
<b>When it hurts, they say so.
When they are fine, they say so.</b>

764
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:05,100
<b>They are always honest.</b>

765
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:09,020
<b>But adults pretend
that they are not sick when they are.</b>

766
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:11,110
<b>Even if they are recovered,
they fake their sickness,</b>

767
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:12,900
<b>so they can stay a bit longer.</b>

768
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:15,440
<b>-What about you?
-What?</b>

769
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:18,110
<b>So you don't lie?</b>

770
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:22,580
<b>I'm not sure. Sometimes, I lie.
Sometimes, I don't.</b>

771
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:23,700
<b>What is it?</b>

772
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:26,710
<b>What?</b>

773
00:43:27,290 --> 00:43:28,580
<b>Don't you like Gyeo-ul?</b>

774
00:43:33,130 --> 00:43:35,670
<b>To the point that makes you
question about becoming a priest.</b>

775
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:45,180
<b>If you like her, say so.
I'll keep it a secret.</b>

776
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:46,890
<b>It's not that. What are you talking about?</b>

777
00:43:48,810 --> 00:43:50,060
<b>Are you her spokesperson?</b>

778
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:52,440
<b>Yes, I'm her agent.</b>

779
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:56,230
<b>She's been handling all the tasks</b>

780
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,320
<b>including the chief resident's
since her first year.</b>

781
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,950
<b>But she never shows how hard it is.</b>

782
00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:02,910
<b>We would understand
if she complains or gets annoyed.</b>

783
00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:04,740
<b>She might sulk,</b>

784
00:44:04,830 --> 00:44:07,410
<b>but she doesn't give up or complain.</b>

785
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:11,790
<b>It's just that she has a hard time
sympathizing with people,</b>

786
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,750
<b>but it looks like
she's trying to correct it these days.</b>

787
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:17,550
<b>Anyway, even in the OR, I've never seen</b>

788
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:19,590
<b>a resident in her year
tie as well as she does.</b>

789
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:22,340
<b>She's been practicing that by herself.</b>

790
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:24,930
<b>She cares about the patients
and tries to learn.</b>

791
00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:27,720
<b>I love her mindset as a surgeon.
It's impressive.</b>

792
00:44:27,810 --> 00:44:29,730
<b>-I know that, too.
-I'm not done.</b>

793
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:33,100
<b>That's why I want her to be happy</b>

794
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:39,400
<b>with my friend, Jeong-won.</b>

795
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:49,080
<b>I want her to be happy with my friend.</b>

796
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:50,960
<b>Gosh, get away from me.
What's wrong with you?</b>

797
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:55,540
<b>Hey, Gyeo-ul. Is he okay?</b>

798
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:58,380
<b>That's great news. I'll be there. Okay.</b>

799
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:01,470
<b>I'll get going. Gyeo-ul is looking for me.</b>

800
00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:03,800
<b>Okay. Bye.</b>

801
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,940
<b>Jeong-won, I'm sure He will understand.</b>

802
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:15,610
<b>Besides, when your brain and heart
are saying two different things,</b>

803
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:18,780
<b>your heart is right.</b>

804
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:24,820
<b>Hey. Come on.</b>

805
00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:28,410
<b>Just follow your heart,
then you won't regret it.</b>

806
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,620
<b>Don't make your decisions rashly
and end up like me.</b>

807
00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:32,580
<b>Think carefully.</b>

808
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,830
<b>Thinking that you'll be fine
is asking for luck.</b>

809
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,670
<b>And that kind of luck doesn't happen.</b>

810
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:40,130
<b>I'll stop nagging for today. Bye.</b>

811
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:50,370
<i><b>I gave you</i></b>

812
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:54,790
<i><b>A beautiful bouquet of flowers once</i></b>

813
00:46:55,660 --> 00:47:00,920
<i><b>The radiating flowers and fragrance</i></b>

814
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,510
<i><b>Sadly withered away</i></b>

815
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:09,090
<i><b>Your beauty now
Is more radiating than the flowers</i></b>

816
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:14,140
<i><b>But your beauty will also wither away</i></b>

817
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:19,270
<i><b>But unlike the flowers</i></b>

818
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:22,980
<i><b>We will have love for each other</i></b>

819
00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:30,780
<i><b>You're my loved one</i></b>

820
00:47:30,870 --> 00:47:35,120
<i><b>I will make a silent promise</i></b>

821
00:47:35,870 --> 00:47:40,670
<i><b>That I will protect you</i></b>

822
00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:43,670
<i><b>Until your tears run dry</i></b>

823
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:47,920
<i><b>In the distant future</i></b>

824
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:54,350
<i><b>When we reminisce about this day</i></b>

825
00:47:54,430 --> 00:48:01,100
<i><b>If we can give each other a kiss</i></b>

826
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:08,570
<i><b>In the whole wide world</i></b>

827
00:48:08,650 --> 00:48:12,990
<i><b>For a very long time</i></b>

828
00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:17,700
<i><b>Out of all the people</i></b>

829
00:48:17,790 --> 00:48:22,710
<i><b>I will only love you</i></b>

830
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,690
<b>What does your boyfriend do?</b>

831
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:46,940
<b>What does he do for a living?
How can he drive different cars every day?</b>

832
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,690
<b>Is he a car dealer?
Does he sell imported cars?</b>

833
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:53,820
<b>You only got half right.
The other half is wrong.</b>

834
00:48:58,120 --> 00:48:59,580
<b>Not a car dealer. Is he rich?</b>

835
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,750
<b>-The other way around.
-Is he a car dealer?</b>

836
00:49:01,830 --> 00:49:02,870
<b>Not that.</b>

837
00:49:05,630 --> 00:49:08,000
<b>He's a car dealer,
but he's not your boyfriend.</b>

838
00:49:08,090 --> 00:49:09,630
<b>Yes, he's my younger brother.</b>

839
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:14,390
<b>He sells imported cars,
but he just got a job at the dealership.</b>

840
00:49:15,050 --> 00:49:16,510
<b>He said he can't be late for work,</b>

841
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:18,770
<b>so he's staying at my house
for the time being.</b>

842
00:49:18,850 --> 00:49:20,850
<b>His work is not far from my place.</b>

843
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:24,730
<b>He's dropping me off
because he has to test drive the cars.</b>

844
00:49:24,810 --> 00:49:27,940
<b>But he's such a bother.
Taking the subway is more comfortable.</b>

845
00:49:29,150 --> 00:49:30,740
<b>-But why do you ask?
-Hey,</b>

846
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:34,990
<b>you still like Jeong-won, don't you?</b>

847
00:49:38,410 --> 00:49:41,080
<b>Goodness.
You'll never make a good con artist.</b>

848
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:43,080
<b>I can see right through you.</b>

849
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:47,840
<b>He lies to you
and never says anything nice to you.</b>

850
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:49,550
<b>Do you still like him?</b>

851
00:49:58,180 --> 00:49:59,180
<b>Gyeo-ul.</b>

852
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:03,140
<b>Let people think he's your boyfriend.</b>

853
00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:04,690
<b>What?</b>

854
00:50:08,570 --> 00:50:10,020
<b>Let's gamble just this once.</b>

855
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:21,700
<b>Will he buy it?</b>

856
00:50:21,790 --> 00:50:24,210
<b>To pull off a good con,
you must fool yourself first.</b>

857
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:28,210
<b>Pretend you didn't get dealt a bad hand.
It's a straight flush.</b>

858
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:31,000
<b>I don't know much about poker.</b>

859
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:36,380
<b>Pretend that you have a boyfriend,
not a younger brother.</b>

860
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:39,350
<b>Convince yourself the one who gave you
these roses is your boyfriend.</b>

861
00:50:41,470 --> 00:50:42,930
<b>They should be here soon. Go inside.</b>

862
00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:46,270
<b>Thank you.</b>

863
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:48,060
<b>If you want to thank me,</b>

864
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:50,650
<b>you can pick my surgery today.</b>

<b>MEDICAL OFFICE 1, GENERAL SURGERY</b>

866

<b>Do you know what time it is?</b>

887

<b>Say the last sentence.</b>

903
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:39,860
<b>I am</b>

904
00:53:40,690 --> 00:53:42,360
<b>-an intellectual.
-Let's eat.</b>

905
00:53:46,030 --> 00:53:47,910
<b>Chi-hong, right here. There he is.</b>

906
00:53:51,290 --> 00:53:52,580
<b>Professor Chae,</b>

907
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:54,620
<b>I'm trying to write my thesis paper.</b>

908
00:53:54,710 --> 00:53:57,630
<b>Which part should I tackle first?
The introduction or the method?</b>

909
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:01,210
<b>Draw a conclusion first
if you're done with your research.</b>

910
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:04,380
<b>Use statistics to make tables
and find figures for the thesis paper.</b>

911
00:54:04,470 --> 00:54:06,090
<b>I can help you with the statistics.</b>

912
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:09,100
<b>-Thank you.
-You didn't have lunch yet?</b>

913
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:11,060
<b>No. I just finished my surgery.</b>

914
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:14,690
<b>Hello, Dr. Ahn. Everything is good, right?</b>

915
00:54:14,770 --> 00:54:15,810
<b>You're having a late lunch.</b>

916
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:17,400
<b>Yes.</b>

917
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:19,980
<b>You didn't get a tangerine? Here you go.</b>

918
00:54:20,610 --> 00:54:21,480
<b>Thank you.</b>

919
00:54:22,070 --> 00:54:23,950
<b>-One more thing, Chi-hong.
-Yes.</b>

920
00:54:24,030 --> 00:54:25,240
<b>Is Seong-yeong doing well?</b>

921
00:54:26,490 --> 00:54:28,780
<b>-Yes, of course.
-Don't bully him, okay?</b>

922
00:54:29,450 --> 00:54:30,950
<b>I know that you guys wouldn't do that,</b>

923
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:33,330
<b>but try to be more considerate of him.
Do it openly, okay?</b>

924
00:54:33,410 --> 00:54:35,040
<b>Okay. Of course.</b>

925
00:54:35,870 --> 00:54:39,130
<b>It doesn't bother us,
but I think it bothers him a lot.</b>

926
00:54:48,470 --> 00:54:50,430
<b>Seong-yeong, did you have lunch?</b>

927
00:54:50,510 --> 00:54:51,890
<b>Yes. I did.</b>

928
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:57,980
<b>I'll say this one last time.
And I'll stop saying it.</b>

929
00:54:58,060 --> 00:54:59,230
<b>Don't do it.</b>

930
00:54:59,310 --> 00:55:03,570
<b>Professor Chae was scolded
at the meeting with other professors.</b>

931
00:55:03,650 --> 00:55:06,110
<b>No, she wasn't scolded.
She was disrespected.</b>

932
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:08,530
<b>It was disrespectful on another level.</b>

933
00:55:08,610 --> 00:55:10,200
<b>They said NS residents were such tools.</b>

934
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:13,620
<b>If it weren't for Professor Chae,</b>

935
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:15,790
<b>you would've been crushed to pieces.</b>

936
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:18,080
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

937
00:55:18,170 --> 00:55:19,920
<b>Dr. Yong, please stop.</b>

938
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
<b>That's enough.</b>

939
00:55:24,130 --> 00:55:25,550
<b>Is the intern here?</b>

940
00:55:26,130 --> 00:55:27,720
<b>Hello, I'm the intern.</b>

941
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:29,890
<b>I need to talk to you.</b>

942
00:55:31,010 --> 00:55:31,850
<b>Okay.</b>

943
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:36,560
<b>Hey.</b>

944
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:39,770
<b>Don't be scared. Okay?
Just show him what you've got.</b>

945
00:55:39,850 --> 00:55:42,230
<b>What are you saying?
You must be out of your mind.</b>

946
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:43,730
<b>Are you a kid?</b>

947
00:55:45,690 --> 00:55:48,780
<b>Seong-yeong, it was your fault.
Apologize to him and say you're sorry.</b>

948
00:55:49,450 --> 00:55:50,740
<b>That's the right thing to do.</b>

949
00:55:51,490 --> 00:55:52,410
<b>Okay.</b>

950
00:55:52,490 --> 00:55:55,290
<b>Go to him. I'll buy you a beer next time.</b>

951
00:55:55,950 --> 00:55:56,790
<b>Okay.</b>

952
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,080
<b>Thank you.</b>

953
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:03,920
<b>Gosh.</b>

954
00:56:05,210 --> 00:56:06,090
<b>Goodness.</b>

955
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:11,090
<b>Hey, Ik-jun.</b>

956
00:56:11,470 --> 00:56:12,800
<b>What is it, Jun-wan?</b>

957
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:15,260
<b>Your legs.</b>

958
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:17,100
<b>What?</b>

959
00:56:17,930 --> 00:56:18,980
<b>How about a drink with me tonight?</b>

960
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:20,650
<b>I have surgery later.</b>

961
00:56:20,730 --> 00:56:22,980
<b>What surgery? You have
a lot of surgeries these days.</b>

962
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:26,150
<b>I'm doing
Professor Kwon Sun-jeong a favor.</b>

963
00:56:26,230 --> 00:56:27,740
<b>I'm doing a total hepatectomy
on the recipient.</b>

964
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:29,570
<b>-At this hour?
-Why all of a sudden?</b>

965
00:56:29,650 --> 00:56:31,740
<b>The recipient's blood pressure went down
this morning.</b>

966
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:34,450
<b>Cardiology had to look at the ultrasound,
so the surgery got pushed.</b>

967
00:56:34,530 --> 00:56:36,830
<b>There was a brain-dead patient,
so Se-hyeok went there.</b>

968
00:56:36,910 --> 00:56:37,790
<b>What is it?</b>

969
00:56:38,790 --> 00:56:39,830
<b>It's nothing.</b>

970
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:42,380
<b>I just wanted us to talk about stuff.</b>

971
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:43,630
<b>How about after surgery?</b>

972
00:56:43,710 --> 00:56:44,880
<b>I have a lecture today.</b>

973
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:48,920
<b>All right. I'll go over to
your house later. later. I miss U-ju, too.</b>

974
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:53,090
<b>My babysitter's daughter
came to Korea today,</b>

975
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,510
<b>so I gave her a day off
to be with her daughter.</b>

976
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:57,010
<b>So I'm putting U-ju to sleep today.</b>

977
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:58,980
<b>What? What's going on?</b>

978
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:01,060
<b>I'm dying to find out, too.</b>

979
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:04,900
<b>It's nothing. I just</b>

980
00:57:06,230 --> 00:57:07,860
<b>wanted to talk about life.</b>

981
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:10,360
<b>Then, it's a load of nonsense.</b>

982
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:13,360
<b>Just text me. Leave me messages.</b>

983
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:15,990
<b>Dr. Ahn.</b>

984
00:57:17,450 --> 00:57:19,290
<b>Have you been talking to Ik-sun lately?</b>

985
00:57:19,370 --> 00:57:20,370
<b>Is she doing well?</b>

986
00:57:20,450 --> 00:57:22,330
<b>Yes, we talked yesterday, too.</b>

987
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:25,420
<b>Around midnight?
Or was it early in the morning?</b>

988
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:28,840
<b>Really? You guys are really close.</b>

989
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:30,380
<b>You guys talk late at night.</b>

990
00:57:31,050 --> 00:57:32,680
<b>We are both night owls.</b>

991
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:34,720
<b>So we talk about a lot of things.</b>

992
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:36,470
<b>Isn't midnight</b>

993
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:38,810
<b>too late</b>

994
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:41,020
<b>to talk to your friend?</b>

995
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:46,400
<b>That's a load of crap.</b>

996
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:48,570
<b>Are you a geezer?</b>

997
00:57:48,650 --> 00:57:49,820
<b>It's okay.</b>

998
00:57:50,650 --> 00:57:52,570
<b>But we always talk on the phone
around that time.</b>

999
00:57:53,150 --> 00:57:54,030
<b>"We"?</b>

1000
00:57:54,490 --> 00:57:56,780
<b>All right, then.
Is my younger sister doing okay?</b>

1001
00:57:57,450 --> 00:57:59,450
<b>Yes. She's doing well.</b>

1002
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:01,250
<b>You probably don't know.</b>

1003
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:04,420
<b>-She got it.
-Got what?</b>

1004
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:06,040
<b>The doctorate program she applied to.</b>

1005
00:58:06,130 --> 00:58:07,750
<b>She was the only one who got in.</b>

1006
00:58:08,130 --> 00:58:11,050
<b>Did you know she was preparing
to get a doctorate?</b>

1007
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:12,380
<b>I guess she was.</b>

1008
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:15,720
<b>Go on. What happens now that she got in?</b>

1009
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:17,760
<b>It's a three-year program in England.</b>

1010
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:22,520
<b>-Really?
-Will she be in England for three years?</b>

1011
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:24,810
<b>Yes. There was only one spot,
and she got it.</b>

1012
00:58:24,890 --> 00:58:27,770
<b>Gosh. Seriously. She's so smart.</b>

1013
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:30,440
<b>Does it mean I can't see
my sister for three years?</b>

1014
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:33,690
<b>Gosh. Come on.</b>

1015
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:36,950
<b>If she was planning something like this,
she should have told me.</b>

1016
00:58:37,030 --> 00:58:39,200
<b>We're strangers.
No, even strangers know more about her.</b>

1017
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:40,120
<b>I've got to go.</b>

1018
00:58:43,330 --> 00:58:44,500
<b>Enjoy your meal.</b>

1019
00:59:04,850 --> 00:59:06,350
<b>What's wrong with this guy?</b>

1020
00:59:07,350 --> 00:59:10,560
<b>This is Professor Jeon Jun-woo.
He's a psychiatrist.</b>

1021
00:59:12,190 --> 00:59:14,690
<b>He's two years older than me.
We went to the same college.</b>

1022
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:19,450
<b>I'm used to his mess,
so it doesn't really bother me.</b>

1023
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:23,910
<b>This way. Come take a seat.</b>

1024
00:59:24,250 --> 00:59:25,450
<b>Where's coffee?</b>

1025
00:59:27,750 --> 00:59:29,000
<b>My gosh.</b>

1026
00:59:29,580 --> 00:59:32,500
<b>Talk to Jeong-won and get a new office.</b>

1027
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:34,420
<b>Clearly, this guy needs help.</b>

1028
00:59:35,010 --> 00:59:38,260
<b>Mom, this is why I said
we should drink coffee in the lobby.</b>

1029
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:41,430
<b>It's nice to see your office.</b>

1030
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:44,600
<b>I don't want coffee.
I drank a lot of coffee today.</b>

1031
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:45,600
<b>I want some water.</b>

1032
00:59:48,730 --> 00:59:51,150
<b>Everything will be over tomorrow.</b>

1033
00:59:51,230 --> 00:59:54,070
<b>Yes. I'm scheduled to be
at court tomorrow at 5 p.m.</b>

1034
00:59:54,150 --> 00:59:57,030
<b>And you won't be attending,
so I will proceed as we talked about.</b>

1035
00:59:57,700 --> 00:59:59,990
<b>If there are no changes from both parties,</b>

1036
01:00:00,570 --> 01:00:02,870
<b>your divorce will be finalized tomorrow.</b>

1037
01:00:02,950 --> 01:00:04,540
<b>And it will be official.</b>

1038
01:00:04,620 --> 01:00:06,250
<b>Thank you for your help.</b>

1039
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:08,040
<b>I know you're busy with the hospital.</b>

1040
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:11,500
<b>Don't mention it.
I'm getting paid for this, too.</b>

1041
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:14,670
<b>I really like you.</b>

1042
01:00:14,750 --> 01:00:17,470
<b>You're honest.
You remind me of myself a lot.</b>

1043
01:00:19,430 --> 01:00:21,390
<b>Will you be at home tomorrow morning?</b>

1044
01:00:21,470 --> 01:00:23,220
<b>I'll visit you tomorrow morning.</b>

1045
01:00:24,350 --> 01:00:25,220
<b>Why is that?</b>

1046
01:00:25,810 --> 01:00:28,100
<b>Before I head to court,</b>

1047
01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:31,440
<b>I ought to ask her if she had
a change of heart one last time.</b>

1048
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:33,560
<b>No. You don't have to do that.</b>

1049
01:00:33,650 --> 01:00:35,400
<b>You can just head to court right away.</b>

1050
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:38,940
<b>My gosh. You still don't trust me.</b>

1051
01:00:39,490 --> 01:00:43,160
<b>I still want the divorce,
and I won't change my mind.</b>

1052
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:46,330
<b>You must be busy in the morning, too.
Focus your energy on another case.</b>

1053
01:00:46,450 --> 01:00:49,250
<b>When you walk out of the courthouse,</b>

1054
01:00:49,370 --> 01:00:51,120
<b>just give me a call.</b>

1055
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:53,080
<b>Okay. I'll do that, then.</b>

1056
01:00:53,170 --> 01:00:55,790
<b>Thank you. Please do that.</b>

1057
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:00,090
<b>By the way, why aren't you married?</b>

1058
01:01:00,970 --> 01:01:02,380
<b>Are we talking about me now?</b>

1059
01:01:02,470 --> 01:01:06,220
<b>Well, I mean, you are a fine young man.</b>

1060
01:01:06,310 --> 01:01:08,560
<b>Why won't you get married? You should.</b>

1061
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:11,640
<b>Mom, are you here to represent
the Marriage Support Committee?</b>

1062
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:14,940
<b>You tell that to everyone you see.</b>

1063
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:18,690
<b>Marriage is overrated. Why do you
keep telling people to get married?</b>

1064
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:21,820
<b>Marriage can be a pain in the ass,</b>

1065
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:25,740
<b>but I have a handsome
and awesome son like you.</b>

1066
01:01:26,830 --> 01:01:28,370
<b>That's a blessing. Truly.</b>

1067
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:32,500
<b>So you should get married soon, too.</b>

1068
01:01:33,670 --> 01:01:35,670
<b>I have a girlfriend.</b>

1069
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:39,670
<b>Right? Of course, you do.</b>

1070
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:42,260
<b>What does she do?</b>

1071
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:44,090
<b>She's a prison guard.</b>

1072
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:51,640
<b>Who? The wife of
the Minister of Education?</b>

1073
01:01:53,350 --> 01:01:56,810
<b>Didn't she get a liver transplant
two years ago at Kangwoon Medical Center?</b>

1074
01:01:56,900 --> 01:02:00,570
<b>Yes, she did.
But I guess she needs another surgery.</b>

1075
01:02:01,610 --> 01:02:03,400
<b>It's completely confidential.</b>

1076
01:02:03,490 --> 01:02:04,320
<b>Oh, dear.</b>

1077
01:02:04,910 --> 01:02:07,950
<b>Minister Son is my junior alumnus
from high school.</b>

1078
01:02:08,530 --> 01:02:12,960
<b>I think this time, he's planning
to donate a piece of liver to his wife.</b>

1079
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:18,590
<b>Come to think of it,
I should call him a former minister now.</b>

1080
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:20,920
<b>He resigned today.</b>

1081
01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:23,470
<b>He said he wanted to be with his wife.</b>

1082
01:02:23,550 --> 01:02:25,680
<b>Her liver must be failing</b>

1083
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:28,720
<b>seeing she's getting another surgery
just in two years.</b>

1084
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:30,760
<b>Her body is rejecting the liver.</b>

1085
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:32,890
<b>Her face is turning yellow again,</b>

1086
01:02:33,390 --> 01:02:36,650
<b>and her health has gotten worse
than before the transplant.</b>

1087
01:02:37,730 --> 01:02:40,270
<b>On the phone, he asked me to call him</b>

1088
01:02:41,650 --> 01:02:44,190
<b>once we had discussed this
and made a decision.</b>

1089
01:02:45,740 --> 01:02:48,530
<b>But right before he hung up,
he asked me to help him.</b>

1090
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:50,780
<b>It sounded like he was crying.</b>

1091
01:02:55,540 --> 01:02:56,790
<b>Gosh.</b>

1092
01:02:57,790 --> 01:03:00,210
<b>Why do people get sick when they get old?</b>

1093
01:03:01,170 --> 01:03:02,670
<b>Why? Why is that?</b>

1094
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:05,630
<b>If I know the answer to that,
I would have won the Nobel Prize.</b>

1095
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:08,470
<b>Gosh. What should we do?</b>

1096
01:03:09,550 --> 01:03:10,890
<b>I don't know much about her case,</b>

1097
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:13,770
<b>but as it's her second time,
the adhesion will be severe.</b>

1098
01:03:13,850 --> 01:03:15,890
<b>Performing the surgery itself
will be hard.</b>

1099
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:17,600
<b>And I'm worried about complications, too.</b>

1100
01:03:18,190 --> 01:03:21,190
<b>That's why Kangwoon Medical Center
is hesitant to accept her.</b>

1101
01:03:21,270 --> 01:03:24,400
<b>Of course. Performing surgery on
a high-profile patient would be hard.</b>

1102
01:03:25,070 --> 01:03:26,200
<b>It's a given to do well.</b>

1103
01:03:26,780 --> 01:03:28,660
<b>If not, it'll harm
the hospital's reputation.</b>

1104
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:32,490
<b>If I had an excuse,</b>

1105
01:03:32,580 --> 01:03:34,870
<b>I don't want to proceed
with a high-risk operation.</b>

1106
01:03:34,950 --> 01:03:36,370
<b>Are you the surgeon?</b>

1107
01:03:36,870 --> 01:03:38,290
<b>It's not up to you.</b>

1108
01:03:38,870 --> 01:03:41,170
<b>It's up to the doctor.</b>

1109
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:43,340
<b>Who's going to do the surgery?
It'll be burdensome.</b>

1110
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:44,920
<b>Minister Son's wife</b>

1111
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:49,090
<b>wants Professor Lee
to perform surgery on her.</b>

1112
01:03:50,220 --> 01:03:51,300
<b>Really?</b>

1113
01:03:51,390 --> 01:03:53,760
<b>I guess she must have heard about him</b>

1114
01:03:54,850 --> 01:03:57,060
<b>through a VIP patient
who was admitted to our hospital.</b>

1115
01:03:57,140 --> 01:03:59,400
<b>They are saying that Professor Lee</b>

1116
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:01,940
<b>is the best surgeon
for a liver transplant.</b>

1117
01:04:02,860 --> 01:04:04,270
<b>He is, but...</b>

1118
01:04:05,820 --> 01:04:07,990
<b>My gosh, it's too risky, though.</b>

1119
01:04:08,780 --> 01:04:12,070
<b>The success rate for a second transplant
won't be as high as the first one.</b>

1120
01:04:13,410 --> 01:04:16,540
<b>Should I ask Jeong-won first?</b>

1121
01:04:18,540 --> 01:04:22,130
<b>If you think Professor Lee
would be uncomfortable with this,</b>

1122
01:04:22,210 --> 01:04:24,960
<b>I don't even want
to bring this up with him.</b>

1123
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:29,380
<b>We still have a chance to decide</b>

1124
01:04:29,470 --> 01:04:31,680
<b>if we want to take this case or not.</b>

1125
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:32,890
<b>Uncomfortable?</b>

1126
01:04:33,930 --> 01:04:36,220
<b>That's not like him.</b>

1127
01:04:36,770 --> 01:04:39,350
<b>But I'll ask him first.</b>

1128
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:42,810
<b>Let's see.</b>

1129
01:04:48,070 --> 01:04:49,150
<b>ELAPSED TIME</b>

1130
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:53,370
<b>How is it going with the recipient?</b>

1131
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:56,330
<b>Can you check how far he got?</b>

1132
01:04:56,410 --> 01:04:57,410
<b>Yes.</b>

1133
01:05:02,420 --> 01:05:04,960
<b>Sir, he got the liver out 30 minutes ago.</b>

1134
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:08,210
<b>He finished controlling the bleeding,
and is working on the blood vessels now.</b>

1135
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:10,670
<b>He's almost ready.</b>

1136
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:12,430
<b>-Already?
-Yes.</b>

1137
01:05:12,510 --> 01:05:15,220
<b>We saved at least two hours
in the OR today.</b>

1138
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:26,060
<b>You're still here.</b>

1139
01:05:26,650 --> 01:05:28,360
<b>I'll check out reperfusion before I leave.</b>

1140
01:05:28,940 --> 01:05:30,780
<b>You're done. Why don't you get some food?</b>

1141
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:34,910
<b>I have to go to the ICU
to check if the donor is doing okay.</b>

1142
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:41,750
<b>I'm so touched.</b>

1143
01:05:41,830 --> 01:05:43,960
<b>Give me your hands.</b>

1144
01:05:46,790 --> 01:05:49,170
<b>Eat up. And if you want more,
just let me know.</b>

1145
01:05:49,250 --> 01:05:51,050
<b>There are boxes of these
in Jun-wan's office.</b>

1146
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:52,840
<b>Thank you.</b>

1147
01:05:58,010 --> 01:05:59,600
<b>I feel awake now.</b>

1148
01:06:03,020 --> 01:06:04,020
<b>Why are you still here?</b>

1149
01:06:06,150 --> 01:06:07,190
<b>Hi, Gyeo-ul.</b>

1150
01:06:07,770 --> 01:06:09,650
<b>Hi. I'm leaving now.</b>

1151
01:06:13,490 --> 01:06:15,160
<b>Do you have a minute?</b>

1152
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:18,370
<b>Yes. What is it? Hold on.</b>

1153
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:20,660
<b>You know, you just said hi to her.</b>

1154
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,250
<b>-I did?
-Yes.</b>

1155
01:06:23,330 --> 01:06:24,580
<b>-No.
-Yes, you did.</b>

1156
01:06:24,670 --> 01:06:26,670
<b>-I didn't.
-You even called her name.</b>

1157
01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:28,420
<b>-No, I didn't.
-Yes, you did.</b>

1158
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:29,800
<b>No! When? What time?</b>

1159
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:30,880
<b>When did I say that?</b>

1160
01:06:34,590 --> 01:06:37,090
<b>You didn't. Sure. You didn't do that.</b>

1161
01:06:37,930 --> 01:06:38,760
<b>What do you need?</b>

1162
01:06:39,470 --> 01:06:40,310
<b>Right.</b>

1163
01:06:41,350 --> 01:06:45,440
<b>Two years ago, she got
the living-donor transplant from her son.</b>

1164
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:48,150
<b>Her condition is really bad
due to chronic rejection.</b>

1165
01:06:48,230 --> 01:06:51,110
<b>She has a severe case of jaundice
and will get CRRT, too.</b>

1166
01:06:51,820 --> 01:06:52,820
<b>She's not well at all.</b>

1167
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:55,700
<b>Let me check my schedule. Wait.</b>

1168
01:06:56,360 --> 01:06:57,320
<b>You'll do it, right?</b>

1169
01:06:58,870 --> 01:07:01,870
<b>I'll try to schedule it at the earliest
as soon as the donor is ready.</b>

1170
01:07:02,540 --> 01:07:04,410
<b>I might have to do it on the weekend.</b>

1171
01:07:06,790 --> 01:07:09,790
<b>But doesn't
Minister Son Tae-hwan own a building?</b>

1172
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:11,090
<b>I heard he has one in Gangnam.</b>

1173
01:07:11,170 --> 01:07:13,300
<b>He's from a rich family.</b>

1174
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:16,510
<b>If his wife gets the surgery
at our hospital,</b>

1175
01:07:16,590 --> 01:07:19,640
<b>he already promised the chairman
that he will make a donation.</b>

1176
01:07:20,890 --> 01:07:23,060
<b>He'll pay a lot of money
for the medical bills.</b>

1177
01:07:23,140 --> 01:07:25,180
<b>And he'll donate a lot of money, too.</b>

1178
01:07:25,930 --> 01:07:28,060
<b>It'll help
with your Daddy-Long-Legs Program.</b>

1179
01:07:28,150 --> 01:07:31,230
<b>You bet. These days, you're the one
making all the money for...</b>

1180
01:07:31,940 --> 01:07:33,030
<b>That's for me.</b>

1181
01:07:35,820 --> 01:07:36,650
<b>Hello?</b>

1182
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:38,860
<b>Okay. I'm on my way. Okay.</b>

1183
01:07:39,490 --> 01:07:40,320
<b>Bye.</b>

1184
01:07:41,450 --> 01:07:42,280
<b>Right.</b>

1185
01:07:43,290 --> 01:07:45,040
<b>Hey, it's about the CUSA.</b>

1186
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:46,960
<b>Can he donate two or three of those?</b>

1187
01:07:47,620 --> 01:07:49,540
<b>It's a device for dissecting livers.</b>

1188
01:07:49,630 --> 01:07:50,830
<b>The one we have sucks.</b>

1189
01:07:51,590 --> 01:07:52,790
<b>I like his donations,</b>

1190
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:54,590
<b>but ask him if he could buy
a few of those.</b>

1191
01:07:55,260 --> 01:07:56,720
<b>Slide that in, will you?</b>

1192
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:09,980
<i><b>Go. I'll clean up.</i></b>

1193
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:11,940
<b>Hey, what did you buy this time?</b>

1194
01:08:13,110 --> 01:08:14,440
<b>A wood stove.</b>

1195
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:16,280
<b>A wood stove.</b>

1196
01:08:17,990 --> 01:08:18,820
<b>Good choice.</b>

1197
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:20,660
<b>Do everything you want to do
to stay healthy.</b>

1198
01:08:20,740 --> 01:08:23,450
<b>Great purchase. Well done.</b>

1199
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:29,830
<b>Goodness. A wood stove? Oh, dear.</b>

1200
01:08:32,420 --> 01:08:33,420
<b>That startled me.</b>

<b>This wicked, deceitful guy.</b>

<b>What? Look at the time.</b>

1206
01:09:16,210 --> 01:09:17,670
<b>I have a dinner appointment.</b>

<b>Professor Min Gi-jun

<b>Professor Min called him

<b>When I saw him afterward,
he was out of it.</b>

<b>Given his position at the hospital,

<b>Gosh, Professor Chae.</b>

1215

<b>Can you curse for us just once?</b>

<b>Hey, I can be foul-mouthed if I wanted.</b>

1217

<b>I've never heard you use foul language.</b>

<b>Motherfucker.</b>

1220
01:09:58,550 --> 01:10:00,210
<b>You did swear at us,
but it didn't sound like that.</b>

1221
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:03,130
<b>That was completely therapeutic for me.
I've been blessed.</b>

1222
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:11,350
<b>By the way, I offered to buy him dinner.</b>

1223
01:10:11,430 --> 01:10:13,190
<b>But he said he had plans.</b>

1224
01:10:13,270 --> 01:10:14,730
<b>He's still cheerful, you know.</b>

1225
01:10:14,810 --> 01:10:16,310
<b>He was depressed until the afternoon,</b>

1226

1228

<b>Professor Chae.</b>

<b>You even care for interns?</b>

01:10:28,330 --> 01:10:29,370
<b>Can you buy us dinner, too?</b>

1232
01:10:29,450 --> 01:10:31,160
<b>Sure. Why don't we all go?</b>

<b>-Yes!

<b>I have a lecture. I'm late.

<b>I heard this from Dr. Jang.</b>

1237

<b>She said Professor Lee did
eight liver transplants just this month.</b>

1238

<b>He does a lot of surgeries, to begin with.</b>

1239

<b>He did ten of those all by himself

<b>Is it already the fifteenth?</b>

1241

<b>It's a full moon.</b>

1242
01:11:05,650 --> 01:11:07,530
<b>Yes, it is.
It's the 15th on the lunar calendar.</b>

1243
01:11:07,610 --> 01:11:08,740
<b>We should make a wish.</b>

1244
01:11:09,410 --> 01:11:10,780
<b>What wish?</b>

1245
01:11:11,910 --> 01:11:15,580
<b>Please help Seong-yeong not get hurt

<b>-Professor Chae.
-Please.</b>

1247

<b>Do you have

1248

<b>I'm going camping this weekend.</b>

1249
01:11:26,340 --> 01:11:27,720
<b>Should I wish for a good deck?</b>

1250
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:28,890
<b>Something else.</b>

1251
01:11:30,140 --> 01:11:31,260
<b>Well...</b>

1252
01:11:32,810 --> 01:11:33,720
<b>None.</b>

<b>Aren't you going home?</b>

1256
01:11:45,990 --> 01:11:48,450
<b>You go without me. I have some work left.</b>

1257
01:11:49,610 --> 01:11:50,490
<b>Good work.</b>

1258

<b>-Excuse me.

1259
01:12:31,410 --> 01:12:33,830
<b>-Are you Dr. Do Jae-hak?
-Yes.</b>

1260
01:12:33,910 --> 01:12:37,700
<b>I see. I'm Kim Hae-beom's aunt.
He's the patient in Room 6303.</b>

1261
01:12:37,790 --> 01:12:39,160
<b>I see. Hello.</b>

1262
01:12:39,250 --> 01:12:42,330
<b>I just arrived in Seoul.

01:12:43,460 --> 01:12:45,210
<b>Please hold on.</b>

1264
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:49,050
<b>Hae-beom wanted me to bring this now.
But please wait here.</b>

1265
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:10,700
<b>My gosh, why isn't he going home?</b>

1266
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:14,120
<b>Come on, just go home.</b>

1267
01:13:15,990 --> 01:13:17,490
<b>You're still here?</b>

1268
01:13:17,580 --> 01:13:18,790
<b>Yes, I'm about to head out.</b>

1269
01:13:19,370 --> 01:13:23,380
<b>Ms. Oh Hye-jun's baby had

<b>But the baby is doing fine now.</b>

1271
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:26,840
<b>Keep an eye on the baby.</b>

1272
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:28,840
<b>Notify me

1273
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:29,970
<b>Okay.</b>

1274
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:35,970
<b>Good work.</b>

1275
01:13:36,050 --> 01:13:37,310
<b>Good work, doctor.</b>

1276
01:13:44,150 --> 01:13:47,110
<b>Professor Yang, are you just getting off?</b>

1277
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:48,440
<b>Didn't you leave earlier?</b>

1278
01:13:48,530 --> 01:13:50,780
<b>I forgot something.</b>

1279
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:54,490
<b>Can you give me a ride
to the subway station?</b>

1280
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:57,620
<b>Well, that's...</b>

1281
01:13:57,700 --> 01:13:58,790
<b>Thank you.</b>

1282
01:14:19,220 --> 01:14:20,310
<b>What are you doing?</b>

1283
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:27,900
<b>I'm just about

1284
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:31,230
<b>I just heard it from Dr. Ahn Chi-hong.</b>

1285
01:14:31,530 --> 01:14:32,530
<b>So you got in.</b>

1286
01:14:34,110 --> 01:14:37,160
<b>It's all right.
It doesn't matter how I found out.</b>

1287
01:14:38,070 --> 01:14:40,700
<b>I bet you couldn't call me
because you were sorry.</b>

1288
01:14:41,660 --> 01:14:43,160
<b>Let's talk over the weekend.</b>

1289
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,870
<b>Let's find a way.</b>

1290
01:14:47,630 --> 01:14:48,500
<b>Okay.</b>

1291
01:14:49,750 --> 01:14:52,710
<b>Okay. Let's talk in person. Goodnight.</b>

1292
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:54,760
<b>Me, too.</b>

1293
01:15:54,980 --> 01:15:58,280
<i><b>Thank you for not giving up on me.</i></b>

1294
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:01,950
<i><b>I will remember your kindness
for the rest of my life.</i></b>

1295
01:16:16,510 --> 01:16:17,920
<b>Jae-hak, let's grab drinks.</b>

1296
01:16:40,030 --> 01:16:41,990
<b>Your car is so clean.</b>

1297
01:16:42,570 --> 01:16:44,450
<b>There's nothing in the car.</b>

1298
01:16:44,990 --> 01:16:47,830
<b>Anyway, you're full of surprises.</b>

1299
01:16:49,330 --> 01:16:51,540
<b>Did I look like I would have a messy car?</b>

1300
01:16:51,620 --> 01:16:53,500
<b>No. I know that you're neat,</b>

1301
01:16:53,590 --> 01:16:55,460
<b>but I didn't know
your car would be this clean.</b>

1302
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:58,630
<b>I bet your house is spotless, too.</b>

1303
01:16:58,720 --> 01:16:59,880
<b>I'm not neat.</b>

1304
01:16:59,970 --> 01:17:02,390
<b>I don't do anything because
I don't want to clean up.</b>

1305
01:17:02,970 --> 01:17:04,430
<b>I don't have a lot of stuff at home.</b>

1306
01:17:05,140 --> 01:17:06,510
<b>Excuse me.</b>

1307
01:17:08,060 --> 01:17:09,140
<b>What is it?</b>

1308
01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:13,150
<b>I'm hanging up. I'm busy. Yes.</b>

1309
01:17:14,310 --> 01:17:16,020
<b>No, go ahead. Why did you hang up?</b>

1310
01:17:16,110 --> 01:17:17,480
<b>It's just a guy I know.</b>

1311
01:17:17,570 --> 01:17:19,070
<b>He calls me more than ten times a day.</b>

1312
01:17:19,150 --> 01:17:20,860
<b>Ten times? Goodness.</b>

1313
01:17:21,820 --> 01:17:22,820
<b>That's too much.</b>

1314
01:17:28,120 --> 01:17:29,250
<b>Professor, by any chance...</b>

1315
01:17:29,910 --> 01:17:32,370
<b>You're not being jealous, are you?</b>

1316
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:35,790
<b>What? Jealous?</b>

1317
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:40,510
<b>Do you like me?</b>

1318
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:44,640
<b>Do I like you?</b>

1319
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:47,430
<b>My goodness, no.</b>

1320
01:17:47,970 --> 01:17:49,140
<b>But I like you.</b>

1321
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:58,530
<b>That's the station.
Can you drop me off over there?</b>

1322
01:17:58,610 --> 01:17:59,570
<b>Right there.</b>

1323
01:18:06,700 --> 01:18:07,530
<b>Thank you.</b>

1324
01:18:27,850 --> 01:18:28,970
<b>Professor Yang.</b>

1325
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:33,480
<b>Don't pretend
this never happened tomorrow.</b>

1326
01:18:35,270 --> 01:18:37,480
<b>I told you how I feel about you today.</b>

1327
01:18:39,270 --> 01:18:41,110
<b>Don't pretend it never happened tomorrow.</b>

1328
01:18:43,070 --> 01:18:45,910
<b>But you don't have to give me an answer.</b>

1329
01:18:45,990 --> 01:18:47,740
<b>That's not why I told you.</b>

1330
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:51,200
<b>I just</b>

1331
01:18:52,290 --> 01:18:54,120
<b>wanted to share how I feel.</b>

1332
01:18:56,790 --> 01:18:58,590
<b>I won't make it obvious at the hospital.</b>

1333
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:01,050
<b>I just</b>

1334
01:19:02,130 --> 01:19:04,920
<b>want you to know how I feel. Okay?</b>

1335
01:19:09,510 --> 01:19:12,270
<b>Then, I'll see you tomorrow.</b>

1336
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:53,770
<b>Thirty-eight point two.</b>

1337
01:19:58,730 --> 01:19:59,730
<b>There.</b>

1338
01:20:05,900 --> 01:20:07,110
<b>There you go.</b>

1339
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:12,160
<b>Come here.</b>

1340
01:20:29,510 --> 01:20:30,550
<b>-Yes?
<i>-Professor Lee.</i></b>

1341

<i><b>Yu Sang-jun's BP is going down again.</i></b>

1342
01:20:32,220 --> 01:20:34,100
<i><b>So I'm giving him fluids
and norepinephrine now.</i></b>

1343
01:20:34,180 --> 01:20:37,100
<b>Increase norepinephrine
and keep checking if he's stabilizing.</b>

1344
01:20:37,310 --> 01:20:38,810
<b>You're giving him antibiotics, right?</b>

1345
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:40,560
<b>I'm on my way.</b>

1346
01:20:48,610 --> 01:20:50,200
<b>His fever isn't going down quickly.</b>

1347
01:20:53,030 --> 01:20:54,280
<b>Did you fly here?</b>

1348
01:21:57,470 --> 01:21:58,890
<b>When did you get here?</b>

1349
01:22:00,060 --> 01:22:01,890
<b>Ten minutes ago. Let's eat breakfast.</b>

1350
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:03,390
<b>Did you get some sleep?</b>

1351
01:22:05,230 --> 01:22:07,320
<b>-No.
